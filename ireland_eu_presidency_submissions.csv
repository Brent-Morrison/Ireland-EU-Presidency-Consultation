Driving forward an EU Strategy for Plant-Based Foods to support the green transition The European Commission has publicly committed to presenting a Protein Strategy. Denmark has already demonstrated, through initiatives such as Danish Plant-Based Diplomacy, how plant-based food strategies can support climate goals, food security, and economic innovation. Ireland should adopt the promotion of plant-based foods as a cross-cutting Presidency priority, building up on previous European Council presidencies. An EU-wide strategy would advance the work already in place, empower farmers through diversification, support public health and meet consumer demand for sustainable diets. The Blueprint for an EU Plant-Based Action Plan, endorsed by many actors, provides a solid foundation for EU-level action. Safeguarding ambition in negotiations on the Regulation on Animal Transport Given Ireland’s central role in farmed animal movements and live exports, the Presidency must protect the scientific integrity of the transport reform. This means defending strict journey-time limits, banning long-distance live exports (particularly to non-EU countries), and prohibiting transport of vulnerable animals, such as pregnant and unweaned animals. Ireland can ensure that EFSA’s scientific recommendations remain the backbone of the reform, and more generally, that EU policy making remain embedded in the latest, pair-reviewed scientific knowledge. Upholding democratic commitments, including the ‘End the Cage Age’ ECI Ireland should help ensure that the European Commission delivers an ambitious proposal on laying hens, ending the use of cages and including a ban on day-old chick culling across all sectors. This is essential to uphold the democratic mandate of the ECI. Integrating animal welfare into EU trade policy Ireland should champion policy coherence by advancing legislative discussions on applying EU-equivalent welfare standards to imports, following previous European Commission statements on the matter. This protects both animals and EU farmers and responds to clear public demand. Reinvigorating the EU’s animal welfare agenda The Presidency should prioritise continuity in the revision of the EU animal welfare acquis. This includes ensuring that the Commission delivers ambitious proposals and that the Council maintains progress on files aligned with One Health and One Welfare principles. Ireland should carry forward the work initiated by Denmark and Cyprus, especially around AMR and welfare improvements. Together, these priorities would allow the Irish Presidency to lead on animal welfare, sustainability, innovation, while contributing to a competitive and resilient European agriculture sector."

Lower costs and improved public health An EU strategy for plant-based foods would help citizens access healthier and more affordable food options. Diversifying protein sources supports better nutrition and reduces the long-term costs associated with non-communicable diseases. Stronger, more resilient farming sectors Promoting plant-based diversification and higher-welfare systems strengthens farmers’ resilience to volatile markets, climate shocks and disease outbreaks. Transition support and innovation funding create new value chains and income streams. Reduced antimicrobial resistance and improved food safety Linking animal welfare improvements to AMR reduction delivers benefits across society. Better farm conditions reduce the need for antibiotics, protecting public health and reducing healthcare burdens. Fairer trade and protection for EU farmers Advancing import-equivalence rules ensures that EU farmers are not disadvantaged by competing against products produced under lower welfare standards. This supports rural livelihoods and strengthens internal-market fairness. Climate and environmental benefits Plant-based food strategies reduce pressure on land, water and emissions. Higher-welfare, extensive or agroecological systems similarly deliver environmental gains. These benefits flow back to communities through cleaner air, healthier soils and more sustainable local economies. Innovation, jobs and economic opportunities The plant-based sector is one of the fastest-growing in European agri-food markets. By supporting an EU strategy, Ireland can foster economic opportunities for SMEs, food innovators and farmers transitioning to new markets. Strengthening public trust Delivering on citizen expectations on animal welfare, sustainability and fair trade helps rebuild confidence in EU decision-making. A Presidency that responds to citizens’ concerns fosters unity across diverse communities and strengthen the European project."

Communicating this effectively means focusing on outcomes. When policy advances lead to safer food, reduced antibiotic use, improved animal welfare standards or clearer trade rules, these are tangible improvements that citizens can immediately recognise. The development of a European Strategy for Plant-Based Foods offers a positive and accessible narrative through which Ireland can showcase its leadership. The strategy reflects a wider shift already underway across Europe: consumers seeking healthier and more sustainable choices, and businesses investing in innovation. Highlighting Ireland’s role in moving this file forward shows that the EU can respond to societal demand and economic opportunity at the same time. It also shows the coherence of European Council engagement at a long-term scale, building up on previous Presidency, notably the Danish one. Equally important will be demonstrating responsiveness to democratic participation. Delivering credible progress on animal welfare reforms, including the follow-up to the End the Cage Age European Citizens’ Initiative, provides a clear example of the EU acting on citizens’ expectations. Emphasising this connection can help counter the perception of distance between institutions and the public. Communication should also reflect Ireland’s own strengths. Ireland combines a strong agricultural identity with a growing reputation for food innovation and high production standards. Showcasing farmers who are improving welfare, reducing antibiotic use or exploring diversification can illustrate how EU priorities align with national values and long-term rural resilience. By focusing on concrete outcomes, demonstrating responsiveness to citizens, and highlighting Ireland’s contribution to shaping a forward-looking European food system, the Presidency can build a strong sense of shared ownership and reinforce the understanding that EU action supports both people and communities across Europe."

The EU must remain a stronghold for research, democracy and policy-making grounded in scientific knowledge, and avoid the deregulation agenda, when what we need is public trust and support. The EU must reaffirm itself as a bulwark of democratic integrity, science-led policymaking, transparency and plurality. Now is the moment to safeguard civic space and champion transparency, so the EU remains a model of citizen-led democratic law-making."

Member States who signed the Treaties ceded national sovereignty for the sake of a greater good. To safeguard Treaty rights and for the rule of law to prevail, it is imperative that infringement proceedings should provide a proper remedy for EU citizens whose Treaty rights are being denied. The power to open and conduct infringement proceedings is vested in the European Commission. The proceedings may be own-initiative or based on evidence of Treaty violations from complainants. In the latter case the complainants do not become parties to the proceedings, which remain exclusively between the Commission and the Member States in perceived breach of Treaty obligations. Over the course of infringement proceedings, complainants are debarred from seeing and contesting information furnished by the Member States to the Commission. For their part, the Member States may see the evidence from complainants, should the complainants so agree. The complainants possess certain limited procedural rights such as the right to contribute information to the infringement file, to have meetings with Commission officials responsible for the file, to be consulted in advance for their observations should the Commission plan to close an infringement case. These rights are in no way absolute and their exercise is very much at the discretion of the Commission. The Commission is not accountable for its conduct of the infringement proceedings. It can ignore or evade pertinent questions placed on its conduct of an infringement case by MEPs on behalf of their constituency complainants. It can also ignore evidence of Treaty violations supplied by complainants. That the procedures for the conduct of infringement proceedings are heavily weighted in favour of the Member States to the disadvantage of complainants is demonstrated by the foreign language lecturers(Lettori) case, the longest running case of discrimination in the history of the EU. The Commission in July 2025 closed the third of its infringement cases against Italy for discrimination against Lettori. As the case had been referred to the Court of Justice in August 2023, a hearing was imminent. In the context of fair conduct of infringement proceedings, an important point needs to be made here. This is that the Commission closed the case without consulting with the complainants and without considering important evidence of persisting discrimination which they had furnished. The Commission also declined to address important legal points raised in 4 parliamentary questions by Irish MEPs on its conduct of the case. A fifth question to the Commission requesting the withheld information is pending. A third infringement case for the same breach of a Treaty provision is unprecedented. The Treaty of Rome provided for a one-phase infringement procedure. Subsequently the Treaty of Maastricht provided for a second-phase enforcement procedure with fines for non-implementation of Court of Justice first-phase infringement rulings. Together these two provisions were intended to ensure Member State compliance with Treaty obligations."

The proceedings should be more open and transparent. In particular, exchanges between the European Commission and Member States in perceived breach of their Treaty obligations should no longer remain confidential. Complainants should have the right to see and, if necessary, contest documentation from Member States. Similarly, the Member States ought to have an automatic right to view documentation from complainants, a right which at present is subject to the consent of complainants. As well as being unfair and disadvantageous to complainants, existing procedures for the conduct of infringement proceedings are inefficient and time-consuming. The Commission has offices in the capitals of the Member States of the EU. Consequently, it could easily host meetings at these offices and hear the contending claims and evidence of the complainants and the Member States. Such an open conduct of its duties is appropriate for the Commission in the discharge of its role as Guardian of the Treaties. As things stand, the confidentiality requirement prolongs proceedings, and the attendant and time-consuming bureaucracy represents a great waste of resources."

This is that Member States who signed the Treaties ceded national sovereignty for the sake of a greater good. However, it is not for the greater good of citizens of the EU that the arrangements in place to enforce their Treaty rights can work to the advantage of Member States violating their Treaty obligations. EU citizens should have the right to have evidence they submit of denial of their Treaty rights included in Commission depositions in infringement cases. Equally, they should have the right to check the evidence of the Member States in perceived breach, evidence which after all concerns their welfare and the exercise of their Treaty rights. Further, the Commission should not be immune from accountability for its conduct of infringements proceedings. An instructive parallel here is that of how parliamentary questions are handled in the parliaments of Member States and how questions from MEPs are handled by the European Commission. Questions put down in Dáil Eireann, for example, receive a full and civil answer. However, the record shows that the European Commission can choose to evade or ignore questions put down by elected representatives of European citizens on behalf of their constituents. Accountability to parliament and to the citizens that parliamentarians represent are the rudiments of the democracies of the Member States. Unfortunately, these rudiments have not been carried over into the arrangements for the enforcement of the EU Treaties. So, if the procedures for the conduct of infringement proceedings were reformed to correct the disadvantages inherent in present arrangements, this would certainly have a positive impact on the lives of citizens subject to the Treaties and would be perceived by EU citizens as such."

The improvement of arrangements to defend their Treaty rights and the requirement to have questions placed on their behalf to the Commission in the European Parliament properly addressed would certainly make citizens feel more a part of the Union and more represented by Union institutions. This in turn would make EU citizenship more of a reality and create a sense of vested interest in the good functioning and in the future of the Union.

The litigation for parity of treatment predates the present century and began in 1987 with the reference of the landmark Allué case to the Court of Justice by the Pretura di Venezia for ruling. The first of the Commission’s three infringement cases against Italy was opened in 1996 following representations from the Joint Committee on EU Affairs of Dáil Eireann under the chairmanship of the late Michael Ferris, who had invited testimony before the Committee on the breach of the parity of treatment provision of the Treaty. Over this long period many distinguished Irish journalists and broadcasters have covered the case, including the [REDACTED UNDER GDPR]. All the major national Irish titles have covered the case at one point or another. Local Irish titles have covered it too. Parliament Magazine, the “inhouse” magazine of the European Parliament has reported on the case. So too has The European Times. Examples of coverage in the more specialist press include articles in the Law Society Gazette. In the sources and additional information for which Q.5 makes provision I have included only a selection of material from the current year. I would make one final point about the unprecedented number of infringement proceedings to which the discrimination against Lettori has given rise. The Treaties make provision for one infringement case and a follow-on enforcement case, if necessary. In the Lettori enforcement case, Case C-119/04, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice declined to impose fines on Italy as the Commission depositions did not include evidence from the Lettori to contest Italy’s claims that last-minute legislation had ended discrimination against Lettori. It was to prevent a repeat of such a situation that [REDACTED UNDER GDPR], in the context of the third infringement proceedings, called on the Commission to check with the Lettori that the correct settlements due to them for discriminatory treatment had been made. The Commission declined to address the point in its reply and did not carry out the checks requested.

One of the three priority themes should be: “Building homes, developing communities and ending homelessness” Given the growing engagement of the EU in the issue of housing, the scale of the housing challenge facing Ireland, and the particular phase of EU policy work in late 2026, it would be important for Ireland to proactively make Housing a key thematic priority. We would propose that rather than address Housing Supply in isolation, that the Government situate the issue within the broader issues of building secure, inclusive communities and reducing housing precarity and homelessness. This theme would bring together a range of important strands where the EU can play more than a rhetorical role but genuinely effect real change, reflecting both the major housing and anti-poverty strands in current EU work programme. This approach allows some of the social tensions emerging across the EU as result of housing scarcity to be addressed, making the theme more accessible to the concerns of citizens, and less of a technical discussion of ‘return on investment’, land values etc – while still allowing room for these important elements. This holistic approach also reflects the approach taken in the Government’s own new strategy, so that the priority theme grows out of existing and developing Government thinking, rather than being imposed upon it."

222,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b709621d/Focus_Ireland__-_Submission_222.docx,Focus Ireland,Charity/NGO,Housing and Homelessness,National.,3,"During its Presidency, Ireland needs to be seen to take on the major themes emerging at across member states, but also needs to be seen by its own citizens to be bringing our own key challenges to the fore. Some commentators have suggested that Ireland should shy away from discussion of housing and homelessness because our own current situation on these issues is problematic. This would be a mistake, not least in respect of public perceptions of the process. Citizens and voters do not want their leaders to spend time applauding themselves for problems solved but rather to see them acknowledging and trying to solve the problems they really face. Ireland is in a uniquely strong position to lead in this area, with clear publicly acknowledged challenges, along with experiences of approaches which have worked as well as one which have not worked. It also has a new strategic framework at a stage where the key questions of implementation and funding are being considered."

418,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c6d523ff/Statkraft_-_Submission_418.docx,Statkraft,Business,Renewable Energy,,1,"Ireland’s Presidency should focus on accelerating the renewable energy transition across Europe in order to reduce our emissions and to meet our climate action targets. Enhancing our energy security and independence is also essential after Europe’s recent energy crisis, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, exposed the risks of heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. Ireland is particularly vulnerable because of its dependence on imported gas for electricity generation, which leaves us exposed to global price volatility and supply shocks. This underscores the urgency of building a resilient, renewable-based energy system that reduces reliance on external sources. By prioritising domestic renewable generation, flexible technologies, and storage solutions, Ireland can strengthen security of supply while delivering on climate commitments. Statkraft believe accelerating renewable energy should be prioritised through: Energy Security and Competition A resilient energy system underpins investment confidence and long-term growth. The Presidency should ensure that market reforms under the Electricity Market Design and Clean Industrial Deal strengthen competition, maintain investor confidence, and deliver affordable energy. Energy security must remain central, accelerating renewables and interconnection reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels and shields consumers from price volatility. Focussing on the Delivery of Renewable Energy Projects: Wind and solar remain the cornerstone of Europe’s decarbonisation strategy, and Statkraft is proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. According to Statkraft’s Green Transition Scenario, global wind capacity is projected to grow by 8.3% annually and solar by 10.7% through to 2050, but we must ensure Europe and Ireland are at the forefront of that growth. In Ireland, Statkraft is already delivering on this ambition. We currently manage over 1,200 MW of renewable energy projects and have more than 1 GW built or under construction, making us one of the leading contributors to Ireland’s clean energy future. Our experience spans the full project lifecycle, from development and permitting to construction and operation, giving us a deep understanding of what it takes to turn policy into real-world results. As Ireland prepares to assume the EU Council Presidency in 2026, Statkraft stands ready to assist the Government in showcasing the country’s leadership in renewable energy. We would be delighted to facilitate site visits to operational wind and solar projects or share insights from our development experience to demonstrate how ambitious targets can be delivered on the ground. Delivery of Offshore Phase One Projects Ireland is already off track to meet its 2030 offshore wind targets, with the Department now indicating that construction on Phase One projects will only begin by 2030. This means the original ambition of having significant offshore capacity operational by 2030 will not be achieved. This is a serious credibility issue for Ireland as an EU climate leader. If we cannot deliver on our own targets, it undermines investor confidence and our influence during the Presidency. We must use this period to provide absolute clarity and certainty for the ORESS Phase One projects, including timelines, grid connection plans, and permitting, to protect Ireland’s reputation and demonstrate commitment to accelerating offshore deployment across Europe. Planning Reform Delays in planning approvals remain one of the biggest obstacles to meeting Europe’s 2030 climate targets. The Irish Presidency should make faster, more efficient planning a core theme, ensuring renewable projects are prioritised. Across Europe, many countries have not yet fully implemented the Renewable Energy Directive III which sets rules to speed up approvals. The Irish Presidency should lead efforts to make sure all Member States apply these rules. This includes giving renewable projects “overriding public interest” status so they are prioritised, introducing clear timelines for decisions, and creating digital systems to make applications easier. Ireland’s Planning & Development Act 2024 and the introduction of Renewable Acceleration Areas (RAAs) under the National Planning Framework show how legislative progress has been made in Ireland. Grid Infrastructure Investment Strong electricity networks are essential for delivering renewable energy to homes and businesses. Grid constraints are now a critical bottleneck across Europe. The Presidency should champion investment in modern, resilient grid infrastructure that can handle high levels of wind and solar generation, reduce curtailment, and support cross-border interconnection. Future-proofing the grid also means enabling flexibility through technologies like energy storage and demand-side solutions, ensuring stability as the energy system becomes cleaner and more decentralised."
418,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c6d523ff/Statkraft_-_Submission_418.docx,Statkraft,Business,Renewable Energy,,2,"The Irish Presidency should focus on the continued implementation and delivery of Europe’s clean energy framework including implementation of the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 measures. We should also prioritise the European Grids Package and RED III reform to unlock renewable projects faster while keeping up ambition. It will be essential that the upcoming work on the Energy Security Framework revision and the post-2030 framework keeps the momentum for an accelerated energy transitin in Europe – essential to deliver on security, competitiveness and climate. The presidency is an unique opportunity for positioning Ireland as a hub for clean energy focusing on reforms that accelerate renewable deployment, strengthen energy security, and maintain competitiveness. Grid Infrastructure Development Even when projects are approved, they cannot deliver power without strong electricity networks. The Irish Presidency should push forward the European Grids Package, which aims to upgrade and expand Europe’s electricity networks and improve cross-border connections. This will make the system more resilient and reduce costs. In Ireland, our Price Review 6 regulatory framework is a good example of planning ahead for future grid needs which proposes €14.1 billion baseline funding package 2026–2030 period, potential to rise to €19 billion, marks an unprecedented level of investment in the grid. For context, PR5 involved approximately €4 billion in capital investment. Supporting Renewable Energy Auctions To keep investment flowing, renewable energy auctions need to be regular and predictable. These auctions decide which projects get support and at what price. Under the Net Zero Industry Act, new rules will introduce “non-price criteria” such as sustainability or supply chain requirements. These should be phased in gradually so they do not delay projects or make auctions unworkable. Auction design should also allow for innovative projects, such as those combining wind, solar, and storage on the same site. System Flexibility and Energy Storage As more wind and solar come online, Europe needs ways to balance supply and demand when the weather changes. This means investing in energy storage and flexible technologies. The Presidency should promote EU-wide plans for long-duration storage, clear targets for how much storage is needed, and contracts long enough to attract investment. Updating market rules so storage and demand-side solutions can compete fairly will help keep the grid stable and costs down. Statkraft has been leading the way on this in Ireland. We produced Ireland’s first four-hour battery storage facility which is co-located with a wind farm, demonstrating how innovative hybrid solutions can maximise grid flexibility and renewable integration. Our early DS3 battery projects at Kilathmoy and Kelwin were among the first to deliver grid-scale battery storage in Ireland, supporting system stability and enabling higher renewable penetration. Statkraft is also pioneering the integration of synchronous condensers and hybrid grid solutions, with four LCIS Phase 1 contracts currently under construction. These technologies help stabilise voltage and inertia on the system, ensuring that as renewables grow, the grid remains secure and resilient."
418,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c6d523ff/Statkraft_-_Submission_418.docx,Statkraft,Business,Renewable Energy,,3,"The Irish Presidency can make a real difference by focusing on actions that deliver tangible benefits for citizens and businesses while advancing Europe’s climate and energy goals. This means prioritising measures that lower costs, create jobs, and strengthen energy security. Lower Energy Costs and Greater Stability Accelerating renewable energy deployment and upgrading grid infrastructure will help reduce Europe’s reliance on imported fossil fuels, which have driven price volatility in recent years. We know that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy in Europe which is why a more resilient, interconnected energy system will stabilise prices and protect households and businesses from future shocks. Economic Development and Job Creation Investing in clean energy infrastructure creates thousands of skilled jobs across Europe, from construction and engineering to operations and maintenance. Renewable energy projects, and grid upgrades can revitalise regional economies, particularly in coastal and rural areas, while supporting local supply chains. Ireland also has an opportunity to unlock further economic benefits by passing Private Wires Legislation as well as a framework for Large Energy Users. These measures would attract significant industrial investment, reduce energy costs for businesses, and create high-value jobs in manufacturing, technology, and services. By prioritising these policies during the Presidency, Ireland can showcase how clean energy supports competitiveness and regional growth while contributing to Europe’s climate goals Community Benefits and Public Engagement Statkraft and our partners alone have contributed over €3 million to over 500 community groups through the Community Benefit Fund. Promoting these models during the Presidency will strengthen public trust and demonstrate that the energy transition is not just about climate targets but about improving lives locally. Energy Security and Climate Leadership Reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels enhances Europe’s security and resilience. At the same time, faster delivery of renewables and flexibility solutions will keep the EU on track to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, reinforcing Europe’s leadership in global climate action."

As the level of government closest to people’s daily lives, local authorities—working through the Healthy Ireland framework—offer a unique vantage point on how EU policies translate into meaningful improvements in wellbeing, cohesion, and sustainability. In the context of accelerating climate impacts, rapidly evolving digital information environments, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, it is essential that the Presidency Programme is grounded in approaches that strengthen trust, empower communities, and build the capacity of society to anticipate and withstand future challenges. The themes highlighted in this submission—societal resilience, sustainable and secure food and energy systems, connected and cohesive places, and a holistic One Health approach—represent areas where Ireland can provide leadership informed by practical experience across local government. By prioritising resilience and citizen empowerment, the Presidency can help shape an EU agenda that supports communities in navigating misinformation, safeguarding democratic participation, and enhancing preparedness for future shocks. Emphasising localised solutions to food and energy security will not only contribute to climate and biodiversity objectives but also bolster equitable social and economic resilience across Member States. A renewed European focus on place-based working can help counter polarisation, strengthen social connectedness, and ensure that the benefits of EU membership are felt in tangible, everyday ways across diverse communities. Through participatory approaches and meaningful community engagement, public institutions can build trust and improve the design and delivery of services. Embedding a One Health lens throughout the EU policy environment will further ensure that human health, environmental health, and animal wellbeing are considered collectively, supporting integrated solutions to complex modern challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, environmental degradation, and future pandemics. Ireland’s Presidency Programme should therefore emphasise policies and practices that create healthier, more resilient, and more cohesive communities. This includes championing collaboration across sectors and levels of government, encouraging innovation and sharing of best practice, and ensuring that EU ambitions translate effectively at local level. In doing so, Ireland can reinforce the EU’s core values of solidarity, inclusivity, and unity—values that are essential to navigating the years ahead. The Healthy Ireland Local Government National Office is willing to support the development and delivery of a Presidency Programme that places wellbeing, resilience, and community empowerment at its core. We welcome further engagement as priorities are refined and look forward to contributing to a Presidency that delivers practical, people-centred benefits across Ireland and the European Union"

By emphasising community-centred approaches, local empowerment and the One Health framework, the Presidency can help ensure EU policy delivers visible benefits for people, businesses and communities. A central contribution will be advancing coordinated EU action on societal resilience. Strengthening information integrity, countering misinformation and supporting digital and health literacy will help protect democratic participation and improve crisis preparedness. For businesses, a more trusted information environment reduces operational risks and supports consumer confidence. The Presidency can also drive impact by promoting secure, sustainable and localised food and energy systems. Supporting shorter supply chains, community food initiatives and local energy cooperatives will increase affordability and reliability for households, while creating economic opportunities for SMEs, social enterprises and rural communities. These measures also enhance climate resilience and reduce dependence on volatile global markets. Ireland is well positioned to champion a renewed EU focus on place-based policy. Embedding participatory tools—such as the Place Standard Tool—into EU programmes can strengthen social cohesion, reduce polarisation and ensure initiatives reflect real community priorities. This also supports more predictable and supportive environments for local businesses. Promoting the One Health approach across Council work will align health, environment and agriculture policy, strengthening preparedness for future public health threats and safeguarding ecosystems essential to economic and social wellbeing. This integrated approach can also stimulate innovation in green, agri-tech and health sectors. Finally, Ireland can highlight the essential role of local authorities in implementing EU objectives. Ensuring coherence between EU policy and local delivery—particularly in climate adaptation, public health, resilience and social policy—will help guarantee that EU investments translate into tangible improvements in everyday life. Through these priorities, the Irish Presidency can help build communities that are more resilient and connected, businesses that are more secure and competitive, and citizens who are healthier, better informed and more engaged in Europe’s future."

Achieving this requires engagement that is rooted in local experience, delivered through trusted structures, and grounded in meaningful, two-way dialogue. Ireland is uniquely positioned to do this through its strong participatory infrastructure, particularly the Public Participation Networks (PPNs), which represent thousands of community and voluntary groups nationwide and provide one of the most inclusive civic engagement models in Europe. To achieve this, communication must move beyond national-level messaging and be rooted in the lived experience of communities—both communities of place and communities of interest—across the country. These networks, whether geographic or thematic, already serve as essential hubs of engagement, identity and local democracy, making them ideal platforms for grounding the Presidency in meaningful, accessible dialogue. Working with communities of place—villages, towns, neighbourhoods and cities—allows the Presidency to highlight how EU membership shapes local development, infrastructure, resilience and wellbeing. Locally hosted discussions and engagement events can make EU impacts more visible by showcasing familiar examples: active travel routes, biodiversity projects, energy cooperatives, digital hubs or community health and wellbeing initiatives. When people see how EU policies manifest in their everyday surroundings, the value of membership becomes tangible and relevant. Equally important are communities of interest—groups organised around shared experiences, identities or concerns such as youth organisations, migrant communities, environmental groups, older persons’ networks, farming communities, cultural groups or disability advocates. Engaging with these networks ensures that the Presidency reflects a wide diversity of lived realities and supports a fuller understanding of how EU policy intersects with different aspects of society. These groups are also powerful storytellers, able to articulate how EU programmes have supported innovation, inclusion, environmental stewardship and community resilience. Trusted local infrastructure such as libraries, community centres, schools, Family Resource Centres, cultural venues and digital community spaces can play a central role in sharing accessible information about the EU and promoting digital and information literacy. This supports informed civic participation and strengthens resilience against misinformation, reinforcing the wider objective of building trust in public institutions. Youth engagement should be prioritised through partnerships with schools, youth groups, student bodies and creative communities, ensuring younger generations have a visible role in Presidency activities. Similarly, outreach to marginalised and minority communities helps broaden participation and strengthens the sense that the Presidency, and EU membership more broadly, belongs to everyone. By embedding the Presidency within the everyday life of communities of place and communities of interest, Ireland can communicate the values and benefits of EU membership in ways that are relatable, authentic and inclusive. This approach strengthens democratic engagement, builds social cohesion, and fosters a shared sense of belonging to the European project—rooted in local identity, community wellbeing and collective resilience"

Local and regional authorities are central to this, as they are responsible for implementing a wide range of EU-funded and EU-aligned initiatives, including those relating to planning, public health, climate adaptation, community development, energy, and social cohesion. Ensuring that these authorities have the capacity, skills, and knowledge to translate EU priorities into meaningful local action is therefore critical. Capacity building at the local level involves enhancing both technical and strategic capabilities. Technical capability includes understanding the complex regulatory, funding, and reporting requirements associated with EU programmes, such as Horizon Europe, Interreg, the Cohesion Fund, and future frameworks for sustainable food systems and energy initiatives. Strategic capability involves aligning local priorities with EU opportunities, identifying synergies across sectors, and integrating European policy objectives into local planning, development, and service delivery. Strengthening these competencies enables local authorities to maximise the impact of EU investment and ensures that citizens experience real, visible benefits in their communities. The Presidency could highlight the importance of coordinated programmes that support local government in developing these capabilities. This might include tailored training, peer-to-peer learning networks across Member States, and the development of practical guidance or toolkits to assist in navigating EU processes. Facilitating access to best practice case studies—both from within Ireland and across Europe—can accelerate the adoption of innovative approaches, particularly in areas such as community-based climate adaptation, local energy initiatives, participatory planning, and health promotion. Investing in local capacity also enhances resilience and responsiveness. Authorities that understand EU frameworks are better equipped to anticipate emerging challenges, access funding rapidly, and design interventions that are evidence-informed, sustainable, and locally relevant. Furthermore, well-informed and capable local authorities can play a critical role in fostering citizen engagement, by translating complex EU policies into tangible, community-level projects, increasing awareness of the EU’s value, and promoting civic participation. By placing local government capacity building at the heart of its Presidency programme, Ireland can demonstrate that EU policy is not an abstract or distant set of rules but a practical tool for empowering communities, driving local innovation, and improving quality of life. This approach ensures that EU priorities are embedded effectively at the local level, that opportunities for funding and collaboration are fully realised, and that communities, businesses, and citizens across Ireland—and by extension across the EU—experience meaningful, measurable benefits from their membership."

Sightsavers Ireland believes that in the current political climate the protection of international development and advancement of global social development, disability inclusion, and human rights has never been more crucial. In line with Ireland’s longstanding leadership in development cooperation, humanitarian action, and social inclusion, this submission strongly recommends that the Presidency of the Council include a focus on the overall protection of development cooperation as a high level thematic priority with a specific focus on disability inclusive development as a flagship priority theme. The upcoming Presidency offers a key moment to examine future funding and the long-term direction of development cooperation. Ireland should strive to keep attention on securing adequate resources for development efforts, emphasizing inclusive, rights-based, and sustainable financing that prioritizes people."
426,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/aac68bcd/Sightsavers_Ireland_-_Submission_426.docx,Sightsavers Ireland,INGO,Development cooperation,National with possible extension to EU wide.,2,"Broadly speaking, the main policy area we would advocate for a concerted focus on, is the ongoing MFF negotiations of which the Global Europe Instrument (the European Union's main financial tool for international cooperation) must be protected at all costs. In the upcoming MFF, the Global Europe Instrument should remain a primary focus, as it is likely to face pressure for cuts to accommodate other budget priorities. Ireland must ensure this issue is firmly on the Presidency’s agenda to ensure the safeguarding of the proposed budget. The Global Europe Instrument aims to uphold the EU's values and principles globally, aligning with the objectives of the EU's external action, but its funding needs to be guaranteed. Linked to this focus, as a disability rights organisation, Sightsavers Ireland is advocating for Disability Inclusive Development to be an additional priority for Ireland’s Presidency of the EU Council. The rationale which for selecting Disability Inclusive Development as a priority theme is as follows: Alignment with EU Values and Legal Commitments - The European Union and all its Member States—including Ireland—are State Parties to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). Integrating disability inclusion across EU external action, development policy, and humanitarian response is not only a moral imperative but a legal one. A Presidency priority centred on social development and reaching the furthest behind would reinforce the EU’s commitment to non-discrimination, accessibility, and leaving no one behind, as articulated in: The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development The European Consensus on Development The EU’s 2021–2030 Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Global Need and Opportunity - An estimated 16% of the world’s population lives with a disability, with disproportionate representation among those experiencing extreme poverty, conflict, and climate-related vulnerabilities. Despite global commitments, persons with disabilities still face systematic exclusion from education, health services, decent work, humanitarian assistance, and political participation. Ireland has a strong track record in promoting human rights, gender equality, inclusive education, and principled development action. Irish Aid has been recognised for building partnerships with grassroots organisations, advancing inclusive education, and championing the needs of marginalised groups. Ireland’s Presidency provides an opportunity to galvanise momentum for transformative, cross-sectoral implementation of disability-inclusive policies across EU institutions, Member States, and partner countries. By choosing to focus on disability inclusion as a Presidency priority, Ireland would build on this leadership and position the EU as a global standard-setter for disability inclusion in development and humanitarian policy."

Global Citizenship Education (GCE) offers a powerful framework to achieve this by equipping citizens with the knowledge, skills, and values to engage critically and constructively with European and global issues. Through GCE, we can highlight how EU membership promotes peace, equality, inclusion, sustainability, and human rights—principles that resonate with everyday life. Interactive campaigns, school programs, community dialogues and public engagement can encourage citizens to see themselves not just as beneficiaries of EU policies but as active participants shaping Europe’s future. By linking EU initiatives to local priorities—such as climate action, economic competitiveness and social inclusion—we make the benefits tangible and relevant. For Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, GCE can create a sense of ownership by involving citizens in discussions, consultations, and cultural events that celebrate Ireland’s leadership role. Storytelling, participatory projects, and youth-led forums can amplify voices across society, reinforcing that the Presidency is not a distant political process but a shared national achievement.

We also believe that Ireland has a duty as Presidents of the Council, to protect the freedoms of writers and creatives to express themselves. There is much evidence to suggest that far-right political parties in power across the EU are engaging in the active censorship of writers, while in other cases, writers are self-censoring to protect their livelihoods.

We believe that this must be a vital focus of work for the Irish Presidency. EU countries such as Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and the Netherlands have already placed a content levy or investment obligation on streaming services. However, others, including Ireland have so far failed to do so. As Presidents of the council, Ireland can show leadership in highlighting the importance of the AVMS directive, and the levy, with an EU wide approach to protecting and promoting European content in an era of global streamers. Generative AI: Writers’ work is already being used to train LLM’s, which means that wholesale breaches of EU copyright Law occur every minute. It is imperative that the legal and moral rights of humans are prioritized over technology, and that if generative AI is to be adopted as a tool within the creative industries, authors must be in full control of how the technology is used. When it comes to using writers’ work to train LLM’s, only an opt-in system can ever be acceptable. There must be fair and proportionate remuneration for writers whose work (as explicitly agreed in a contract) will be used to train LLM’s. There must also be mechanisms to secure payment for writers whose work has been mined, and their copyright breached, without their consent. Issues have also arisen regarding the EU AI Act, especially around the exploitation of limitations and exceptions provided in the Copyright Directive. These exceptions were intended for educational purposes, and designed for libraries, archives and universities, but are now being exploited by tech companies with a view to accessing, exploiting, and mining authors’ work. Ireland must show strong leadership in not allowing these exceptions to be exploited in such a way across the EU. Collective Negotiation: For many years writers (and other authors) across the EU have faced difficulties in securing the right to collectively negotiate. The ability to collectively negotiate is a vital way to improve the rights and working conditions of writers, most of whom are classified as self-employed. EU legislation was brought in and then refined over several years to clarify the circumstances under which self-employed people could collectively negotiate without breaching competition authority rules. However, in Ireland, gaps in the law have been identified, meaning that writers, via their Guild, are still some way off being able to collectively negotiate without falling foul of competition authorities. We believe that Ireland can be used as a case study to highlight the EU wide imbalance between writers and, in most cases, producers. We urge Ireland, during their EU presidency, to show leadership to comprehensively address these imbalances. An EU Charter for Artists has also recently been announced - and as part of that charter, we need to ensure that, moving forward, artists across the EU are able to negotiate their rights and working conditions robustly but fairly."

Their work across film, TV, theatre, radio, and the games industry creates jobs. Though we exist in a global economy, we must fully embrace indigenous stories from all member states and see the value in stories from different cultures being told and shared. Ireland have already shown themselves to be not just EU leaders, but global leaders when it comes to valuing the Arts. We have an Artists’ tax exemption, and the ‘Basic income for Artists’ has gone from being a pilot scheme to a permanent fixture. Both these initiatives encourage and incentivise artists and writers to forge careers in the creative sector and are respected across the EU.

Through the proposal from the European Commission on phasing out Russian natural gas imports, the European Union has made strides in reducing its reliance on Russian gas, but it remains exposed to external shocks. Furthermore, as Europe’s energy system is progressing on its path to resilience and decarbonisation by increasing the shares of renewable energy, challenges such as grid congestion and curtailment emerge. In our view, Irish Presidency should focus on strengthening the energy security by ensuring the integration and the overall resilience of the energy system. Clean hydrogen can play a significant role in reducing Europe’s vulnerability to geopolitical shocks and increased technical challenges by supporting the uptake of renewables and providing them with much needed flexibility and long-term storage capacities. At the same time, the translation of the EU’s 2040 climate targets into the existing regulatory framework will be critical to ensure policy coherence and investment certainty, in particular on clean energy and industrial decarbonization projects. The Irish Presidency should therefore aim to provide Member States’ input to the Commission’s work on the new framework for renewables after 2030 [provisionally scheduled to be unrolled towards the end of 2026] and ensure the regulatory coherence, clarity and predictability necessary for long-term investments that support the transition towards climate neutrality. In this respect, demand creation and lead markets for clean domestic products will be essential to unlock investments in key industries, ensuring early offtake, predictable prices and providing financial predictability. For instance, lead markets for steel can help sectors like the automotive or construction to integrate clean steel at minimal cost while providing substantial volumes for early deployment. The upcoming Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA) could be a key element contributing to market creation, boosting the European industrial competitiveness and reducing strategic dependencies by streamlining different instruments such as targets, quotas, and public procurement in relevant sectors. An agreement on the EU long-term budget and notably on the Competitiveness fund and its interplay with other instruments would be key to support the new European industrial policy and lead markets in clean products. It should be designed to provide access to public funding and number of de-risking instruments for technologies with capacity to contribute to Europe’s resilience and competitiveness."

In parallel, Council Conclusions on the European energy resilience would allow to look into various option of how to reduce dependencies. The future of mobility. The Irish Presidency will work on the light-duty vehicles CO2 standards, corporate fleets and the review of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation. The objective could be to secure meaningful and achievable decarbonisation pathways and strategic corridors. Industrial policy for Europe and derisking investments in clean lead markets. The Irish Presidency will deal with key legislative files under the Clean Industrial Deal implementation, such as the Industrial Accelerator Act or the European Decarbonisation Bank, and it will lead on negotiations on the European Competitiveness Fund and the Multiannual Financial Framework. Future of Europe’s competitiveness. The Presidency will lead the work on Horizon Europe FP10 which is expected to prioritize clean technology innovation aiming to support the EU’s industrial resilience, strategic autonomy and technological leadership. This approach is aligned with the Commission Work Programme and the EU’s Strategic Agenda focused on strengthening innovation and strategic industries to boost the EU’s long-term competitiveness and resilience. Future of European energy post 2030 framework for RES. The Irish Presidency could play a key role in defining the future European energy framework for the post 2030 period ensuring that RES deployment is matched with the needed flexibility, infrastructure and market reforms."

The Eurobarometer survey conducted in April-May 2024 revealed that energy prices are the most important aspect for EU citizens regarding energy. Further, a survey commissioned by the European Parliament and conducted in early 2025 confirmed that overall cost of living is the primary concern for EU citizens. Curtailment of renewable electricity—the forced reduction of renewable generation due to grid limitations—is a growing challenge across Europe contributing to increased grid fees and prices of electricity for individual and industrial customers. This has a direct impact on the cost of living. It is already costing European taxpayers and governments billions of euros annually, while reducing the decarbonization and resilience capacities of the renewables. Curtailment remains a considerable problem in the Republic of Ireland where dispatch-down of renewables reached 9.5% in 2023 and is expected to rise drastically as more wind and solar come online. Thus, the system as it is now, is more expensive for energy consumers than it should be, or than it needs to be. To reduce energy costs and make a substantial impact for people, businesses and communities across the EU, the Irish Presidency could champion storage and sector coupling solutions, including those provided by hydrogen electrolysers, to absorb excess renewable electricity and convert it into a valuable energy carrier. To unlock systemic savings and contribute to the reduction of cost of energy, the Irish government could work with the European Commission on the new EU Strategy on Flexibility."

Relationships and trade links with other economies worldwide are essential in this regard, as is cutting unnecessary bureaucratic burdens and red tape on business. The Presidency should place a strong emphasis on proposals to improve the competitiveness of EU companies and SMEs, including though burden reduction measures. The work should be guided by the Dragi Report on the Future of European Competitiveness - A Competitive Strategy for Europe. Simplification of existing legislation via Omnibus proposals is a key part of this work. Completing the Single Market, especially in Services and Digital, guided by the 2024 Lette report “Much more than a market” is necessary. We should work towards ensuring a competitiveness check on all new EU legislation, with a specific SME test and a net reduction in reporting burdens. An emphasis on innovation and encouraging start-ups is need. Access to finance for start-ups, scale-ups and established enterprises need deeper more liquid capital markets. The Presidency should promote the free movement of capital in the EU for the benefit of citizens and businesses. The Savings and Investment Union proposal is key to achieving this objective. Competitive EU businesses can in term benefit from existing and new trade deals. The Presidency should work towards the delivery of a CAP budget that will ensure agricultural competitiveness and help that industry to thrive. To ensure that Europe remains competitive and secure, we need to advance innovation in AI, digital, bioeconomy, defence, sustainability, agriculture and provision of infrastructure can build the Europe and Ireland of the future. Security: In an increasingly fragile global context, advancing the security of Europe and Ireland is essential. Investing in capabilities for cyber defence, food security, security of critical infrastructure, combating disinformation as well as traditional defence capabilities will be essential to Europe and Ireland’s future. Ireland should prioritise a coherent European security and defence industrial policy, stronger protection of the Union’s external borders, and enhanced cooperation against organised crime and terrorism. Democracy & Values: We need to fully embrace the values of the European Union. As we see fragmentation in the EU, the EU becomes weaker economically and vulnerable to other markets. Strengthened Democracy ensures a strengthened union. We see many threats to free speech and the rule of law, this needs to be addressed. Misinformation and disinformation impact public debate and democracy negatively. During its Presidency the government should engage very actively in support of the Irish Commissioner, Michael McGrath, and his work developing and promoting the EU Democracy Shield."

By concluding negotiations on the MFF 2028-2034 in good time to allow for implementation to advance smoothly would send a strong political signal as to Ireland’s capabilities, as well as ensuring certainty for our citizens. With the Danish Presidency setting an ambitious pace, Ireland should work with the Cypriot Presidency to encourage such a pace to continue and be absolutely adamant that it will do whatever it takes to conclude the MFF negotiations by the European Council in December 2026. Furthermore, this MFF should prioritise competitiveness, security, migration management, cohesion, agriculture and strategic infrastructure, ensuring that Europe shifts spending towards performance, results and conditionality on reforms, in line with responsible, centre-right budgetary discipline. The MFF should add value to member state. CAP: Negotiations will be nearing completion for the end of the Irish Presidency, it is important that we seek re-instatement of the CAP Budget and the delivery of a fair deal for farmers and for our regions. The Common Agriculture Policy is a major component of the MFF and reform of the CAP and the budget Allocated to it will be an important determinant of EU food production. Savings & Investment Union: Ireland should work to progress this union, free movement of capital is the key to unlocking money that is inactive for the benefit of all citizens. Today EU citizens save, but few invest and they lose out on making their money work for them. The Presidency should work hard to break down the barriers to the free movement of capital in the EU Single Market. These funds can allow us to support European start-ups in Europe rather than requiring US funding. The Savings and Investment Union will allow us to do more with our own money. Health – Critical Medicines Act & Biotech Act: Considering the importance of the pharmaceutical sector to the Irish economy, Ireland should seek to conclude as many health related files as possible to give certainty to pharmaceutical companies operating in that sphere. In addition, Ireland is very well aware that US based pharmaceutical companies are essential to the efforts to combat existing shortages of medicines and medicinal products. Therefore efforts to exclude US companies from European systems should be rebutted strongly by Ireland. In addition, Ireland should pursue a central objective of promoting an open but resilient health industrial base – including diversified supply chains, faster and more predictable regulatory approval, and strong incentives for R&D and clinical trials in Europe, especially in rare diseases and advanced therapies. We should also seek to focus on prevention within key therapeutic areas like HIV, diabetes, cardiovascular and brain health. Technology: The Presidency should seek to advance legislation that boosts European innovation, bringing Europe to the fore of competitiveness globally. Advancement of the proposed Chips Act 2.0 for example would send a strong message that Europe can act quickly when required and when needed to boost its global and economic position in the world. Security & supporting Ukraine: There is a war taking place on the European continent and while Ukraine is fighting its invasion by Russia in a very obvious and concrete way, hybrid warfare is being waged against all European countries and the EU as a whole. As such, Ireland must absolutely prioritise ongoing work and essential actions to continue to support Ukraine, as well as advancing work on promoting European security overall. Enlargement: For too long, the EU has delayed on enlargement plans, during the Presidency we should look to the accession of new member states such as Montenegro and Ukraine. Countries such as Montenegro, Ukraine and others have shown their dedication to becoming a member of the EU and worked closely with the EU to make this a reality. Ireland should use its Presidency to fast-track the EU accession process while safeguarding EU standards. We need clear public diplomacy communicating that enlargement strengthens European security."

Ireland should encourage the Council and Commission to communicate and measure EU policies in terms of real-world impact, for example, numbers of jobs created; hours of red tape saved; reductions in waiting times or improved security, rather than only focusing on legal jargon and related outputs. A Presidency that yields tangible results is what will make a difference for people and businesses. This is especially true for the MFF negotiations, as money from the EU budget goes to every corner of the union. A good deal on the MFF will provide certainty for the coming year for investment in research, innovation, cohesion, Erasmus, agriculture and rural development. Build Consensus: The EU is currently dealing with a number of issues in which there are differing views within its Member States – from enlargement to budgetary allocation to how best to build a sustainable future. At this time of global uncertainty, any division will be exploited by those who do not wish to see Europe succeed. Ireland can make a substantially positive impact by investing in quiet, behind-the-scenes, diplomacy and efforts to build a European consensus on difficult issues, thereby securing Europe in a different yet crucial way. Ensuring practical delivery: While adoption of critical legislation is important, how it is implemented is essential. The Irish Presidency should be uncompromising in holding the European Commission and other stakeholders to account in the delivery of the legislative and political promises that are made. The Irish Presidency should invite the European Commission to the different Working Party configurations to receive updates about implementation plans and actions, and absorption rates of EU funds, to promote and advance the importance of delivery of legislative commitments which will ultimately promote simple, stable rules and predictable timetables, especially for SMEs, farmers and our local authorities who bear the brunt of complex regulations."

All communication activities should take a “people first” approach – and should communicate outcomes as opposed to processes. While communications within the EU system is important (i.e. the technical outcome of a meeting), the high level communication should stick to core messages and key outcomes. Furthermore, communications should be truthful about both the limits and the achievements of EU action. By avoiding over-promising, speaking plainly and listening carefully, Ireland can demonstrate that a pro-European, centre-right politics is also a politics of integrity. In Ireland, bring the Presidency home: For the Irish people, the Presidency shouldn’t be just happening in Dublin or Brussels, but rather in every town and village, bringing the EU closer to the Regions. The Government should take an overall approach and all government Ministers, TDs, Senators and Councillors should have a responsibility for bringing the Presidency to their constituency. This could be done through town hall engagements, visits by Ministerial colleagues from across the EU to local companies or community groups and a social media strategy that engages with individuals and community groups. In addition, the Presidency should partner with local authorities, trade associations, farming organisations and other companies, showcasing how EU decisions support local jobs, infrastructure and services. Ireland is one of the older member states and there is strong awareness of the EU. The Presidency is an opportunity to re-energise the debate Europe - from the budget to security. The presidency should also be linked in with schools through inclusive competitions, school workshops or contribution forums to bring both the presidency and the European Union closer to our youth. The Blue Star Programme is highly effective in bringing the EU to the class rooms and the presidency can provide an added impetus to the Programme in 2026. Encouraging, supporting and funding wider and deeper relationships between Irish Universities, other Irish third level colleges and universities across Europe should be undertaken by the Department of Higher Education and Training. A module on the EU should be prepared by the Department of Education for all transition years students which could become a permanent feature of transition year. A promotional campaign should be undertaken to encourage every student to reach a reasonable level of competence in a European language Stories: Stories are what wins narratives. Ireland has a great story to tell in Europe, from being in the first group of enlargement countries, to benefitting from EU cohesion and Common Agricultural Funds to being the high tech economy we are today, boosted by European social directives and becoming a net contributor. Our citizens benefit from EU Membership every day – let’s share it with the rest of the European Union and beyond. Geopolitics is likely to dominate EU discussions in the coming years and bringing citizens into these hot topic debates should form a key platform for the Irish Presidency."

To keep Europe on a fair, sustainable and democratic path, Ireland should ground its agenda in environmental justice, social equity, intergenerational fairness and strong governance. Ireland should prioritise the following themes: A Fair, Just and Equitable Transition for All People and Regions Ireland should place fairness at the heart of its Presidency by ensuring climate, energy and industrial transitions reduce inequalities. The Presidency should champion: Stronger Social Climate Plans that protect low-income households as ETS2 begins; Integration of social safeguards across transition policies; Commitment to territorial cohesion so no region is left behind; Shared vision of a just transition connecting climate ambition with social protection, decent work, affordable energy and community resilience. This aligns with Ireland’s national focus on just transition and will resonate strongly across Member States. A Climate-Neutral, Nature-Positive and Resilient Europe Delivering the 2040 target will require a coherent, long-term policy framework. Ireland should prioritise: Steering early Council work on the 2040 climate target and preparing the framework for its implementation; Protecting the integrity and financing of the Nature Restoration Law; Strengthening climate adaptation and resilience, including through fairness-centred approaches to risk management; and • Embedding emissions reductions, energy security and biodiversity recovery across Council work. This positions Ireland as a leader in ensuring climate and nature commitments translate into real implementation once legislation is adopted. A Long-Term EU Budget (MFF) that Delivers for Climate, Nature, Social Equity and Democracy As the MFF will be the Presidency’s most consequential file, Ireland should promote a budget that: Safeguards climate and biodiversity ambition; Protects cohesion and strengthens regional participation; Embeds robust social-justice conditionalities; Upholds environmental governance, rule of law and the Do-No-Significant-Harm principle; Ensures meaningful civil-society participation in the new funding architecture. This frames the MFF as a tool for long-term public value rather than financial administration. Protecting Environmental Democracy and Civic Space Ireland should champion a Presidency priority on strengthening democracy, participation and rights. This includes defending NGO participation and funding, safeguarding access to information and justice, and resisting deregulatory pressures that weaken environmental protections. This is particularly timely given the implementation of the new EU Civil Society Strategy and the role of Commissioner McGrath. In addition, Ireland has committed to deliver better regulation (rather than deregulation) – this is a particularly important theme for the Presidency to champion. Embedding Intergenerational Fairness in EU Decision-Making Ireland can highlight long-term thinking as a core European value by promoting: Systematic long-term impact assessment across Council work; A strong mandate for the new EU Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness; Dialogue with youth and civil society on the futures that EU policy choices shape. Strengthening North–South Environmental Cooperation on the Island of Ireland Ireland should promote a theme ensuring EU decisions support environmental cooperation, minimise regulatory divergence risks and protect citizens’ rights across the island."

Ireland should focus on ensuring that the long-term EU budget: Raises climate and biodiversity ambition, including a credible climate–environment spending target and visible, ring-fenced biodiversity investment; Protects cohesion and territorial justice, ensuring National and Regional Partnership Plans (NRPPs) uphold multilevel governance and meaningful civil-society and regional participation; Embeds strong social conditionalities across programmes, ensuring workers, SMEs and lowincome households are protected as transition policies tighten; Safeguards civic space, including structural funding for civil society; and Upholds environmental governance, including robust application of the Do-No-Significant-Harm principle and strong monitoring rules. The Presidency must secure a Council position that aligns the MFF with the scale of Europe’s climate, biodiversity and social-equity challenges. Implementation of the EU 2040 Climate Target Following agreement of the 90% net-reduction target, the Commission will table multiple legislative and governance proposals in 2026. Ireland should prioritise early Council work on: ETS governance and rules on removals, ensuring the target accelerates real domestic decarbonisation and does not rely excessively on credits or sinks; LULUCF legislation, to protect nature-based removals while ensuring environmental integrity; Industrial decarbonisation measures under the Clean Industrial Deal; and Energy-system and energy-efficiency reforms required for a resilient, secure and decarbonised economy. The Presidency should aim to strengthen coherence across these files, emphasise fairness, and ensure the target becomes a driver of domestic transformation rather than an accounting exercise. PFAS Restriction under REACH A major legislative proposal to restrict PFAS (“forever chemicals”) will move into Council negotiations during the Irish Presidency. Ireland should aim to: Defend a strong, science-based restriction with no unjustified exemptions or delays; Promote a fair transition for affected workers and SMEs, including EU support for safer alternatives; and • Prioritise environmental justice, ensuring monitoring, remediation and transparency obligations protect communities affected by contamination. Nature Restoration Law Implementation Member States’ National Restoration Plans will enter scrutiny and discussion phases in 2026. Ireland should aim to: Protect the integrity of the NRL, resisting dilution through deregulation or weakened obligations; Ensure adequate financing, particularly within the MFF; and Promote strong enforcement and stakeholder participation across all ecosystems. Cohesion Policy, NRPPs and the Fair Transition Framework Ireland should focus on: Ensuring NRPPs uphold multilevel governance, participation, and territorial balance; Embedding fair transition safeguards across Cohesion Policy, SCPs and the Clean Industrial Deal; Mitigating household impacts from ETS2 through strengthened Social Climate Plans. Island of Ireland Environmental Cooperation The Presidency should ensure that legislative negotiations consider post-Brexit divergence risks and protect mechanisms for cross-border environmental cooperation."

The question of societal impact cannot be separated from environmental impact. Europe’s prosperity, health and competitiveness depend on a stable climate, thriving ecosystems and a fair and socially transition framework. A Presidency that strengthens social equity and environmental ambition will deliver benefits across all parts of society. Driving joined-up policymaking that connects social, economic and environmental objectives Europe’s major challenges (rising living costs, climate instability, nature loss, industrial restructuring and regional disparities) are all interconnected. The Irish Presidency can make the greatest impact by ensuring Council work is integrated, so climate, competitiveness, cohesion and social protections are treated as mutually reinforcing. This will improve policy coherence, reduce unintended burdens on households, and strengthen the resilience of communities and regions. Embedding Fairness as a Guiding Principle across Council Work Fairness is central to EJNI’s work and essential for public trust in transition policies. By ensuring that every major Council discussion considers distributional impacts on regions, low-income households, marginalised communities and small businesses, the Presidency can help prevent widening inequalities and reduce the risk of social pushback. A fairness-focused approach will deliver tangible benefits, including reduced energy poverty, more predictable and socially balanced transition pathways, and tailored support for vulnerable groups. It also helps maintain political stability and public consent for climate and environmental action. Ensuring environmental integrity and climate stability underpin economic opportunity Even when not explicitly referenced, the environment must be positioned as the foundation of prosperity. By consistently highlighting the economic and social dividends of clean air, restored nature, resilient infrastructure and reduced pollution, Ireland can shift Council discussions toward long-term value creation rather than short-term cost minimisation. This strengthens competitiveness by lowering long-term risks, creating clearer policy signals and reducing regulatory uncertainty for businesses, investors and local authorities. Strengthening democratic participation and civic space Effective policies require trust, legitimacy and public ownership. The Presidency can improve decisionmaking quality by: ensuring meaningful and inclusive participatory processes around major files; protecting civic space, independent expertise and access to information; promoting transparency in negotiations and implementation. These measures lead to better-designed policies that reflect real community needs and are easier to operationalise on the ground. Building long-term certainty through a future-generations perspective A Presidency that frames decisions around future wellbeing can help shift the Council beyond short-term political cycles. By elevating intergenerational fairness and long-term risks, Ireland can support EU investments that deliver durable benefits: safer infrastructure, stable energy systems, healthier environments and more resilient local economies. 6. Modelling cross-border cooperation and bridge-building Ireland’s experience with cross-border cooperation positions it to help bridge divides between Member States, regions and political groups. By convening informal Councils and expert dialogues, the Presidency can reduce polarisation around climate, nature and social policy, strengthen mutual understanding and build the foundations for stable EU legislation. Overall, EJNI believes that the Irish Presidency can make the most substantial positive impact by how it leads on the following: integrating climate, social and economic objectives; embedding fairness and environmental integrity; protecting democratic participation; • strengthening long-term thinking; and building consensus. This approach will deliver benefits for communities while protecting the climate and environment on which Europe’s future prosperity depends."
70,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/0fc4c6fc/Environmental_Justice_Network_Ireland_-_Submission_70.docx,Environmental Justice Network Ireland,NGO,Environmental Justice,National/EU wide,4,"Ireland’s Presidency is a real chance to bring the EU closer to people’s everyday lives. For many, the EU may feel distant or abstract, yet its influence can be felt in very tangible ways. The more we can make these connections clear, human and relatable, the easier it becomes for people to see the EU as something they are part of and that can have a positive impact on their lives and communities. Here are some ways that EJNI believes Ireland can help create that sense of understanding and ownership Begin with the issues that directly shape people’s lives and communities Citizens engage most when they can clearly see how EU decisions affect matters of daily importance such as clean air and water, affordable and secure energy, accessible nature, social prosperity and equality, and resilient communities. Framing the Presidency’s work through these concrete and relatable outcomes, rather than exclusively through institutional or procedural language, can help demonstrate the EU’s value in practical terms and reinforce the relevance of EU membership to people’s wellbeing and overall environmental wellbeing. Create meaningful opportunities for public participation and be transparent about how these opportunities shape the Presidency A sense of ownership can emerge when communities feel that their voices are welcomed and taken seriously. The Presidency can support this by facilitating structured and meangingful engagement across the island, though, for example, dialogues with communities, civil society organisations, young people, farmers and marginalised and vulnerable groups. Ensuring that these perspectives inform and shape the Presidency’s narrative will help make the EU feel more accessible, more transparent, and more reflective of the diversity of experiences within Ireland. Highlight the EU’s tangible contributions to public welfare and environmental protection Many of the EU’s most significant achievements may not be widely known, despite their impact – from, for example, cleaner rivers and coastlines, to consumer, environmental and labour standards, to investment and funding in regional development and restored nature. Communicating these successes clearly and consistently can strengthen public understanding of how EU membership delivers tangible benefits for communities, businesses and the environment. Demonstrate how EU cooperation supports stability, solidarity and shared progress The island of Ireland provides a particularly powerful example of the benefits of cooperation. Showcasing how EU frameworks have enabled cross-border environmental protection, strengthened community links and supported economic and social development should help citizens and communities appreciate the broader value of collective action within the Union. This should reinforce the idea of the EU as a partnership that enables stability and opportunity. Ensure young people are active contributors Young people will inherit the outcomes of the decisions taken during the Irish Presidency. Therefore, their meaningful involvement such as through structured youth dialogues, advisory mechanisms, co-designed events or opportunities to influence Presidency priorities will demonstrate a commitment to intergenerational fairness and strengthens democratic legitimacy. It will also build long-term engagement with the EU among future generations. Use narrative and lived experience to make EU impacts visible While policy language is essential, real-world stories may convey impact more effectively for communities. Sharing examples such as communities benefiting from EU-funded projects, local ecosystems recovering due to EU legislation, or businesses supported through EU standards, should make the EU’s role more tangible and comprehensible and citizens. Communicate transparently about both progress and challenges Trust is strengthened when institutions are open about the complexity of policy choices and the trade-offs involved. A Presidency that presents both achievements and difficulties openly will help foster a more informed public debate and help build confidence amongst citizens in EU decision-making."

The following summary outlines the cross-cutting messages and additional considerations that underpin EJNI’s recommendations. First, the paper emphasises that Ireland’s Presidency takes place at an unusually consequential moment for the Union. The negotiation of the 2028–2034 Multiannual Financial Framework, the start of implementation of the EU’s new 2040 climate target, and the early stages of the EU Civil Society Strategy together present an alignment of files that will shape the trajectory of Europe’s social, economic and environmental transitions for at least a decade. The Presidency therefore carries a responsibility not only to manage negotiations efficiently, but also to ensure that these reforms strengthen rather than weaken democratic accountability, social fairness and environmental ambition. Second, the full document highlights that environmental justice must be a unifying lens. Many of the challenges facing communities such as rising living costs, energy insecurity, biodiversity loss, declining water quality, pollution, and uneven regional development are all interconnected. A Presidency that integrates climate, nature, cohesion, and social protection into a coherent approach will deliver more durable and equitable outcomes than one that treats these issues in isolation. EJNI argues that Ireland is well-placed to champion this integrated perspective, drawing on its national experience of social dialogue and cross-border cooperation. Third, the paper stresses the critical importance of safeguarding civic space and environmental democracy. At a time when civil society organisations across Europe report increasing pressure, reduced funding, and weakened participation pathways, the Presidency has an opportunity to ensure that participatory governance is protected and strengthened across key legislative files. Meaningful participation will improve policy quality and strengthen implementation and public trust. Fourth, the document underscores Ireland’s potential to promote intergenerational fairness as a guiding principle of EU decision-making. With the establishment of the EU Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, the Presidency can help embed long-term thinking across Council work, ensuring that fiscal, climate, agricultural and industrial decisions do not undermine the rights and wellbeing of future generations. Finally, the Position Paper highlights Ireland’s role in supporting environmental and cross-border cooperation on the island of Ireland. The Presidency provides a platform to reinforce the importance of regulatory stability, shared environmental monitoring, and coordinated responses to ecological and climate challenges that do not respect borders. Together, these themes reflect EJNI’s key message: Ireland’s Presidency can deliver lasting benefit for people, communities, businesses and future generations if it champions social justice and fairness, environmental integrity, democratic participation and long-term stewardship."

We take this opportunity to submit some of the contents shared during this meeting through this Submission Form. As discussed on 2 December, VinylPlus believes the high-level thematic priorities to deliver a visionary and ambitious resources management strategy for the EU, in the EU should be: EU’s Competitiveness, the EU Single Market and circularity. The specific policies related to these three priorities are many and currently quite disconnected. We provide my information on how to bring them closer together in Question 2."

One of the priorities for a prosperous and competitive Europe put forward in the European Council’s Strategic agenda 2024-2029 is to reduce harmful dependencies, and diversify and secure strategic supply chains. The chloro-alkali industry produces caustic soda, chlorine and hydrogen. These supply and enable essential consumer, professional and industrial needs and products such medical devices, pharmaceutical, hygiene, food protection, cleaning, water treatment, crop protection, paper and metal production, electronics, construction products, etc. (Cf. https://trees.eurochlor.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/04/chlorine-tree-v4-typo-legend.pdf and https://trees.eurochlor.org/wpcontent/uploads/2021/04/sodium-tree-v2-typo-legend.pdf). This is why these chemicals have been put forward as critical chemicals for the EU (similar to the critical raw materials for the energy and digital transition of Europe). Critical chemicals are key to the strategic autonomy and independence of Europe. Made of 50% chlorine, PVC consumes 30% of the European annual production of chlorine, supporting the economic viability and resilience of this critical industry. PVC is chemically interdependent with chloro-alkali. Because of the chemical properties of chlorine, production of chlorine and chlorine-containing products should be geographically co-located. This means that is the chloro-alkali or the PVC sector weaken or disappear, it is an entire pyramid of interrelated industries and products lost by the EU. By safeguarding the chloro-alkali and major chloro-alkali consuming industrial sectors, the EU avoids harmful dependencies on raw materials and finished products, and secures strategic supply chains. Industrial Accelerator Act, Circular Economy Act: Ensure waste becomes EU’s resource (urban mining) and this resource is managed through coherent product and waste legislation by addressing e.g., ecodesign and recycled content needs, harmonization of EPR and EoW requirements at EU level, obsolete waste classification system, excessive burden preventing efficient transport of wastes destined for recycling in the EU, etc. Europe needs an industrial strategy where decarbonisation goes hand in hand with retaining a competitive industry and cleantech (re-)industrialization. A strong industrial policy also needs controlled energy and compliance costs, as well as regulatory efficiency and certainty, including on possible future restriction needs. Practically speaking, for PVC specifically, this increased regulatory certainty can be improved by removing “PVC and PVC additives” from the REACH Restriction Roadmap. The conclusions of the ECHA’s Investigation Report (2023) and follow-up regulatory developments tackling remaining concerns related to microplastics, flame retardants, organotins and medium chain ortho-phthalates, demonstrate that the “PVC and PVC additives” entry should be removed from the Roadmap. The Roadmap needs to remain up to date to remain relevant; otherwise, it is just another of regulatory inefficiency causing uncertainty for investors. Reigniting market growth and demand for European products: In addition to the above key priorities, competitiveness, the single market and circularity can be delivered by accelerating the implementation of (revised and secondary legislation under) ecolabels, public procurement, housing and construction policies, water resilience strategy, etc. Ireland can help giving hard funding signals supporting immediate investment and demand for “Made in Europe”, low carbon, circular and affordable construction and infrastructure products, with PVC construction products ticking all such boxes."

The Single Market starts with an aligned Member State positioning and support, and the overall EU competitiveness can only be achieved if we act as a single and united region. Under its uniting phrase or slogan, Ireland can hopefully inspire Member States to support and implement a constructive “Made in Europe” vision."

Only EU-wide rules for ecolabels, public procurement, housing, construction and water resilience can guarantee that a product or technology proven in one Member State instantly gains access to the entire Single Market, turning national innovation into European demand. EU trade defence instruments combine the economic weight of all Member States, enabling Europe to confront unfair trade practices with a credibility and impact that individual countries, acting alone, simply do not have.

350,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/26fb2b4b/ITI__Information_Technology_Industry_Council_-_Submission_350.docx,ITI – Information Technology Industry Council,,,,5,"Ahead of Ireland’s upcoming Council Presidency, ITI urges Ireland to champion an ambitious agenda that supports technological innovation by strengthening Europe’s competitiveness, driving regulatory simplification, and preserving openness to global collaboration. The incoming Presidency will take office at a time of intensifying global competition, geopolitical uncertainty, and accelerating technological change. A fully functioning and integrated Single Market – supported by pro-innovation regulation and high rates of technology adoption – remains the essential foundation for Europe’s competitiveness, resilience, and long-term prosperity. While our detailed submission outlines specific recommendations across AI, data, cybersecurity, platforms, telecoms, sustainability, and standards, ITI recommends that the following three horizontal recommendations should guide Ireland’s approach to technology policy before and during its Presidency. First, ITI urges Ireland to continue the EU’s Competitiveness Agenda and ensure institutions consistently consider the impact of new and existing policies on Europe’s competitive conditions. Europe’s ability to compete globally depends on maintaining a policy and regulatory environment that enables innovation, investment, and technological leadership. Achieving the EU’s competitiveness goals and its Digital Decade targets will require not only simpler and more coherent rules but also solidifying the Single Market, making concerted efforts to attract and facilitate investments in new technologies like AI, ensuring access to affordable and reliable energy, and building the EU’s tech talent pool. Europe’s competitiveness will equally depend on boosting technology adoption – ensuring that businesses, institutions, and individuals across the EU can access and deploy cutting-edge digital tools. Second, ITI encourages Ireland to advance a robust simplification agenda, starting with the swift adoption of the Digital Omnibus Package and extending toward a more ambitious effort to streamline the EU digital rulebook. The EU's technology regulation has become increasingly dense, fragmented, and overlapping – spanning AI, cybersecurity, data, sustainability and sectoral rules. This complexity undermines legal certainty, slows commercial decision-making, and deters investment – which in turn has an impact on the EU’s competitiveness. The Digital Omnibus represents an important first step toward restoring clarity and predictability, and we urge Ireland to ensure its swift adoption – hopefully ahead of the start of the presidency. Beyond the Omnibus, greater ambition is needed for simplification of EU tech rules, particularly in relation to cybersecurity and data rules. ITI urges the Irish Presidency to support wider rationalization of overlapping legal obligations, including through the upcoming Digital Fitness Check, promote clearer and more consistent implementation across Member states, and strengthen coordination among enforcement authorities. Finally, ITI calls on Ireland to ensure that Europe’s pursuit of technological sovereignty remains rooted in openness, choice, and cooperation with trusted international partners. Sovereignty should be defined by functional capabilities that allow Europe to act independently when necessary – not by restrictive approaches that close markets or exclude trusted global technology providers. In areas such as AI, cloud, semiconductors, cybersecurity, and data, policies must avoid non-technical restrictions that fragment markets, limit access to cutting-edge solutions, or weaken resilience. Europe should instead adopt transparent, risk-based criteria that support collaboration with trusted global technology providers and ensure access to state-of-the-art technologies for European innovators and users."

As the consultation document notes, the Presidency should articulate a “people-centred and future-oriented vision for the EU”. The Irish Presidency should prioritise three high-level themes: 1. A Social and Connected Europe Across the EU, rural communities face declining services, depopulation and the erosion of essential social infrastructure. Pubs, cafés and small hospitality venues play an outsized role in combating isolation and sustaining local life. Ireland can lead in shaping an EU agenda that values social infrastructure as critical to wellbeing, cohesion and democratic resilience. Ireland should promote EU-wide frameworks encouraging Member States to protect and invest in rural and community assets, drawing on UK, French, Spanish and German policies that recognise pubs and social venues as essential “third places”. 2. A Fair, Competitive and Diverse Rural Economy Ireland should place rural SMEs, including hospitality, food, tourism and cultural enterprises, at the centre of EU discussions on competitiveness. EU policy often focuses on large-scale industry; rural microbusinesses need proportionate regulation, targeted supports, and easier access to EU funding. Ireland should promote policies that encourage entrepreneurship, digital transformation and local job creation, recognising that hospitality remains a major employer, particularly for young people and those with limited mobility."

Rural Services, Social Infrastructure and Community Spaces Ireland should encourage Council work on the European Commission’s rural development and cohesion programmes, with an emphasis on protecting social infrastructure. Other countries have acted, the UK’s “Pride in Place” programme, France’s rural licensing reforms, Spain’s subsidies for village bars and Germany’s “third place” funding all recognise the need to preserve social meeting spaces. Ireland can champion EU policy that acknowledges community venues (pubs, cafés, cultural spaces) as contributors to social cohesion and wellbeing. 2. SME Competitiveness, Proportionate Regulation & Hospitality Sector Support Hospitality SMEs account for millions of jobs across Europe. The EU’s SME Relief Package and REFIT initiatives should be advanced to ensure regulation is proportionate for small operators. Key issues include: reducing administrative burden, supporting digital transition, ensuring fair access to labour and skills programmes, strengthening EU funding streams for hospitality as part of the tourism ecosystem. 3. Rural Mobility and Transport Reliable late-evening rural mobility remains a major barrier to participation in social, cultural and economic life. Ireland should lead discussions on EU support for rural mobility pilots, smart-taxi solutions and digital transport innovations. 4. Green Transition for SMEs Ireland should prioritise negotiations on energy-efficiency legislation affecting small businesses, ensuring EU programmes provide financial support rather than simply compliance obligations. A specific focus should be placed on small hospitality venues that require capital support to invest in retrofitting, refrigeration efficiency and renewable power. 5. European Year of Community Spaces (proposed initiative) Ireland could propose that the EU designate a future year as the European Year of Community Spaces, highlighting policies to preserve rural and urban social infrastructure. This aligns with Ireland’s strengths and the EU’s cohesion objectives."

Three approaches would yield significant positive impact: 1. Make EU policy more relevant to rural citizens Ireland can highlight the everyday challenges facing rural communities: declining services, loss of social spaces, restricted mobility and rising operating costs for small businesses. By advocating for EU measures that protect and revitalise rural social infrastructure, as seen in other Member States’ policies, Ireland can champion an EU agenda that is felt in towns and villages, not just capitals. 2. Prioritise SMEs and community-level enterprises Hospitality, retail, tourism and cultural SMEs are major local employers. Council work on competitiveness, tourism, cohesion and social policy should explicitly integrate the needs of small service-sector businesses. Strengthening access to EU funds, simplifying regulatory requirements, and promoting workforce development will directly help communities across Europe. 3. Promote an EU framework for mobility, connectivity and community wellbeing Ireland can use the Council Presidency to emphasise practical measures that improve quality of life: better rural mobility solutions, digital innovation accessible to small businesses, community-centred regeneration, green-transition supports that are realistic for small operators. These measures support the EU’s commitment to cohesion and balanced development, ensuring no community is left behind. Across all configurations, Ireland can reinforce that a strong Union depends not only on its cities and industries but on the resilience of its rural and regional communities."

Ground EU policy in real community examples Citizens rarely associate the EU with local improvements. Ireland should highlight how EU funding affects everyday life: town-centre renewal, rural broadband, community venues, skills programmes, supports for SMEs and hospitality businesses. Case studies - including pubs that have benefited from EU-supported regeneration or training programmes - can illustrate the EU’s relevance. 2. Engage civil society and local businesses Publicans, small hospitality businesses, cultural venues and local volunteers often have strong community networks. Ireland should leverage these networks through: local events during the Presidency, EU “roadshows” in towns and villages, partnerships with SMEs to promote stories of EU impact. 3. Make the Presidency accessible Efforts should be made to demystify EU processes. Interactive digital content, plain-language summaries and community-level discussions will help. Highlighting the Presidency as a national achievement, reflecting Ireland’s diplomatic role and commitment to European values, will build pride and ownership."

Numerous countries, including France, Spain, Germany and Belgium, are now implementing policies to protect or revive local pubs, cafés and community spaces because they recognise the severe social impact of their decline. These international examples demonstrate a shift toward treating pubs and similar venues as community assets, not simply commercial entities. They play a vital role in tackling loneliness, sustaining rural economies, supporting tourism, and providing accessible employment. Ireland has the opportunity to bring this perspective into EU policy discussions during its Presidency. A European conversation on rural social infrastructure would be timely and impactful, aligning with the EU’s cohesion goals, rural development priorities and Green and Digital transitions. Ireland’s Presidency can help ensure that future EU policy recognises that vibrant communities require vibrant social spaces and that safeguarding these assets strengthens democracy and wellbeing throughout the Union."

Safeguarding the development mandate within the new Global Europe Instrument and MFF and ensuring that external funds will support partner countries and local CSOs over EU competitiveness and economic interests will be critical. Regulation of corporations with respect to human rights and the environment. Ireland should use the presidency to urge the EU to restore ambition in sustainability and human rights protections; reject deregulation disguised as simplification; defend democratic decision-making and resist undue corporate influence; reaffirm EU leadership in the global movement for integral ecology and social justice. The experience of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Omnibus I legislation should be treated as a cautionary tale as it involved: a sophisticated influencing campaign by a small number of US multinationals and business associations that contradicted the preferences of most EU businesses; an opaque and undemocratic process that the EU Ombudsperson declared ‘maladministration’; common cause between centre right and extremist groups in the European Parliament, obliterating the cordon sanitaire. This undemocratic and captured policymaking process must not become a model for future deregulatory measures, or it will result in loss of public faith in EU democracy, the enhanced power of extremists, deepened injustice and unsustainability. Ireland must correct the narrative around “competitiveness” and “simplification” and ensure that business interests do not continue to be prioritised over essential protections for workers, communities and the environment. Defending the Green Deal from further deregulation and capture by private interests, in line with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of European citizens as outlined in opinion polling. Climate justice and equity: Another key priority for the Irish Presidency should be the climate policy framework; in particular the definition of the post-2030 climate and energy policy architecture to deliver on the 90% net EU 2040 climate target, ensuring this architecture is environmentally robust, socially just, and upholds the EU’s obligations to the principles of equity and CBDR-RC. In the context of recent COP outcomes that have failed to address the glaring gap on climate action and ambition, it is essential that Ireland prioritises the upholding of international obligations including the principles of equity and CBDR-RC, and obligations as clarified by the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion July 2025, and ensure that the EU meaningfully commits to multilateralism to address the climate crisis with urgency and justice. Advancing Just Transitions to deliver on the COP30 outcome on Just Transition, including the elements related to building resilient food systems. Broader reforms of the international financial architecture will also be required. Championing the vital role of civil society – in particular Human Rights Defenders – in promoting democracy, protecting the environment and advancing human rights to the benefit of all, not narrow particularistic interests or profits."

The potential for projects to contribute to closing civic space, human rights and environmental abuses, increased debts and for prioritising private interests over human needs mean that a root-and-branch review of the strategy is required. Ireland should facilitate this process, which should involve civil society in Europe and project countries in decision-making. The EU-Israel Association Agreement: The EU must suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement, as well as ensuring appropriate accountability measures to be taken in light of the genocide, war crimes and human rights violations committed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory. Furthermore, in line with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of July 2024, a European trade ban is necessary to bring EU policy back into compliance with international law. Global Europe Instrument: The Global Europe Instrument should safeguard an ambitious budget. It is imperative that grant based funding is prioritised and aid conditionality is rejected, along with the rejection of provisions that would allow the ODA target to be adjusted during the course of the budget cycle. A clear and explicit reference to poverty reduction should be included, along with minimum funding levels for strategic investments, including humanitarian assistance. International legally binding instrument to regulate, in international human rights law, the activities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises: The EU should positively engage with the process to create a legally binding instrument at the UN and to adopt a position based on the primacy and protection of human rights and the environment. Ireland should model this approach by adopting its own public position as outlined in this briefing by the Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights. EU Climate Policy Architecture post-2030: Considering recent developments on the EU’s 2040 target are still below the EU’s fair share of climate action, key priorities should include the review of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 1, the post-2030 Effort Sharing Regulation, and the establishment of high-quality criteria for problematic international credits which could weaken EU climate ambition. Climate resilient food systems: Key priorities should include the UN Committee on World Food Security's process on Building Resilient Food Systems which will unfold throughout 2026. A further priority should be the development of an EU climate action, agriculture and food security position which recognises the imperative of addressing the agriculture climate finance gap and supports accessible grant-based actions for transformative agriculture and food systems, and which includes a formal decision to continue work on climate action on agriculture and food security post the Sharm el-Sheikh joint work programme, due to culminate at COP31. Civil Society Space: Establish a clear implementation plan for the EU’s Civil Society Strategy in collaboration with civil society. Via the EU’s External Actions, ramp up support for autonomous civil society via public funding and provide financial and technical supports to EU delegations to safeguard their important role."

Additionally, make clear commitments to democracy and demonstrate this commitment by prioritising issues that enjoy significant public support, including climate and environmental justice and holding corporations to account for abuses. Ireland should also seize the opportunity to highlight the importance of the principle of public funding for autonomous civil society, and to counter mis and dis information regarding civil society in Europe. At a time of EU member states looking increasingly inward, closing space for civil society, and increased fragmentation of society within Europe, we must strongly champion the critical role of civil society and support efforts to foster global solidarity. Ireland can also work to ensure that transparency measures are applied equally to all actors, including the for-profit sector, using a risk-based approach. Finally, Ireland can and should make clear that advocacy is a legitimate and indeed essential component of civil society and a valid use of funds. While delaying climate action will imply dramatic costs for society and the economy across the EU and within EU Member States, and this has been highlighted by the European Climate Risk Assessment, acting promptly and decisively will bring a wide range of benefits: following a more ambitious pathway, the EU could gain at least €1 trillion by 2030. Furthermore, this action is supported by society, the latest EU barometer confirmed that European citizens regard climate action as a key priority. During the Irish Presidency, the European Commission is expected to put forward the legislative proposals shaping the post-2030 climate and energy policy architecture. The Irish Presidency’s role will thus be key to make sure this work stream is prioritised by the Council and to make sure that these discussions include human rights, environmental integrity and just transition at the core of the policy framework. Science-based, equitable and socially just EU climate policy is essential to ensure societal wellbeing and a sustainable economy on a healthy planet, both in the EU and in the rest of the world. The Irish Presidency can play a decisive role by ensuring that Council discussions prioritise workers and communities affected by corporate harm, and those most vulnerable to climate breakdown and environmental degradation. A rights-centred Council agenda will help ensure that EU law offers protection for individuals negatively impacted by the activities of corporate actors."
433,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/47f4c538/Tr%C3%B3caire_-_Submission_433.docx,Trócaire,,,,4,"European democracy is facing a critical juncture. Data from the CIVCUS Monitor’s Global Findings found “a worsening environment” for civil society in the EU, with three prominent member states – France, Germany and Italy – all being downgraded from ‘narrowed’ to ‘obstructed’ civic space. According to the 2025 ITUC Global Rights Index, Europe has experienced the biggest decline in respect for fundamental rights and freedoms seen in any region in the past ten years. This situation is partly explained by the increasingly remote manner of governing, growing capture of decision-making processes by large corporations (at both EU and member state level, as highlighted by Irish media) and, in turn, a generalised failure to prioritise policy areas that enjoy significant public support, such as decisive climate action, or strong legislation to hold corporations to account. Civil society plays a vital role in safeguarding the public good. Unlike private actors that are mandated to maximise the particularistic interests of their shareholders, civil society represents the collective interests of citizens, advocating for human rights, social justice, environmental protection, and fair labour standards. As one of the EU member states that has protected an open civil society space, Ireland can and should use the presidency to democratise the presidency, both in terms of procedures - through enhanced dialogue with citizens and civil society, platforming those that defend human rights and the planet, sharing information publicly and trialling deliberative decision-making processes - and substance – by adopting a focus on policy action that reflects their desires and meets the true socio-economic and planetary challenges we face."
412,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9e69802b/Bolt_-_Submission_412.docx,Bolt,,,,1,"Ireland should champion policies that strengthen Europe’s global competitiveness in an era of rapid technological change. This requires two complementary priorities: deepening the Single Market as an enabler of innovation and growth, and boosting the EU tech ecosystem. Deepening the Single Market as an enabler of innovation and growth First, Ireland should prioritise the implementation of the EU’s 2025 Single Market strategy, including by proposing legislation that harmonizes rules for urban transport services. The Single Market remains the EU’s greatest asset. However, today, there is no Single Market for key sectors—such as ride-hailing, which is fragmented by national regulations and outdated taxi laws. While the EU has regulated platforms on labour and taxation, it has failed to create a functioning market for urban mobility services. Despite the Commission’s 2022 guidance, which recognises that challenges faced by the Private Hire Vehicles sector in the EU, such as the return-to-garage rules and mandatory waiting times. In 2023, the European Court of Justice also reaffirmed that national restrictions must be justified by overriding public interests and cannot amount to unjustified barriers to market access. Despite the guidance and the ECJ ruling, no legislative action has followed. Today, ride-hailing remains banned or severely restricted in nine Member States. This creates barriers that limit supply, raise costs, and stifle innovation. Removing these obstacles and enabling market-based pricing will expand supply, lower prices, and spur innovation—just as EU liberalisation did for aviation and rail. This is not just about ride-hailing, it is the foundation for Europe’s future mobility. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will scale first through ride-hailing platforms, but Europe cannot build a Single Market for AVs without fixing ride-hailing. A harmonized framework will accelerate AV deployment, reduce emissions, and make urban transport more efficient—supporting President von der Leyen’s ambition to make self-driving mobility a European success story. Harmonization is therefore critical for both today’s shared mobility and tomorrow’s autonomous transport ecosystem. Boosting the EU tech ecosystem Second, Ireland could help boost the EU tech ecosystem by advocating for a dedicated EU funding framework that supports the scale-up and commercial deployment of European tech champions—particularly in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and deep tech. Europe produces world-class innovators, yet they lack late-stage capital, raising ten times less than the U.S. and China. This funding gap leaves European companies vulnerable to acquisition or being outcompeted. Strategic EU investment is essential to turn promising startups into global leaders. AVs illustrate this urgency: the global AV market is projected to reach €400 billion by 2035, and ride-hailing will be the first major application. However, Europe still lacks a dedicated funding stream for deployment. EU support must move beyond fragmented research and pilots, focusing instead on de-risking high upfront costs and backing companies ready to scale commercially."
412,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9e69802b/Bolt_-_Submission_412.docx,Bolt,,,,2,"In line with the response provided to the first question, Ireland should prioritise delivering on the EU Single Market Strategy (2025) and the 2030 Consumer Agenda, ensuring these strategies translate into tangible outcomes. A key focus should be the creation of a Single Market for ride-hailing services, which remains fragmented. The 2025 Single Market Strategy envisages applying EU rules and principles to the taxi and private hire vehicle sector. The European Court of Justice’s 2023 ruling confirmed that national restrictions must be justified by overriding public interests and cannot amount to unjustified barriers to market access. Yet, no legislative action has followed, and ride-hailing remains banned or severely restricted in nine Member States. This regulatory fragmentation undermines mobility innovation and Europe’s competitiveness. The need to apply Single Market principles to taxi and private hire vehicle sector was also reiterated in the 2030 Consumer Agenda. Ireland should encourage the Commission to advance a legislative initiative aimed at harmonizing rules for urban transport services, fostering regulatory consistency, reducing unnecessary barriers, and supporting fair, market-driven pricing. This will unlock supply, lower costs, and accelerate innovation—critical for scaling autonomous vehicles (AVs), which will first deploy through ride-hailing. Without fixing ride-hailing, Europe cannot build a Single Market for AVs, jeopardizing President von der Leyen’s ambition of making self-driving mobility a European success story. Beyond mobility, Ireland should focus on: ο Simplification Package & Digital Fitness Check: ensure smooth adoption of the Digital Omnibus proposals and support the Digital Fitness Check the Commission plans to conduct in 2026. ο 28th Regime: advance discussions on optional harmonized frameworks to support cross-border business models. Having a dedicated regime for company law, taxation and insolvency can help create new EU companies. We are interested in what the 28th regime could mean EU scaleups - such as Bolt - who have reached a certain size. We need measures that help companies reach all 450 million European consumers. ο Corporate Fleets Proposal: the shift to zero-emission vehicles remains a major hurdle for professional drivers who face barriers such as limited urban charging infrastructure, high energy costs, and substantial upfront investment. Because these obstacles vary widely across EU Member States, imposing uniform electrification mandates on corporate fleets without considering these disparities could hinder progress and penalize certain actors, especially ride-hailing fleets with unique operational needs. To ensure shared mobility drives the green transition, Ireland should advance EU policies that focus on tailored incentives, infrastructure development, and realistic timelines rather than one-size-fits-all mandates."

I am framing my reply in terms of being a finance professor , an educationalist, and through my professional association with European financial adviser networks. My comments can be contextualised by reference to advancing the implementation of the recommendations of the EU Draghi report on ‘The Future of European Competitiveness- A Competitiveness Strategy for Europe’, published in 2024. Progress could be a lot faster on its implementation, in particular given the current international geopolitical environment. The Draghi Report key recommendations focus on closing the innovation and productivity gaps with other global competitors by simplifying the regulatory burden, unlocking private capital through a deeper capital markets union and savings and investment union, and aligning the green agenda and digitalisation with competitiveness and innovation and simplifying the extant rules in relation to securitisation. These recommendations are mutually interdependent and complementary. For instance, as a practical example, deeper and more integrated capital markets could act as an effective financing mechanism for green and sustainable initiatives (with a greater number of these initiatives unlocked through simplifying the ‘technical taxonomies’ associated with the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts). My concern is though there are initiatives taking place associated with these themes the pace of implementation is too slow and should be rapidly accelerated. As Ireland does not take its role up until mid-2026 there may be a pressing need to be very proactive if there are delays in implementation in the first half of 2026."

Deepen Capital Markets Union (CMU) by reducing the barriers to integrating European capital markets: This is critical, inter alia, for scale and breadth in venture capital funds Lead in creating a Savings and Investments Union (SIU), making capital markets more accessible to channel private sector investment (institutional and retail) in key areas like digital and green initiatives, whilst simultaneously expanding the range and depth of European portfolio pension fund investment opportunities. This will require better supervisory convergence in relation to MiFID 2, MiFIR, EMIR and the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). (These are some of the items on the agenda of ESMA but they need to move faster). Relatedly, from an educational perspective momentum needs to be sustained in terms of the EU’s new strategy on financial literacy focusing on co-ordination and sharing best practices across Member States. Boost digitalization, including digital sovereignty by addressing the lack of digitalization as a primary reason for lower productivity compared to other global blocs. This would include accelerating, inter alia, the proposed and anticipated Cloud and AI Development Act, the Quantum Act, and the Innovation Act. These will provide support of capital markets and VC and private equity funding for emerging and innovative technologies. From an educational perspective, parallel comments to my comments on financial literacy can be made in terms of the implementation of the Digital Literacy Action Plan (DEAP) which is currently forecast to fall short of its target of having 80% of adults with basic digital skills by 2030. In relation to venture capital, momentum needs to be sustained in the enactment of changes to the European Venture Capital Funds Regulation to make to easier for venture capital funds to invest on a pan-European basis. Align the green transition with competitiveness by simplifying the climate change and environmental taxonomies, hence expanding the range and depth of investment opportunities associated with the green transition, as some sectors (such as agriculture) and firms (based on size) are currently not formally in scope. There are current EU consultations on these technical taxonomies, but effective speedy implementation actions need to take place."

We note that the Roadmap also states that, as part of the 2026 revision of public procurement directives, the Commission will: “explore how to better promote socially responsible public procurement, including the wider use of the Best Price Quality Ratio and of collective bargaining”. Unite represents construction workers throughout Ireland and we regularly encounter employers in receipt of significant public contracts who disregard workers’ rights and engage in anti-union activity. It is Unite’s view that a successful Irish presidency must lead by example. In order to effectively promote the Quality Jobs Roadmap and Act, with its welcome focus on collective bargaining, the Irish government must fully transpose the EU Directive on Adequate Minimum Wages by enacting legislation providing for the right of workers to bargain collectively through the trade union of their choice. Just Transition and Climate Change Europe is a major contributor to global warming and is also the fastest-warming continent Workers are paying the price for climate change not only in terms of necessary decarbonisation and its impacts on employment and living costs, but also resulting from the increasing incidence and severity of heatwaves, storms, floods and other extreme weather events. Ireland supports the call by the European Trade Union Confederation for a European Just Transition Directive. We also urge the Irish presidency to push for a review of relevant Occupational Safety and Health Directives to ensure that workers’ health, safety and incomes are protected during and after extreme weather events, and for a new Directive on preventing occupational heat risks. Unite’s proposals are available here. EU Anti-Poverty Strategy Unite urges the Irish presidency to drive forward the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, which cleared its first European Parliament vote in December. In addition to measures to end in-work poverty by ensuring wage increases, higher statutory minimum wages and stronger collective bargaining, the Strategy should include an EU Minimum Income Directive, a Child Guarantee for children most in need, a ban on no-fault evictions, action to end child homelessness and investment in affordable childcare and early education.

The new Directive should: Ensure that public money goes to companies that respect workers’ rights, negotiate with trade unions and are covered by collective agreements; Eliminate ‘price-only’ contract awards; Ensure supply chain accountability and limit sub-contracting chains; Ensure that in-house provision of public services is not undermined. Housing in line with Principle 19 (housing and assistance for the homeless) of the European pillar of social rights, and with the cohesion policy objectives 2021-2027, the EU Affordable Housing Plan due to be announced at the end of 2025 must be progressed by the Irish presidency with a focus on increasing social and not-for-profit housing while safeguarding the terms and conditions of the workers delivering the housing. Gender Equality The Irish presidency should progress the 2026-2030 Gender Equality Strategy due to be announced in early 2026 with particular regard to action on gender-based violence and ensuring full access to reproductive healthcare throughout the EU. [Continues on next page] (4) Vindicating migrant workers’ rights Migrant workers in Ireland, as well as Irish nationals of minority ethnicities, are exposed to increased hostility and racism as a consequence of longstanding national policy failures in a range of areas, from housing to healthcare. By improving the rights, working and living conditions of all those working in the EU, regardless of origin, EU policy can help push-back against those attempting to stoke division. EU policy in respect of labour migration must promote decent work, equal treatment and inclusion. It must also protect migrant workers from exploitation and abuse. Unite notes that repressive immigration policies may drive precarious work, irregular forms of employment and exploitation. In this regard Unite would urge the Irish presidency to push for a Directive on subcontracting and labour intermediaries. We would also urge that the mandate of the European Labour Authority be extended to include seasonal workers and violations of the EU Anti-Trafficking Directive. [413 words]"

Robust collective bargaining provisions together with workplace democracy and worker participation, are key to an innovative productive economy, whether at national or EU level, and can help insulate European economies from external shocks – a point reinforced by the Council Recommendation of 12 June 2023 on strengthening social dialogue in the European Union, which noted that economies with wide collective bargaining coverage are more resilient and competitive. The right to bargain collectively is a central tenet of the European Union, enshrined in Article 28 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights. We note that the benefits of collective bargaining are explicitly recognized in the texts of a number of Directives, most recently the Directive on Adequate Minimum Wages and the Pay Transparency Directive, and that the EU’s commitment to workers’ right, the role of trade unions and collective bargaining was restated in the 2024 La Hulpe Declaration, notwithstanding the Irish government’s regrettable statement restating the ‘voluntarist’ nature of the Irish industrial relations system.

Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. . A R e s i l i e n t an d P r e p a r e d E u r o p e The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. . A P e o p l e -C e n t r e d U n i o n t h a t P r o t e c t s Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind.

Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: •Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. •Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: •Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (non legislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally.

Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. • Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. • More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities.

Despite EU Policy outlining the importance of coherence across instruments, implementation is inconsistent across protracted crises contexts, restricting the potential for complementary support to Education, to ensure the best outcomes for children and learners. Second, we welcome INTPA’s commitments to education and the 10% ringfencing of the humanitarian budget for Education in Emergencies (EiE), but note concerns about the continuation of this commitment. The Presidency will offer two key opportunities to reinforce this commitment: 1. The renewal of the Non-Legislative Communication on Humanitarian Aid, with Council conclusions and a possible resolution from the European Parliament on the Communication likely to occur during Ireland’s presidency. It is integral that education is integrated into the broader resilience-building strategies and supported through flexible, multisectoral financing. 2. Ireland will also have an opportunity to ensure prioritisation of the development and the humanitarian aid and resilience components in the negotiation on the 2028−2034 multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the introduction of the Global Europe instrument. It is critical to secure a commitment to maintain adequate education funding across both development and humanitarian budgets beyond 2027, including continuing the 10% of humanitarian budget for Education in Emergencies (EiE) and committing to ringfencing adequate funding for Education across INTPA and other instruments. Third, the Presidency should support measures to address the global teacher crisis, including prioritising teacher wellbeing, fair salaries, manageable workloads, and structured career development. This can only be achieved by ensuring that education-focused NGOs and trade unions are actively included in policy dialogue. Education in EU Climate Policy, Financing, and Cooperation Our members stress the need to integrate education into all relevant EU climate policy processes and long-term strategies, particularly in development cooperation and humanitarian responses to climate crises worldwide. Efforts should prioritise protecting learning from climate shocks and recognising education as a key driver of climate awareness, mitigation, and adaption in EU foreign policy approaches. Climate financing must explicitly support education, addressing both immediate and long-term needs. EU Investing in Global Citizenship Education A priority for the EU Presidency must be to invest in and strengthen Global Citizenship Education (GCE) both within and outside the EU, securing investment within the 2028−2034 multiannual financial framework (MFF). GCE is at the core of helping people understand the root causes of injustice and inequality, engage with complex global challenges—such as crises, climate change, and threats to democratic values — and appreciate why the EU and governments investments in development, humanitarian aid, and the SDGs, including education, are essential. Strengthening GCE is critical to fostering informed, engaged citizens who support multilevel and multilateral approaches to global challenges. Shaping EU Positions in UN Negotiations on the Right to Free Education and a Fair Global Financing 1. Negotiations on a new Optional Protocol to the UNCRC on Free Education: For millions of children around the world, the cost of education remains one of the most significant barriers to education. While nearly 90% of children complete primary education, only 59% complete secondary education, and only half of pre-primary aged children attend preschool with the youngest children (under age of three) having almost no access to high-quality early childhood care and education. The Irish EU Presidency should use its leadership to ensure that EU positions in UN negotiations actively support the initiative at the United Nations Human Rights Council to adopt a new optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, strengthening the right to free education under international law. This new addition would address a gap left by the convention, which guarantees all children a right to free primary education, but says nothing about early childhood education or pre-primary education, and does not require governments to make secondary education free for all children. A particularly important opporunity, will be the Second Intergovernmental Working Group meeting on the protocol in August/September 2026. 2. Fair Financing Architecture and the UN Tax Convention Development, humanitarian, and climate financing are important, but insufficient to achieve SDG 4. The world urgently needs a fairer and more sustainable financing architecture that guarantees adequate funding for public services, including education. Through its EU Presidency, Ireland must ensure that the EU supports meaningful global reforms, including the development of an impactful UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, which should explicitly include a UN Global Asset Register and provisions linking tax policies to financing for quality public education, to secure predictable, equitable, and rights-based funding."

These values are non-negotiable and must find a confident, principled, and vocal champion in the Irish EU Presidency, ready to defend and to advance them.

As such, Sky urges Ireland to focus its Presidency on a competitive and culturally strong digital Europe, where possible prioritising enforcement over new regulation: deliver binding anti-piracy measures for live content, implement AI rules that protect copyright, maintain territoriality and AVMSD stability, and - ensure fair treatment of regulated media. Through this. Europe can safeguard investment, pluralism and consumer trust. In parallel, Ireland should uphold the fundamentals of the EU telecom framework—SMP rules and ex-ante regulation—to keep networks open and competitive, resist blanket deregulation that favours incumbents, and reject any proposals for network fees or mandatory dispute-resolution mechanisms that would undermine the Open Internet and consumer choice."
471,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ad024fc9/Sky_-_Submission_471.docx,Sky,Business,Telecommunications and media,,2,"(1) Digital Networks Act Maintaining the fundamentals of the existing regulatory framework(SMP rules and ex-ante approach) is key to ensure the electronic communications sector in Europe remains open, fair and competitive. Attempts to ‘simplify’ by substantially deregulating in favour of incumbents would be to the detriment of the sector’s competitiveness and consumers’ choice. The current framework already provides national regulators with enough flexibility to deregulate where necessary. We would also caution against the introduction of dispute resolution mechanisms and/or payment of fees between content providers and internet services, as this would be unjustified (as BEREC itself proved repeatedly) and would risk impacting the stability of the Open Internet and of the interconnection market. Most importantly, this would also negatively impact consumer choice and prices. We would also encourage continued support from the Irish Presidency towards the work of BEREC in ensuring legal guidance for businesses and a consistent implementation of European rules. Consumer protection Were the Digital Fairness Act be published during the Irish Presidency, we would caution against a onesize-fits-all approach for businesses across sectors when it comes to issues such as ‘addictive designs’, ‘subscription traps’ and ‘dark patterns’. The audiovisual and electronic communications sectors are already heavily regulated around the issues identified by the European Commission – often way beyond already existing horizontal consumer protection rules. There is no evidence that audiovisual services are problematic or harmful for consumers. Anti-piracy Move from soft law to hard law against live piracy: near-immediate takedown (≤30 minutes), dynamic blocking (including IP blocking) in all Member States, and robust Know-Your-Customer obligations across intermediaries. Non-binding approaches have shown minimal impact while organised criminal networks continue to exploit gaps. Audiovisual Media Services Directive Prioritise a stable, flexible framework for audiovisual services that supports investment and scale, avoids reopening AVMSD for new quotas/levies, and preserves contractual freedom in IP allocation. Keep country-of-origin; support principles-based guidance on prominence; resist prescriptive, harmonised solutions that add burden and reduce investment. Stability and flexibility are essential for broadcasters and VOD services to invest, adapt and serve audiences. Artificial Intelligence Support trustworthy AI that respects copyright and creativity. Operationalise the AI Act with enforceable transparency on training data, EU-level voluntary licensing tools for rightsholders, and clear responsibility on AI developers—not rightsholders—for copyright breaches."

Across the EU, citizens are already experiencing the consequences of climate change, biodiversity collapse, pollution and unstable supply chains. Communities affected by storms, flooding and environmental degradation continue to demonstrate solidarity, adaptability and creativity. These experiences show that resilience emerges from strong ecosystems, empowered communities and effective public institutions working together. Ireland’s Presidency can therefore provide leadership by advancing a positive, future-oriented programme grounded in three mutually reinforcing priorities. 1. Environmental and Ecological Resilience Healthy ecosystems underpin climate stability, food security, water quality and economic prosperity. Strengthening environmental resilience should therefore be a core priority of the Presidency. Ireland should champion full implementation of the European Green Deal, including nature restoration, clean water, zero-pollution objectives, climate adaptation and biodiversity protection. A resilient Europe requires robust environmental law, grounded in scientific evidence and applied consistently across Member States. As political pressure grows to weaken EU environmental rules, Ireland can lead by ensuring that regulatory “simplification” enhances clarity and enforceability rather than reducing environmental safeguards. A Presidency focused on ecological resilience also provides an opportunity to embed nature-based solutions, sustainable land-use planning, climate-proofed infrastructure and long-term adaptation across all sectors. This reflects the growing recognition that environmental protection is central to societal and economic security. 2. Democratic, Community and Territorial Resilience Environmental resilience depends on strong democracies, engaged citizens and transparent decision-making. Communities must be supported to participate meaningfully in shaping the transitions affecting them. Ireland should use its Presidency to strengthen public access to environmental information, participation and justice, in line with the Aarhus Convention. Protecting civic space, supporting environmental defenders and ensuring open governance across the EU are essential for building trust and enabling fair, science-based decision-making. A community-centred approach also requires recognising the crucial role of local and regional authorities in delivering climate action, nature protection, spatial planning, sustainable mobility and place-based development. Strengthening multi-level governance and territorial cohesion will improve environmental outcomes, support healthy placemaking and reinforce democratic legitimacy. 3. Economic and Just Transition Resilience A resilient Europe requires a fair, well-funded and legally certain transition to a sustainable economy. The Presidency should support adequate EU funding for climate action, biodiversity restoration, rural development, innovation, skills and community-led transition. Rather than deregulation, Europe’s businesses and communities need predictable, science-based rules that support innovation, competitiveness and long-term planning. Ireland can play a leadership role in ensuring the next Multiannual Financial Framework and EU packages—such as the Circular Economy Act and the 2040 climate framework—maintain environmental integrity while delivering visible benefits for people. A Just Transition focused on fairness, participation, regional opportunity and community wellbeing will strengthen Europe’s social fabric and economic stability."
397,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e249d15e/Individual_submission_-_Submission_397.docx,,Individual,"Environment, Sustainability","National, EU-wide, global",2,"FIE propose a particular focus on the following policy and legislative areas and outcomes: Simplification must reinforce, not weaken, EU standards The Commission’s current focus on simplifying EU regulation presents a genuine opportunity to improve clarity, accessibility and administrative efficiency. As recognised in EU Treaties and recent jurisprudence, however, simplification must remain entirely consistent with the Union’s obligations under Articles 3(3) TEU, 11 and 191 TFEU, and Article 37 of the Charter to ensure a high level of environmental protection and continuous improvement. Any reform must therefore maintain or strengthen environmental integrity and legal certainty. Regulatory certainty supports innovation and competitiveness Clear, evidence-based standards benefit responsible businesses, investors and citizens. While some actors use the political moment to advocate broad deregulation, EU institutions and experts continue to underline that weakening standards increases uncertainty, rewards laggards and penalises those already investing in the transition. Judicial findings across Europe also show that vague or diluted criteria lead to inconsistent and often unlawful decision-making. Simplification should therefore enhance the clarity, enforceability and scientific grounding of rules rather than dilute them. A leadership opportunity for the Irish Presidency The Irish Presidency has both a responsibility and an opportunity to uphold the EU’s tradition of forward-looking, high-quality standard-setting. By supporting simplification that improves usability while preserving environmental integrity, Ireland can help safeguard public trust, provide regulatory certainty for businesses, and reinforce the EU’s long-term sustainability and competitiveness. A future-proof Multiannual Financial Framework The next MFF must ensure adequate, dedicated funding to meet existing legal obligations and societal needs. This includes: Nature restoration, delivered in partnership with farmers, communities and environmental stakeholders; Economically, socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture, including fully funded rural development programmes; Active citizenship and civil society, including continued support for LIFE, recognising the value of public participation affirmed in recent ECtHR jurisprudence These investments enhance resilience, compliance and community-led transition. Circular Economy Act: Practical benefits for people and business A well-designed Circular Economy Act can deliver visible gains: reducing built-in obsolescence, strengthening the right to repair, enhancing supply chain security, and supporting more sustainable resource use. Clear, measurable, science-based criteria—aligned with existing EU law—will help ensure the Act drives innovation and consumer confidence. 2040 Climate Package: Continuity, clarity and fairness The 2040 climate framework will shape Europe’s pathway to climate neutrality. Consistent with recent rulings such as Klimaseniorinnen, EU climate governance must rely on quantified pathways, timely action and structured engagement with scientific evidence. The package should therefore preserve the integrity of the existing regime, avoid creating new loopholes, and deliver a fair, transparent transition that addresses citizens’ material concerns—both legally and socially essential."

This requires embedding the principles of subsidiarity, territorial cohesion, environmental resilience, and democratic participation across the Council’s work. When local and regional actors are involved early and meaningfully, EU policy becomes more effective, better implemented, and more trusted. A priority should be strengthening multi-level governance. Local and regional authorities are central to delivering the EU’s climate, biodiversity, spatial planning, mobility, water, housing, and public service objectives. The Presidency can champion their systematic involvement in shaping national and EU positions, ensuring that territorial expertise informs negotiations. This would help produce legislation that is practical, proportionate, implementable and responsive to different regional starting points. Supporting structured dialogue with civil society, social partners, community organisations and business networks will further embed democratic legitimacy and improve policy outcomes. The Presidency also has an opportunity to reinforce environmental and ecological resilience as foundations of long-term wellbeing and economic stability. Council processes should uphold the EU’s high environmental standards and avoid any dilution that would undermine public health, biodiversity, climate mitigation or adaptation. Clear, science-based and enforceable rules provide regulatory certainty—benefiting responsible businesses, investors and communities—and support a fair and competitive internal market. Embedding environmental integrity across all Council work will help safeguard water resources, restore nature, improve air quality and strengthen Europe’s ability to withstand growing climate risks. A third area of impact is advancing a fair, well-funded and legally predictable transition. The Presidency should work to secure an ambitious Multiannual Financial Framework that provides sufficient resources for climate action, nature restoration, sustainable agriculture, regional development, innovation, skills and community-led transition. Adequate, targeted funding enhances resilience, supports competitiveness, and ensures that no region or community is left behind as Europe accelerates towards climate neutrality. The Presidency can also add value by promoting coherence across EU initiatives—particularly the Circular Economy Act and the 2040 climate framework—to ensure they reinforce rather than undermine one another. This means championing policies that reduce waste, strengthen the right to repair, enhance supply chain resilience, and deliver climate action in a way that is fair, transparent and attentive to people’s material concerns. Finally, the work of the Council can make a major difference by reinforcing open governance, transparency and access to information. Ensuring strong public rights to participation and justice strengthens trust, supports evidence-based decisions, and empowers communities to play an active role in shaping Europe’s future. By combining territorial expertise, strong environmental governance, subsidiarity, and a fair transition, the Irish Presidency can help deliver EU policies that produce meaningful, lasting benefits for people, businesses and communities across all regions."
397,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e249d15e/Individual_submission_-_Submission_397.docx,,Individual,"Environment, Sustainability","National, EU-wide, global",4,"The most effective way to communicate the values and benefits of EU membership is to demonstrate how EU law and policy have already tangibly improved life in Ireland and other countries. The upcoming Presidency should highlight concrete, relatable examples that show the EU as a practical force for cleaner environments, stronger rights, and healthier communities. Environmental protection offers some of the clearest examples. EU nature legislation has transformed how Ireland safeguards its bogs, woodlands and coastlines, protecting landscapes that are central to national identity. The Birds and Habitats Directives have created binding duties to protect important species and habitats, resulting in stronger oversight, clearer standards, and greater accountability when environmental rules are not followed. The new Nature Restoration Law goes further by requiring the active repair of damaged ecosystems, offering long-term benefits for biodiversity, climate resilience, and community well-being. Another significant achievement is the improvement of water quality. EU water and marine laws have raised expectations for Ireland’s rivers, lakes and coastal waters, driving investment in wastewater treatment and requiring action on pollution sources. These directives have helped revive rivers, make beaches safer, and protect drinking water, ensuring that environmental quality is not a luxury but a legal right. EU planning rules have also empowered people and communities. Requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) ensure that major projects are properly evaluated before they proceed. These rules embed sustainability into infrastructure and land-use decisions and guarantee public participation, with courts reinforcing that communities must be meaningfully heard. This helps citizens understand that the EU is not distant—it is shaping decisions that affect towns, housing, transport and local environments directly. Equally important is the EU’s role in promoting transparency. The Access to Information on the Environment Directive enables anyone to request environmental information from public bodies. This right has strengthened accountability, supported investigative journalism, and empowered communities to identify environmental issues, challenge poor decision-making, and demand better outcomes. It exemplifies the EU’s commitment to openness and democratic participation. The EU has also driven major improvements in waste management. Past shortcomings in Ireland’s waste and landfill practices were addressed only after EU intervention, resulting in stricter regulations, safer waste handling and cleaner communities. This demonstrates that EU enforcement can turn local concerns into national progress, making visible improvements in environmental quality and public health. Communicating these successes should rely on accessible storytelling, not technical language. Using real locations, communities, and stories will show that EU action has shaped Ireland’s natural environment, public services and democratic rights. Citizen ownership can be deepened through regional events, workshops, school and university engagements, cultural initiatives, and public dialogues that invite people to participate in shaping Ireland’s Presidency priorities. Ultimately, the message should be simple: EU membership has delivered cleaner water, protected nature, strengthened public rights, improved planning, and supported transparency. Ireland’s Presidency is an opportunity to highlight these achievements and involve citizens directly in shaping the next chapter of Ireland’s place in Europe."
397,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e249d15e/Individual_submission_-_Submission_397.docx,,Individual,"Environment, Sustainability","National, EU-wide, global",5,"As Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026, we must strengthen domestic compliance and governance with EU environmental law. Ireland is currently subject to a significant number of infringement proceedings for failures to fully transpose, implement, or enforce EU directives. These include active referrals to the Court of Justice concerning wastewater treatment obligations, delays in revising river basin and flood risk management plans, and insufficient protection of priority habitats. Additional proceedings remain ongoing in areas such as renewable energy permitting, environmental assessment, nature conservation, and water pollution control. The scale and persistence of these actions highlight structural shortcomings that require urgent and coordinated attention. A Member State entrusted with chairing the Council’s legislative work must demonstrate adherence to the Union’s legal framework. Effective stewardship depends on credibility: a Presidency that guides negotiations on climate, nature restoration, pollution prevention, and circular-economy measures must be seen as upholding these same standards at home. Continued non-compliance risks undermine Ireland’s influence, erode trust in environmental governance, and expose the State to financial penalties and reputational harm. Strengthening compliance should therefore be considered an integral component of Ireland’s Presidency preparation. Key actions include reinforcing administrative capacity within departments and regulatory bodies; improving coordination with local authorities responsible for implementation; ensuring transposition processes are timely, complete and scientifically robust; and embedding transparency, public participation and access to justice, consistent with the Aarhus Convention. Many of Ireland’s current infringements reflect delays, inconsistent application of standards, or gaps in monitoring and enforcement—issues that can be effectively addressed through clearer governance structures, proactive planning and adequate resourcing. Enhanced compliance will also produce tangible benefits for communities, businesses and the environment. Full and consistent implementation of EU environmental law supports cleaner water, healthier ecosystems, climate resilience, and a predictable and fair regulatory environment. It reduces long-term public expenditure by preventing environmental degradation, protecting health, and avoiding litigation. Moreover, a coherent compliance framework underpins a just transition by ensuring that environmental rules apply equally and transparently across sectors and regions. As Ireland enters a period of heightened responsibility within the EU, demonstrating leadership through strong domestic governance is both necessary and advantageous. By resolving long-standing infringements, improving enforcement systems, and ensuring that environmental decisions are grounded in clear evidence and meaningful public participation, Ireland can show its commitment to the Union’s values and reinforce the legitimacy of its Presidency. The 2026 Presidency will offer Ireland a critical platform to highlight the benefits of ambitious, enforceable environmental standards and to advance resilient, science-based policymaking across the Union. To use that platform effectively, Ireland must ensure its implementation framework fully aligns with EU law and meets a high standard of environmental protection. Strengthening domestic compliance is therefore essential to the credibility, authority, and success of the Irish Presidency."

The Rural Pact, launched by the EU Commission in 2021, as part of its Long-Term Vision for EU’s rural areas, provides a framework for cooperation between public authorities, civil society, businesses, academia and citizens, at the European, national, regional and local level. It aims at fostering mutual inspiration between all levels of governance and mobilise public authorities and stakeholders to act on the needs and aspirations of rural residents and rural matters. The Presidency offers a unique opportunity to ensure EU policy better reflects the needs of those living in rural communities, beyond agriculture, who continue to face structural disadvantages in accessing services, employment, infrastructure, and climate-transition support. While security, defence, and competitiveness are currently high on the EU agenda, they must not come at the expense of social cohesion, civil society, or the support provided to community and voluntary organisations that work with marginalised people and hard-to-reach communities. Rural communities across Europe, and in Ireland in particular, also play a vital role in ensuring both energy and food security. Rural households face higher living and transport costs, limited access to health and social services, and growing pressure from inflation. Many older people, low-income families, and isolated communities are particularly vulnerable. As Ireland is still a very rural country, it should champion an EU commitment to equitable access to services, enhanced social protection, and targeted supports for disadvantaged rural regions. A specific strand of the Presidency could highlight rural proofing of EU social policy to ensure no person or community in rural areas is left behind. A core priority should be to advance rural infrastructure and connectivity across Europe. Rural prosperity requires affordable housing, high-quality broadband, reliable public transport, and access to key services such as health, education, childcare, and community supports. Many rural areas still lack adequate digital connectivity and public transport options, leading to exclusion and depopulation. The Presidency should push for the EU to prioritise investment in rural digital and transport infrastructure, support the revitalisation of rural towns and villages, and encourage sustainable, community-based service provision. Ireland’s Presidency is a way to champion the 'right to stay' in rural areas. This gives citizens the ability to live and work in the community they call home. Given Ireland’s history of leading rural development practices and processes in Europe, and that we are one of the few countries in Europe with a dedicated Ministry for Rural Development and a rural development policy – Our Rural Future. It is an opportunity for Ireland to promote rural communities and the many benefits of living and working in rural areas."
337,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ee90fe5d/Irish_Rural_Link_-_Submission_337.docx,Irish Rural Link,,,,2,"IRL and the School of Agriculture, UCD believe that Ireland’s EU Presidency should champion policy priorities that strengthen rural communities, promote balanced regional development, and ensure that EU legislation supports a fair, sustainable and inclusive rural future. The Presidency offers a key opportunity to shape EU social, economic and environmental policymaking at a critical moment for rural areas across Europe. A central priority should be advancing social inclusion, improving access to essential services and embedding rural proofing across EU policy. This includes driving implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, addressing persistent service deficits in rural and remote areas, and tackling poverty and cost-of-living pressures. Digital inclusion must also remain at the core of EU social policy. Ireland should work to strengthen requirements for rural proofing within major EU social and economic initiatives, progress legislation that guarantees universal access to public services, both in-person and digitally, and promote minimum service standards across all Member States. The Presidency should place rural equality at the centre of EU social policy, committing the EU to better regional and rural impact assessments and enhanced investment in rural public services, transport and digital infrastructure. Improving rural infrastructure, mobility and connectivity is essential to enabling full participation in economic and social life. Key areas for action include implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), progress towards the EU Digital Decade 2030 targets, and ongoing reforms within EU Cohesion and Regional Policy. The Presidency should prioritise more flexible cohesion-funding rules to support small-scale rural infrastructure projects. Ireland should also highlight the importance of rural mobility solutions, community-based transport initiatives and digital deployment mechanisms that benefit rural towns, islands and remote regions. The Multi Financial Framework and CAP Post 2027 – must ensure that sustainable agriculture, food systems and the Just Transition continue to be funded and Ireland’s Presidency should work to ensure that EU legislation supports food security, viable farm incomes and effective climate and biodiversity action. This includes engaging actively with CAP Strategic Plan reforms, Farm-to-Fork and biodiversity legislation, and transition mechanisms affecting agriculture, energy and land use. Priority actions should include protecting small and family farms in any CAP revision through simplified schemes and fairer payments, alongside promoting workable, community-centred nature restoration and climateadaptation measures. The Presidency should aim for balanced policy outcomes that support farming livelihoods while advancing environmental commitments, ensuring fairness, flexibility and meaningful rural community involvement. LEADER is recognised as a valuable mechanism for supporting communities, the environment, and enterprises in rural areas. It should remain a core element of the CAP post-2027, and the Irish Presidency can help reinforce the importance of LEADER in promoting rural development and social inclusion. Improving rural participation and democratic engagement should be a cross-cutting priority. Ireland should promote stronger mechanisms for rural involvement in EU decision-making, including through the Rural Pact, local development structures and improved civil-society participation channels."

To achieve the greatest impact, the Presidency should encourage stronger social cohesion, sustainable economic opportunity, fair climate action and improved access to essential services. These priorities both reflect Ireland’s strengths and respond to the needs of rural communities across Europe. The gap between urban and rural areas remains a challenge in EU member states. Many people living in rural areas still face barriers in accessing healthcare, childcare, education, broadband and social supports. The Irish Presidency can use this opportunity to advance regional balance and rural equality, embed rural proofing across EU legislation, expand access to public services, both in-person and digitally, and strengthen social protection systems that reflect the higher costs of rural living. It should also promote measures to combat social isolation among older people, people with a disability, migrants, low-income households and remote communities. Improved connectivity is essential for employment, education, mobility and business development. The Presidency can accelerate progress on high-speed broadband for underserved regions, ensure fair and flexible implementation of transport networks, and expand investment tools suited to the needs of small towns, villages and islands. By prioritising practical, community-focused infrastructure, the Irish Presidency can help unlock economic potential, reduce regional disparities and make rural areas more attractive places to live and work. Sustainable rural economies depend on thriving small businesses, farms, social enterprises and community organisations. The Irish Presidency can strengthen these sectors by promoting simplified EU funding and regulatory requirements for SMEs and micro-enterprises, supporting community-led local development models such as LEADER, and fostering rural entrepreneurial ecosystems that include remote-working hubs, innovation supports and circular-economy initiatives. Policies that enhance food security and protect the viability of small family farms will further contribute to stable jobs, resilient supply chains and vibrant communities. Climate and biodiversity policy has a deep impact on rural regions, and many communities feel insufficiently supported as they try to make the necessary changes. Ireland can play a leadership role by prioritising a Just Transition that protects rural livelihoods, advancing climate measures co-designed and co-implemented with communities, and promoting pragmatic nature-restoration and land-use policies that balance environmental goals with local realities. A fairer transition will build public trust, support farmers and rural workers, and ensure environmental progress benefits all in society. Strengthening democratic participation is essential to effective policymaking. The Presidency can deepen citizen engagement by supporting strong civil-society involvement, by engaging with existing networks; C&V Pillar, CAP Network, PPN, EESC and the EU, while improving mechanisms that allow local communities, young people and marginalised groups to shape EU policy. Encouraging cross-border cooperation and knowledge-sharing among rural regions will further enhance inclusion and innovation. By leading with fairness, rural inclusion, sustainable development and community participation, Ireland’s Presidency can deliver lasting positive outcomes for people, businesses and communities across the EU."

Communication in advance and during the Presidency must be transparent, inclusive and rooted in everyday realities, particularly for rural communities that often feel distant from EU institutions. The Presidency offers a unique opportunity to bring Europe closer to people by making EU impacts visible, accessible and meaningful. With the new President of EESC, Seamus Boland, being Irish, it is also a good opportunity to bring civil society closer to the EU. A core priority should be showing how EU policies deliver tangible benefits at local level. People engage more when they can see results within their own communities. Communication should highlight EUfunded rural and social projects and initiatives; broadband delivery, community centres, transport improvements, LEADER initiatives, Just Transition, environmental restoration and supports for small businesses and farms. Sharing personal stories from those whose jobs, training, services or family farms have been strengthened by EU policies and funding, gives a better understanding of the work of the EU and demonstrate its value. Clear explanations of how EU rules protect consumers, workers, small producers and the environment further strengthen trust. Reaching every region requires using the existing strength of community networks. Organisations like IRL, CAP Network, PPNs, local development groups, youth services, libraries and community and voluntary organisations are trusted at the local level, especially in remote areas. Working with these networks, the Government can facilitate community information events and targeted outreach using rural communication channels, not just national media. Trusted local voices help ensure that Presidency themes and EU opportunities reach older residents, low-income households and those without strong digital access. Communication must be clear and concise, using plain English and Irish. While digital outreach is important, many rural areas still face weak broadband and some cohorts of people still do not have adequate digital skills or access to digital devices, so offline methods such as local papers, radio, and community newsletters remain essential. This inclusive approach reduces the perceived distance between citizens and EU institutions. Ireland’s EU Presidency should create opportunities for people to shape discussions, not just listen to them. Participatory events involving rural youth, older people, community volunteers, farmers and migrants can capture diverse priorities. A national “Rural Voices for Europe” dialogue could gather perspectives from communities nationwide and feed them into EU-level forums. Community organisations should be supported to host local Presidency-related events that reflect their interests and identities, reinforcing that the EU belongs to its citizens. As part of this participatory approach, the EU Rural Pact could host an event in Ireland during the Presidency, with the Department of Rural and Community Development working alongside organisations such as Irish Rural Link. This event should be located outside of Dublin – in a rural setting. This would provide a high-profile platform to discuss rural and community issues beyond agriculture, showcase innovation, and strengthen Europe-wide cooperation. Supporting IRL and similar organisations to coorganise public sessions, workshops and community dialogues would ensure broad engagement and meaningful outcomes. By making EU benefits visible, empowering local networks and communities, communicating clearly, involving citizens directly and leveraging existing EU platforms such as the Rural Pact, Ireland can ensure its 2026 Presidency feels inclusive, relevant and genuinely owned by the people it represents."

Culture, through storytelling, shared experience, and critical reflection, plays a distinct role in strengthening social cohesion and building a sense of collective purpose. The Presidency offers and opportunity to foreground initiatives that support civic education, citizen assemblies, cultural participation, media literacy, and the arts as spaces for imaginative public dialogue across Europe. A HUMAN-CENTRED GREEN AND DIGITAL TRANSITION Europe’s twin transitions will only succeed if they are socially just, culturally embedded, and accessible to all communities. Ireland can lead a Presidency programme that places people and cultural meaning at the heart of these transitions: supporting creative climate communication, cultural approaches to environmental stewardship, and ethically grounded digital innovation. This includes the role of the creative and cultural sectors in designing inclusive technologies, centring human agency, and ensuring that technological change aligns with European values. BUILDING A EUROPE OF PEACE, CULTURE, AND SHARED FUTURES While the Presidency must remain neutral, Ireland’s history of peacebuilding, reconciliation, and cultural diplomacy positions it well to highlight Europe’s ongoing work in sustaining peaceful societies.

While free movement is a cornerstone of EU membership, millions of EU citizens living in other Member States lack access to meaningful community networks, civic participation, and reliable integration support. In practice, many rely on informal third-party social media groups to navigate work, housing, healthcare, language, and rights. This weakens social cohesion, labour market integration, and democratic engagement across the Union. Ireland’s own history of emigration and long-standing experience with diaspora engagement give it particular credibility to elevate this issue in a European, non-national way. Addressing what happens after mobility aligns directly with EU objectives on cohesion, democracy, and inclusion."
443,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/30723e8d/Individual_submission_-_Submission_443.docx,,,,,2,"The Irish Presidency should focus on practical areas where progress can realistically be made within a six-month term, rather than attempting to introduce major new legislation. This means concentrating on issues that affect the everyday lives of people who have moved from one EU country to another and are living outside their home country. Key priorities should include helping EU citizens better understand and exercise their rights, supporting diaspora communities to settle into work and local life, encouraging participation in cultural, educational and civic activities, and making public information and services easier to find and use online. While many rights and supports exist in theory, in practice people often struggle to access them without local knowledge or informal help. There are already EU programmes that can help address these challenges, including funding for citizen engagement, education and training, cultural projects and democratic participation. However, many people living abroad are simply unaware of these opportunities or do not know how to access them. The Presidency should therefore focus on making better use of what already exists, improving coordination between EU institutions, national authorities and local organisations, and ensuring these supports reach diaspora communities directly. This is more effective than setting up new systems from scratch. The Irish Presidency should also aim to secure formal acknowledgement from EU governments that many people who live and work in another Member State struggle to fully settle in or take part in community and civic life. These difficulties are often invisible at policy level and are left to individuals to manage on their own. To address this, the Presidency should encourage the development of clearly identifiable and easy-to-find diaspora support networks, especially in cities with large and diverse EU populations. These networks should act as first points of contact for newcomers, helping them understand local systems, find reliable information, connect with others, and navigate work, housing and community life. Importantly, they should also create opportunities for people from different EU backgrounds to meet and interact, rather than remaining isolated within nationality-based groups. The Presidency should support small-scale pilot projects and practical exchanges between Member States and cities with established diaspora populations. These should focus on measures that genuinely help people settle and participate, such as welcome hubs, peer mentoring for new arrivals, joint cultural events, and civic initiatives that bring together different EU communities. Successful approaches should be documented and shared so they can be adapted elsewhere. Progress should be measured by whether the challenges faced by people living outside their home country are clearly recognised at EU level, whether authorities and diaspora organisations work more closely together, and whether EU citizens abroad have realistic and accessible ways to take part in social, cultural and democratic life where they live."

Better support can help people who have moved from one EU country to another find work that matches their skills and understand how local labour markets operate, instead of feeling left to figure things out alone. Stronger diaspora and cross-diaspora networks can also reduce loneliness and isolation, particularly for people who arrive without an existing community to turn to. Creating spaces where people from different EU backgrounds can meet helps break down social silos and encourages a stronger sense of belonging. When diaspora communities are better informed about their rights and about EU-funded opportunities, trust in EU institutions increases, because people can see and feel the benefits of EU membership in their own lives. Overall, this approach supports diaspora individuals in settling and contributing, helps employers connect with a more confident and integrated workforce, and strengthens host communities by building connections across different European backgrounds."

This means highlighting real stories from people who live and work in another EU country — how they found their footing, where they struggled, and what helped them feel part of their new home. Public events, cultural programmes and local partnerships during the Presidency should actively involve diaspora groups and take place in cities with large EU communities. These activities should show how EU membership makes it possible to move, work and build a life across borders, while also recognising that people need better support to truly belong. By focusing on the everyday realities of diaspora life rather than EU institutions, Ireland can help people see themselves reflected in the Presidency. This approach would strengthen a sense of shared ownership, particularly among EU citizens living abroad, and reinforce the idea of the EU as something that is lived and experienced through communities, not just governed from Brussels."

We propose a theme of “Under One Sky” as the overarching high level theme. This offers a unifying metaphor to share challenges and opportunities across member states and beyond borders. This theme emphasizes equality, interconnectedness and is future oriented for stewardship, sustainability and strategic thinking. The sky is one resource literally shared by every European citizen. Whether in rural, remote or urban regions; every community lives “under one sky”. As a slogan, it resonates with themes of solidarity, belonging, equality and accessibility, all of which are central to the EU’s core values. The concept provides a narrative frame to articulate EU citizenship: freedom of movement, mobility, connectivity, cultural exchange, research collaboration, and the idea that European decisions have a common impact on all of us. The proposed theme “Under One Sky” reflects core themes within the EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and the Nature Restoration Law, which requires action plans from Member states during the period when Ireland will be hosting the Presidency such as: Upholding the protection of nature and the reversal of ecosystem degradation. Connection of citizens in a thriving future oriented society of equality and inclusion. Strengthen Climate Action maintaining just transitions and human and planetary health."

Several Member States, including Czechia and Spain, advanced this work during their Presidencies, demonstrating its significance as a pan-European issue for coordinated EU action. Building on this momentum would reflect Ireland’s role as a neutral facilitator while responding holistically to EU Member State needs. Including a focus on light pollution would draw directly on the scientific and policy recommendations set out in the Horizon Europe PLAN-B Policy Brief on Light Pollution Mitigation issued in 2025. Ref: https://zenodo.org/records/15707106 Nature Restoration Law: Light pollution is explicitly referenced in the texts of the Nature Restoration resolution, which calls on Member States to identify and mitigate artificial light pressures in their national restoration plans. The Irish Presidency could facilitate progress by: Hosting an expert-level discussion/meeting on integrating light pollution mitigation into the implementation phase of the Nature Restoration Law. Supporting work toward harmonised indicators for monitoring Artificial Light at Night (ALAN), aiding comparability across Member States and aligning with the EU Biodiversity Strategy and Global Biodiversity Framework 2030 to reduce light pollution. • Encouraging uptake of international guidance, such as the International Light Pollution Guidelines for Migratory Species (CMS) https://www.cms.int/publication/international-light-pollutionguidelines-migratory-species, to ensure EU legislation reflects current scientific consensus. Sustainable Use of Space & the Dark & Quiet Skies Movement: Dark and Quiet Skies is a global theme that raises awareness about the urgent need to preserve night skies from the negative impact of satellite constellations on ground-based optical and radio astronomy. Excessive light affects astronomy infrastructure including EU-supported observatories and satellite calibration. These concerns were central to the international IAU–UNOOSA “Dark & Quiet Skies ”initiative: https://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/dark-skies-preservation/ & https://www.iau.org/Iau/Iau/News/Ann2025/ann25010.aspx Following recent meetings: UN/SKAO Workshop on Dark and Quiet Skies for Science and Society in Vienna, and the Transnational Political Networks Workshops on Dark and Quiet Skies in Dublin, the Irish Presidency could facilitate further dialogue with scientific institutions, industry specialists and policymakers to enable both astronomy programmes (including cultural astronomy) and satellite projects to find mutually beneficial policy solutions. The Presidency could aim to achieve: An expert meeting or ministerial roundtable on Light Pollution, enabling knowledge exchange and preparing future EU initiatives building on work initiated in Czechia and Spain. A shared EU roadmap, to mitigate, monitoring and reduce Light Pollution and the impacts of ALAN across Europe. Support for including light pollution in the Commission’s 2026–27 work programme, within the frameworks zero-pollution, urban environment or biodiversity frameworks.

Reducing light pollution brings the following benefits to people, businesses and communities across the EU For people: improved sleep, wellbeing, access to nature, and restored views of the night sky as a shared cultural and scientific resource. For communities: safer, well-designed lighting solutions; enhanced public spaces; reduced municipal energy costs; and stronger engagement with environmental protection. For businesses: best practice European guidance on sustainable lighting; development opportunities for lighting and design industries in the EU; and innovation in satellite-friendly, astronomy-compatible technologies. For biodiversity and ecosystems: improved conditions for pollinators, migratory species, and nocturnal wildlife, supporting implementation of the Nature Restoration Regulation. These benefits reflect EU-wide priorities under the European Green Deal, Zero Pollution ambition, Biodiversity Strategy, and energy-efficiency objectives.

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
383,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cd5d4c5f/Killough_Community_Association_-_Submission_383.docx,Community Organization,NGO,Environmental,Rural,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."

Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri-investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry-specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

The rationale for this theme is that the stated priorities in successive Presidencies, and in the programs of the Commission, focus on the “big ticket” items and are oriented to the institutions, corporations, business, opinion-formers and high achievers. Of course, these are important and drive Europe’s prosperity and security. But there does not seem to be much consideration to the “ordinary” people, places and businesses that constitute the vast majority of Europe, and indeed are its “foundation layer”. Large swathes of Europe’s people and places have lesser opportunities, especially rural areas (83% of the territory, 140 million people), lower-income suburbia, and second-/third-tier cities. These are increasingly being left behind and become disengaged. For many, it is difficult to see their part in Europe’s future, or to see positive prospects for themselves or where they live, or that policies of the Union are for their benefit rather than imposing burdens. Three priorities are proposed. These are consistent with the policy programmes of recent Presidencies, the Strategic Agenda for the Union and the Work Programme of the EC, but until now they have not been articulated or developed. Equalising Opportunity throughout the European territory. Much of Europe’s people and places not only have lesser opportunities, but perceive that gaps will only get wider, resulting in a two- or multi-tier society. This is unlikely to end well. More attention is needed to establishing a sense of balance and fairness, and improving prospects, in all parts of Europe. Accelerating the European Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas. The LTVRA is for a “Stronger, Connected, Resilient and Prosperous” Europe by 2040. The core pillars are not advancing equally, and some areas lack either obligations on the Member States and their region to deliver specific outcomes, or a structured program with funding to enable delivery. The physical connectivity part of the Connected pillar is especially lacking in plans, actions or funding. A fresh urgency is required to transform the “vision” to measurable “commitment”. Prioritising climate-related measures that can be delivered during 2027-2030. Much of Europe’s climate and decarbonisation strategy is based on technology, infrastructure, major investments, regulation and phasing out. These will only deliver at scale in the 2030’s and 2040’s. Many require significant cost for citizens. There are very many ordinary and pragmatic measures that can be delivered in the immediate term, by local-level organisations, communities and citizens. This is especially the case for rural mobility, where low-cost local measures can be rapidly deployed Europe-wide. These urgently need to be mobilised."

For clarity, “rural mobility” refers to the ability of people to move about and access whatever is relevant to them. It is about the full diversity of people in Europe being able to live their daily lives, and access all that they need, without being dependent on personal ownership and use of private cars. It also incorporates dimensions of accessibility to places and their businesses/amenities, and to tourism. The SMARTA project (2018-2020), initiated by the European Parliament and commissioned by DG MOVE, identified the lack of rural mobility policy through Europe’s Member States, or at the European level itself. By “policy” is meant defined goals, specified targets, assigned responsibility to deliver, and sufficient funding to achieve the agreed targets. The consequence is low/no provision of mobility service in most of Europe’s rural areas, despite Member States having all required competence, powers, organizational capacity and financial capacity. This is in stark contrast to the commitment, high quality and major funding of mobility for the urban areas of Europe. What should be the focus of the work for the Irish Presidency? The policy priority is to establish a requirement for all Member States to develop a Rural Mobility Policy, and to assign sufficient resources to deliver their policy. Key aspects to be incorporated in policy include: That citizens have reasonable physical access to avail of a broad defined range of opportunities and services, regardless of where in the Union they are resident; That rural mobility is explicitly integrated with rural development, population retention, restoration of services at local level, and the social/business fabric of rural areas; That mobility is measured, mobility deficits are identified and remedied to a committed standard; That GHG reduction and decarbonisation is an explicit part of rural mobility policy, and goes beyond electrification of vehicles, with particular focus on reducing Vehicle-Kilometres Travelled (VKT); That EU and national programs, such as the Social Climate Fund, are directed to improvements, and not towards compensation for problems that are not remedied. What should the Presidency aim to do and achieve? Convene workshops and other interactions to (i) define and dimension the issue; (ii) identify good practice and further options at policy, program and deployment levels; (iii) understand the regulatory, institutional and deployment frameworks around Europe and how they enable or inhibit development of rural mobility; (iv) explore why Member States and their regions have not to date acted to develop rural mobility to the level required by their citizens. Recognising the subsidiarity principle that local mobility is a competence of Member States, and that most (or all) Member States have to-date failed to plan and act to deliver adequate mobility throughout their territories, identify mechanisms at European level that will persuade or oblige Member States to act. Prepare recommendations for TRAN Committee to consider it as a work item."

By their nature, much of what is needed by the inhabitants of smaller towns, villages and rural areas of dispersed population is located elsewhere. Increasingly, services, amenities and employment has been concentrated in larger urban areas, so that even local towns are now being hollowed out. People in rural areas have to travel further and more often to access what they need. This includes services and amenities to which by are entitled under public policies - including healthcare, training social services, and access to the administration – but they cannot reach them or can only do so at high cost, due to the lack of public or other collective transport. The local businesses and amenities are impacted by the reduced customer base who can only reach them by car, while communities become increasingly isolated. The Council can reverse these trends and deficits by encouraging, and ultimately requiring, the Member States to implement sufficient and consistent levels of public and collective transport. It begins with defined goals and specific targets, which must then be followed up by deployment measures and funding allocation. For rural mobility/transport, this has a very short pipeline since there is only minimal infrastructure required (if any), vehicle fleet is readily available throughout rural areas, and it only takes some months to procure mobility services. Most importantly, the delivery structures are already in place through municipality administrations, rural development organisations (e.g. TCU’s, LEADER Action Group), the communities themselves and transport operators. The main requirement is political will and leadership. This is where the Council is ideally placed - and indeed may be the only entity – to give the needed push throughout Europe. This will have an immediate positive impact on the quality of life and opportunities for Europe’s rural residents. It will give those without the use of a car access to much of what they need. Rural youth will be better able to access opportunities and choose to remain, combatting depopulation trends. People of all ages will have better access to healthcare, which will also improve earlier detection for various conditions. Households will be under less pressure to purchase additional cars and be better off by reducing motoring costs. Rural businesses can access a larger customer base, while neighbouring rural villages and communities can form stronger clusters by having local connectivity. Rural tourism will be strengthened by enabling visitors to arrive and move within areas without their car. From the environmental perspective, there are major immediate gains in reducing carbon emissions by reducing vehicle-kilometres travelled (VKT). More people using people and collective transport leads to less vehicles converging on urban areas, thereby relieving pressures on the main access roads and demand for parking."

It has already been amply demonstrated throughout the European rural development programs that the local-level is well able to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for a very wide range of innovative and traditional initiatives. If they are empowered and given access to funding, developing the required operational and technical capacity for rural mobility is straightforward, as demonstrated in the SMARTA-NET project or the US Rural Transport Assistance Program. Benefits of European membership are very evident in cross-European networking, peer-to-peer engagement and know-how exchange. In the domain of rural mobility, this has been amply demonstrated in the SMARTA-NET project, in which over 70 rural municipalities and other stakeholders from 15 EU countries participated in the European Rural Mobility Network (ERMN). As a result of the high appreciation of the participants, the ERMN has now been established on a permanent basis to provide rural municipalities and stakeholders with a shared platform to develop their capacities."

These are also emphasized in the Strategic Agenda for the Union and the Work Programme of the EC.

At the Final Conference held in the Berlaymont, the ERMN proposed a diagnostic on the key issues for rural mobility, and a set of policy recommendations, they key being: I1) assign the same importance to rural mobility as to urban mobility; (2) rationalize VKT to achieve European and national goals for accessibility and decarbonization; (3) convince Member States to develop policy and targets for rural mobility; (4) assign sufficient resources to deliver enhanced rural mobility, at scale; and (5) mobilise and empower the local level to deliver solutions.

The Review of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement is expected to be concluded in 2026, probably during the Irish Presidency, and this could be an important moment to create new positive momentum for the EU’s relationship with the UK. The EU-UK Summit of 2025 concluded with a declaration of a Common Understanding of the way forward for the two parties. The Summit largely reached agreements in principle rather than legally operational text and the Common Understanding is limited in its ambitions, but nevertheless a platform has been established for improving the UK’s interactions with the EU. The Summit achieved significant progress on an SPS Agreement and some initial steps on Security and Defence, but nothing of substance on Mutual Recognition and Professional Mobility. The Conservative European Forum is concerned that the positive (if limited) outcomes of the May Summit have not been realised in concrete agreements and little progress has been made since then. It calls on both the EU and the UK to engage constructively with greater urgency. An ambition of the Irish Presidency could be to achieve operational texts completing the Review of the TCA and fulfilling the goals of the Common Understanding by the end of its term.

However, the Understanding stated that a dialogue on individual travel for business purposes should be initiated. Although there is a lack of transparency about the status of talks, a Youth Mobility Programme appears to be under active discussion. With clear benefits for both sides, any outstanding points should be quickly resolved with flexibility and goodwill on both sides. While resolution of some of these issues may occur before the commencement of the Irish Presidency, there are still likely to be areas where Ireland can make a significant contribution to achieving greater understanding between the two sides. Ireland’s familiarity with the details of the EU-UK relationship through its experience of the Northern Ireland Protocol and the Windsor Framework means that it will be well placed to achieve new agreements and deepen cooperation."

While many of the issues under consideration are complex, negotiations between the parties should be expedited and urgent attention given to more areas where expanded cooperation can bring benefits to both the UK and the EU. In particular, the CEF suggests that the Irish Presidency should focus on the following areas of work. Given the security challenges facing Europe from Russia and the apparent isolationism (if not hostility) from the United States, it is overdue that the EU and the UK should move on from dialogue to actual cooperation on security and defence issues. Despite the Common Understanding declaring that the EU’ s rearmament fund (Security Action For Europe) creates “possibilities for mutually beneficial enhanced cooperation” it is disappointing and concerning that negotiations over UK participation in SAFE have broken down. It is hoped that both sides can move quickly to define the process under which participation can take place in the areas identified by the Security and Defence Partnership. Although the UK has stated that it is willing to participate selectively in Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, this would be facilitated by a Framework Participation Agreement that would define the scope of participation more closely. The Irish Presidency can assist the UK and EU to • Conclude a Framework Participation Agreement (FPA) to enable the United Kingdom’s selective participation in missions and operations. • Finalise an Administrative Arrangement (AA) with the European Defence Agency (EDA), allowing UK involvement in key projects under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework. Although CEF seeks a comprehensive and evolving reset of the EU-UK relationship it sees no reason why the SPS Agreement should be delayed by negotiations on other aspects of the Common Understanding. • To maintain the progress achieved with the Common Understanding, if not already concluded the Irish Presidency should enable the UK and EU to finalise and implement an SPS Agreement as soon as possible. The absence of any reference to Mutual Recognition in the Common Understanding is a missed opportunity to develop cooperation in this important area. This could be achieved on the basis of the previous MRPQ Directive and the historic degree of regulatory alignment rather than sector-by-sector negotiations. The CEF hopes that the Irish Presidency may • Negotiate a comprehensive UK–EU Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications (MPRQ) Agreement to restore widespread recognition of UK professional qualifications across the EU. Enhanced mobility can bring mutual benefits, especially in many aspects of professional and business services. The Common Understanding makes provision for dialogue in these areas but as yet there is no clarity about this process. The Irish Presidency could lead a dialogue between the UK and EU on how to • Expand the range of short-term business activities permitted without a visa, including client meetings, training, and project delivery."

Increased economic and cultural exchanges can provide a new impetus for growth and create new opportunities, especially for young people. These exchanges will build enhanced trust, as a basis for even closer integration in the future. In an age of geopolitical insecurity, binding the UK into a range of relationships with the EU can strengthen the Union’s strategic and economic autonomy. The UK can be of use to the EU for many issues, especially defence, and the EU should continue to build a framework of agreements within which the UK can contribute to the EU meeting its goals. The Irish Presidency can be the occasion to improve and formalise economic and trade relationships in key sectors of interest to the EU, through the establishment of Joint Industry Cooperation Discussion Bodies."

Due for review in 2025/26, the TCA is a free trade agreement that ensures zero tariffs and quotas on goods moving between the UK and EU but contains fewer provisions for services, an area critical to the UK economy, and little in the way of foreign and defence policy cooperation. On 27 February 2023, the Conservative European Forum (CEF) initiated an Inquiry into the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), led by Sir David Lidington and Stephen Hammond MP. Throughout the following year, CEF conducted nine evidence sessions with over 40 witnesses from business, industry, and non-governmental organisations. The Inquiry highlighted that there exists considerable potential to implement practical, industry-driven solutions both within and outside the TCA framework, to strengthen UK-EU relations in areas of mutual self-interest. The Windsor Framework, established in February 2023, resolved disagreements over the Northern Ireland Protocol, fostering a cautious re-building of trust. The TCA’s upcoming review in 2025/26 coincides with the expiration of several key provisions, presenting an opportunity to reassess the relationship in light of geopolitical shifts. Despite remaining widespread scepticism, there is now some initial interest in discussing access to the Customs Union or Single Market. Any changes must be navigated within the existing framework of the TCA or through the negotiation of supplementary agreements. The Inquiry categorised recommendations for enhancing UK-EU cooperation into two primary areas: economic and political. Economically, the emphasis is on reducing trade barriers, while politically, the focus is on strategic collaboration, particularly in foreign and defence policy as outlined in the Political Declaration. Priority should be given to recommendations that provide the greatest benefit, either politically or economically, and that have a realistic opportunity to be agreed."

Mannok Pack is a standalone business providing sustainable packaging solutions to both local and international markets. As one of the largest employers in the region (800 No.) aspiring to be a leader in sustainability, Mannok would like to see a strong focus on mobility decarbonisation using hydrogen which cannot be electrified i.e. heavy long-range trucking (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs). As an Island nation with an underdeveloped rail network, nationally Ireland is heavily dependent on HGVs to move goods both around and in/out of the country. Trucks or HGVs have a disproportionately large impact on emissions due to their weight and average mileage. Mannok owns its own large fleet of trucks, 200 No. They all currently operate on diesel, which is atypical for all fleet operators across the E.U. Mannok is currently developing an ambitious and innovative green hydrogen project where the primary off taker is the fleet to displace its diesel equivalent. The fleet consumes over 4 million liters of diesel a year, which is equivalent to nearly 11,000t/CO2eq. Mannok is just one of many such fleet operators. The HGVs are used to transport products, fuels and raw materials daily on the Island of Ireland. Local haulage companies deliver our products to G.B. Additionally at least 40-50 HGVs arrive daily at Mannok either as a supplier or a customer. This demonstrates significant off-taker potential, economies of scale and will help support the Government in meetings its obligations under the Climate Action Plan and national emissions targets. Mannok is technology agnostic whether the HGV’s platform is based on hydrogen fuel cell, combustion engine or re-power option. The key criteria is for cost parity with its diesel equivalent. This will require significant investment and collaboration across the entire value chain. Ireland’s E.U. presidency in 2026 offers a unique opportunity to advocate for businesses, hydrogen mobility and decarbonisation. Mannok believes our objectives align very well with that of the Department of Transport (& Department of Infrastructure in NI) desire to see hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) built in Dublin and Belfast as part of an All-Ireland energy project and the European Union's mandate under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) to build a widespread hydrogen refuelling network – One every 200 km on the Trans European Transport Network (TEN-T) core network and in urban nodes by 2030. Mannok is located on the border c100 miles or 160km from the nearest port. The ability of a company like Mannok to decabonise its fleet at scale and deliver its products to the market cost competitively is existential to the future of the business, its employees, customers and the community it serves. Let’s keep Ireland moving and the E.U., sustainably."

Drinks Ireland, the Ibec sector organisation representing drinks manufacturing, export and supply businesses across the island of Ireland, welcomes the opportunity to contribute to this Government consultation and outlines below the highlevel thematic priorities, we believe, Ireland should focus on during this period. Single Market Integrity The Single Market is one of the EU’s most valuable assets. Despite its benefits for the European economy, the Single Market remains incomplete and is delivering well below its potential. With the European Commission’s recent Single Market Strategy and the Single Market Roadmap to 2028, we call on the Irish Presidency to turn those ambitions into action and remove barriers fragmenting the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital. Effective Single Market governance will be key through greater harmonisation, coherent implementation and shared responsibility for enforcement. Likewise, maintaining a level playing field for businesses and ensuring fair competition must remain a central tenet of the Single Market while improvements are made as outlined in the Ibec paper on the Single Market and Simplification: Turning Ambition Into Action. Competitiveness To strengthen the EU and react to the challenges facing business and society, we need to put competitiveness at the forefront. The Presidency must act as a leading voice for a rulesbased trading system, advance the EU-UK relationship and act as a bridge to strengthen the vital EU and US relationship. EU policymakers should also move away from over-reliance on legislation and adopt stronger investment and proactive growth measures to address challenges faced by business. Underpinning competitiveness through practical, evidencebased legislation, which is approached on an EU harmonised basis, is also critically important. Trade openness must also be at the core of the Irish Presidency’s agenda. With 85% of future economic growth predicted to take place outside of Europe, a proactive, outwardlooking common trade policy, paired with the ability to attract investment, remains among the EU’s most powerful assets. Digital Solutions To support the further development of the Single Market, the Irish Presidency should help deliver a meaningful framework and programme to support digital-first solutions such as digital labelling. A stable, predictable, effective and coherent digital regulatory framework will facilitate EU competitiveness, investment and growth, creating conditions for digital innovation."

Irish Whiskey Association",National & EU wide,2,"For the Irish business community, it is positive that the European Commission’s 2026 Work Programme places emphasis on enhancing competitiveness and pushing forward with legislative simplification. The simplification agenda remaining at the forefront is in line with calls from business for a pause in the introduction of new legislation in order to ensure proper implementation of new rules from the previous mandate. Drinks Ireland outlines below the policy areas that the Irish Presidency should consider prioritising during its term. Harmonised approach across sectoral product legislation (labelling) The Irish Presidency should ensure a general harmonised approach across sectoral product legislation, where necessary, to avoid fragmentation of the Single Market and creation of an additional cost burden for business. The emergence of national schemes and additional labelling and packaging requirements disrupt the trade of goods across the EU. National measures such as labelling requirements and bans on EU approved substances are particularly prevalent in the food and drink sector. When such measures are introduced, they undermine EU harmonisation efforts, result in trade distortions in the Single Market and create an additional cost burden for business. Recent legislation requiring the unilateral introduction of new alcohol labelling provisions in the Irish market is a key example of this. We welcomed the two-year deferral of these provisions. Moreover, we fully agree with the comments made by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and a number of Government Ministers that such labelling requirements should really be pursued ‘in concert’ with the EU as a harmonised EU approach maintains the integrity of the EU Single Market and avoids unnecessary trade disruption. We are equally cognisant in the context of restoring trade relations with the US, that the US Administration has identified such unilateral member state legislation as a non-tariff trade barrier, undermining its exporters to efficiently serve the EU market. Action in this area, as part of the Irish Presidency, will address the key themes of Single Market Integrity and Competitiveness. Trade, Market Development and Diversification In the absence of long-term stability and predictability, the Irish Presidency must support the strengthening of existing bilateral partnerships, while delivering new agreements that simultaneously enhance trade cooperation with third countries and deliver new market diversification opportunities for business. The delivery of actions agreed at the 2025 EU-UK Summit and the 2026 review of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement offers significant opportunities to advance the EU’s relationship with its third-largest trading partner accounting for the realities of the all-island economy. The EU-US Joint Statement can also provide concrete opportunities for business. The Irish Presidency period could be crucial to making further progress towards restoring trade relations with the US, in particular, to delivering as extension of tariff exclusion for the drinks sector and restoring zero for zero tariff trading position. Ireland will have an important role to play in supporting the advancement of new free trade agreements and EU enlargement. Our industry needs ambitious trade agreements that encourage trade relations through reduced tariffs, removal of non-tariff barriers, protection of our Geographic Indications for Irish Spirits and safeguarding our All-Island cross-border supply chains through appropriate rules of origin. Concluding a meaningful and competitive EU-India free trade agreement is a high priority for the Irish drinks sector. Digital-first (e.g., eLabelling) approach Digital labelling should be embraced to improve the functioning of the single market and reduce compliance costs for economic operators. It allows for the enhanced provision of information to consumers, accommodating additional information and the ability to provide and make changes in different languages in a more efficient manner."

Given Ireland’s history of leading rural development practices and processes in Europe, and that we are one of the few countries in Europe with a dedicated Ministry for Rural Development (the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht), the Presidency of the Council in 2026 is happening at an apt time and opportunity to continue this leadership role. The EU Rural Pact has particularly highlighted the key role the dedicated Government Department plays in its leadership of one of Europe’s few National Rural Strategies: ‘Our Rural Future’. A high-level rural policy thematic focus is important and necessary during Ireland's 2026 Presidency, primarily serving to translate the high-level Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas (LTVRA) into concrete action and secure its future funding. This directly aligns with the EU Strategic Agenda for 2024-29, which prioritises a Europe that is free and democratic, strong and secure, and prosperous and competitive. It also builds on previous Member States’ contribution to rural policy during their Presidencies, such as Spain’s High-Level Rural Policy Forum in Siguenza, September 2023. By furthering the goals of the LTVRA, Ireland’s Presidency can contribute concretely to bolstering competitiveness, supporting innovative rural territories, and developing green and digital transitions. As part of this, three high-level thematic priorities are identified here that address the core socio-demographic challenges of depopulation and inequality faced by rural areas, rooted in the LTVRA's four action areas (Stronger, Connected, Resilient, Prosperous Rural Areas). Strengthening Territorial Cohesion and the 'Right to Stay': This priority makes the 'right to stay' a central political theme, focusing on the fundamental living conditions needed to retain and attract rural populations. It addresses the persistent socio-economic gaps and aims to reduce disparities between rural and other areas, a key objective under Article 174 TFEU (https://eurlex.europa.eu/eli/treaty/tfeu_2008/art_174/oj/eng). Connecting Rural Europe: Connectivity, both physical and digital, is cited as a most urgent need by rural citizens. The focus should be on practical, sustainable solutions, advancing legislative work on digital infrastructure while promoting innovative integrated rural mobility plans that ensure essential access to services, employment, and education for all rural inhabitants. Empowering Local Communities and Economic Diversification: This theme highlights the need for a truly bottom-up approach to development. It supports the Prosperous and Resilient LTVRA pillars by fostering new, non-traditional economic activities beyond the primary sector. It champions Community-Led Local Development (CLLD/LEADER), the social economy, and remote work, ensuring that local communities have the capacity and resources to innovate and manage their own transitions."
302,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/3dd3cef2/Individual_submission_-_Submission_302.docx,University College Dublin,,,,2,"Considering Vice-President Fitto’s ‘Right to Stay’ Initiative, which he outlined in a speech on September 16th, 2025, to the Rural Pact Conference in Courtrai, Belgium, Ireland is particularly well-placed in its Presidency to develop this policy and related legislation in 2026. As a predominately rural country, and as leaders in rural policy in Europe, Ireland can focus work on the following themes that would help to address the Right to Stay initiative, and keep the Long-Term vision central: Driving the Transition from Vision to Concrete Action The Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas (LTVRA) and the Rural Pact have established a vision for rural policies and areas, but it requires continuous, high-level political push to move from planning to implementation. A Presidency focus is necessary to: provide a platform to advance Council priorities (such as rural housing and mobility/connectivity), ensuring these issues are discussed at the Ministerial level. Establish a 'Right to Stay' Mandate by championing the right of citizens to live and thrive in their home communities. This focuses the entire rural agenda on addressing depopulation and service access. Ensuring Policy Coherence and 'Rural-Proofing' Rural policy challenges, such as connectivity and access to services, cut across multiple EU policy areas (agriculture, cohesion, transport, digital, etc). The Council Presidency has a unique role in coordination, by supporting a high-level forum to bring together key Ministries and Directorate-Generals (DGs) to coordinate efforts and enhance the coherence and synergies between policies and funding instruments (such as the new proposals for Cohesion Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy). Influencing the Post-2027 Financial Framework The second half of 2026 is a crucial period for influencing the debate on the next EU Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) and the structural funding programmes (post-2027). The Presidency provides a high-profile platform to advocate for adequate, ring-fenced financial support for non-agricultural rural initiatives, such as Community-Led Local Development (CLLD/LEADER). Ireland will also have the opportunity to define the next programme of the EU by building on previous events such as the Siguenza High-Level Forum (2023; under Spain’s Presidency), by serving as a key step in defining the direction of rural and cohesion policies post-2027, ensuring that the new budgetary cycle is fit for the LTVRA goals. Amplifying Local Voices and Promoting Ownership Focus on Multi-Level Governance by listening to the voices of rural actors, in particular Local Action Groups (LAGs), civil society, and regional authorities, and members of the Rural Pact community. This participatory approach is essential for legitimacy."
302,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/3dd3cef2/Individual_submission_-_Submission_302.docx,University College Dublin,,,,3,"The Irish Presidency can make the most substantial positive impact by translating the goals of the LTVRA into concrete, people-centred outcomes that demonstrate the EU's commitment to Territorial Cohesion, Rural Development, and the ‘Right to Stay’. This can be done by directly addressing the cost of living and quality of life for those living in or wishing to return to live in rural areas. By prioritising rural housing, the Presidency can directly tackle a critical barrier to the 'right to stay.' In addition, supporting rural areas by championing CLLD/LEADER, the Presidency can amplify rural voices and ensure that local communities and civil society organisations are seen as essential partners, not just recipients, in policy implementation. This strengthens local capacity and creates a sense of ownership over EU initiatives. Finally, there can be an impact on future-proofing rural economies, by focusing on economic diversification, the social economy, and digital upskilling, ensuring that rural areas are positioned to benefit from the Green and Digital Transitions. This creates new, quality job opportunities, particularly for young people and women, thereby combating depopulation and making rural life a viable, attractive choice for future generations. Based on the above, a key focus could be: Rural Housing - contribute to the EU focus on housing by launching an EU-level Initiative/Expert Group on Rural Housing, addressing the demographic and housing challenges identified in the LTVRA. Aim to inform the post-2027 Cohesion policy framework by identifying policy flexibility and best practices to unlock funding for affordable, quality rural housing development. Community-Led Local Development (CLLD/LEADER) - As part of the Post-2027 Financial Framework Discussions, secure a strong political statement, reaffirming the necessity of CLLD/LEADER as a mandatory, bottom-up governance model for all Member States. Specifically, advocate for ring-fencing of an adequate, visible budget share from relevant EU Funds (Cohesion, CAP) to protect this successful participatory model from budgetary cuts. Rural Mobility & Services - Drive progress on transport, energy and digitalisation to incorporate a ruralproofing requirement, ensuring new EU infrastructure legislation explicitly addresses the needs of sparsely populated areas. Focus on the deployment of digital solutions to ensure equitable access to public and private services (health, education) across rural territories."
302,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/3dd3cef2/Individual_submission_-_Submission_302.docx,University College Dublin,,,,4,"Host a Major Event in a Rural Location: Instead of holding all major events in Dublin, the Presidency should host a High-Level Rural Policy Conference (building on Siguenza 2023) in a prominent Irish rural town or regional city (e.g. in the West or North-West). This would symbolise the Presidency's commitment to rural Europe and grants citizens outside the capital direct involvement and ownership. The EU Rural Pact – there is an opportunity to host a meeting of the Rural Pact Coordination Group in Ireland during the Presidency. The RPCG holds approximately three meetings per year, usually in Brussels, but there is now a shift in focus under the continuing mandate of the RPCG, whereby it is envisaged that one of those meetings per year, will be held in a member state. Ireland could therefore be the first Member State to host a meeting of the RPCG, which is comprised of representatives from DG AGRI and DG REGIO, the European Parliament, civil society, research agencies, and social enterprise. Translate Policy into People's Stories: Communication should shift from bureaucratic legislative summaries to showcasing real-life stories and local project successes. Highlight how an EU Cohesion/Structural Fund investment leads to a new local service, an affordable housing scheme, or a community transport solution. This links the abstract values of solidarity and cohesion to the tangible benefits of EU membership. Amplify Rural Pact Voices: The Presidency should actively use the established networks of the Rural Pact Support Office and local groups to share information, host webinars, and provide capacity-building on new legislation. By engaging directly with the 2,350+ members of the Rural Pact community, the Presidency demonstrates that it is listening to, and acting on, the needs of the rural electorate."

319,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9582d3ee/ACCA_-_Submission_319.docx,ACCA,,,,1,"We propose that the overarching theme of the Irish EU Presidency should be a growing, competitive and inclusive Europe. This theme reflects Ireland’s ambition to contribute to a Union that is resilient, forward-looking, and capable of delivering prosperity for all its citizens. In particular, these priorities directly reinforce the EU SME competitiveness agenda by equipping small and medium enterprises with the skills and capabilities needed to thrive in digital transformation and the green transition. Within this overarching vision, a key priority stands out: investment in education and training. Our conversations with employers and partners consistently highlight two key areas of acute skills shortages (i) digital and responsible AI adoption, and (ii) sustainability. This priority and these skills areas are directly aligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024 – 2029, specifically under the heading “A Prosperous and Competitive Europe.” The Agenda highlights the need for: “Investment in people’s skills, training and education throughout their lives and encouragement of talent mobility within the European Union and beyond.” This priority underlines the importance of equipping citizens with the right blend of skills to thrive in a rapidly changing labour market. It also reflects the urgency of addressing talent shortages, as evidenced by the 2024 Eurobarometer survey and ACCA’s Global Economic Conditions Survey (GECS) in 2025, both of which identify skills gaps as the most pressing risk for businesses. The draft EU Talent Pool Regulation further recognises the accountancy profession as one of 42 critical shortage professions, underscoring the need for targeted investment in education and training. (i) “Digital and responsible AI adoption” Ireland’s Presidency should highlight the responsible use of digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Innovation and digitalisation are essential drivers of competitiveness. While the importance of an ethical governance frameworks that safeguard citizens and businesses and the need for a clear legal foundation have been expressed elsewhere, there is also a need for training in the development and implementation of digital technologies and artificial intelligence. This is particularly relevant as their use is extended to support the implementation of legislation such as the Omnibus Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). (ii)“Sustainability” Delivering on Europe’s twin transitions is central to long-term prosperity. The Presidency should promote policies that help citizens and businesses adapt to sustainability requirements, while ensuring that the workforce has the skills and knowledge to support these changes. A diverse and inclusive workforce is essential to achieving this, and professions such as accountancy play a pivotal role in guiding companies – particularly SMEs – through evolving EU rules and compliance obligations. Accountancy also play a key role in assisting SME and larger businesses in achieving the competitive advantage that being sustainable brings. By framing Ireland’s Presidency around these priorities, the Council can help deliver a Europe that is competitive, inclusive, and sustainable. This approach not only reflects the EU’s strategic vision but also addresses the immediate challenges of talent scarcity, digital transformation, and the green transition. It ensures that citizens, businesses, and communities across the Union experience the benefits of EU membership in tangible and lasting ways."
319,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9582d3ee/ACCA_-_Submission_319.docx,ACCA,,,,2,"While impartiality is a defining feature of any Council Presidency, Ireland has an opportunity to shape discussions in ways that reflect both national priorities and the wider needs of the Union. Education and training stand out as particularly important areas. Ireland’s ranking of 33rd out of 35 economies in the Hays Global Talent Tracker highlights weaknesses in talent value, labour market flexibility, and education and training systems. This poor performance points to under-investment and misalignment in preparing the workforce for future needs. Supporting evidence from the Future Skills challenge report by Skillnet Ireland and the ACCA Global Talent Trends Europe report 2025 report reinforces these findings, emphasising the need for modular training, micro-credentials, bootcamps in high-demand areas, enhanced apprenticeship schemes, and stronger partnerships between industry and education providers. Against this backdrop, the Irish Presidency should aim to advance several related initiatives under the European Commission’s Work Programme 2026. These initiatives will help address Europe’s talent shortages, strengthen competitiveness, and prepare the Union for future challenges. First, under A new era for European Defence and Security, the Presidency should support measures to attract and retain talent that contributes to EU economic growth. This includes advancing reforms to the EU visa strategy and exploring a “28th regime” to foster SME innovation and entrepreneurship. Such measures will help ensure that Europe remains a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, while addressing critical workforce gaps through access to training. Second, under Supporting People and strengthening Europe’s social model, Ireland should champion proposals such as the Quality Jobs Act, the Fair Mobility Package, Skills Portability Initiative. These initiatives, alongside a comprehensive Education Package, will strengthen lifelong learning frameworks and ensure that citizens can adapt to changing labour markets. By promoting fair mobility and skills recognition, the Presidency can help create a more inclusive and resilient workforce across Member States. Finally, under Preparing for the Union of tomorrow, the Presidency should advocate for a modern, flexible, and well-funded EU budget. Clear communication and accessible funding streams for upskilling, reskilling, and training will be essential to ensure that citizens and businesses can take advantage of opportunities created by the green and digital transitions. By making EU funding more transparent and easier to access, the Presidency can help bridge the gap between policy ambition and practical implementation. Taken together, these policy areas directly advance the Commission’s Work Programme 2026 and respond to Europe’s most pressing challenges. By focusing on talent development, fair mobility, and accessible funding, Ireland’s Presidency can help deliver a Union that is competitive, inclusive, and prepared for the future."
319,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9582d3ee/ACCA_-_Submission_319.docx,ACCA,,,,3,"The Irish Presidency can deliver the most substantial positive impact by ensuring that Council work translates into tangible improvements in skills, competitiveness, and inclusivity across the Union. Building on the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, the Presidency should focus on three interlinked areas: Empowering people through lifelong learning: By prioritising Council discussions on education, training, and skills portability, the Presidency can help citizens adapt to the green and digital transitions. This includes advancing modular training, micro-credentials, and apprenticeships, ensuring that workers at all stages of their careers can retrain and remain employable. Such measures directly address the EU’s talent shortages and strengthen resilience in communities. Supporting businesses in compliance and innovation: The Presidency can facilitate smoother implementation of EU legislation such as the Omnibus CSRD. By encouraging dialogue between policymakers and professions like accountancy, businesses - especially SMEs - will gain clarity and confidence in meeting new reporting and compliance obligations. This builds transparency and trust in capital markets, while also enabling innovation and competitiveness. Strengthening communities through inclusivity and mobility: The Presidency should champion initiatives that promote fair mobility, skills recognition, and inclusive labour markets. Communities benefit when citizens can move freely, transfer skills across borders, and access quality jobs. This strengthens the social fabric of the Union and ensures that no region is left behind in the twin transitions. By focusing Council work on these areas, Ireland can help deliver a Presidency that is not only impartial but also impactful - ensuring that EU citizens, businesses, and communities experience the benefits of membership in their daily lives."
319,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9582d3ee/ACCA_-_Submission_319.docx,ACCA,,,,4,"To foster a sense of ownership, communication must be visible, relatable, and personal. Citizens engage most when they see how EU membership directly improves their lives. The Irish Presidency should therefore highlight initiatives that deliver tangible benefits: Visibility through skills and training programmes: Just as EU structural funding is made visible through signage on infrastructure projects, EU-supported training and skills programmes should be clearly branded and promoted. Citizens participating in upskilling or reskilling initiatives will see the EU’s role in their personal development, creating a lasting connection between membership and opportunity. Storytelling that connects values to everyday life: Communication should emphasise how EU values - solidarity, sustainability, and inclusivity - translate into practical benefits. For example, showcasing how EU-backed training enables mid-career transitions and makes abstract policy real and relatable. Engagement through local and digital platforms: The Presidency should leverage community organisations, universities, and professional bodies to co-host events and campaigns. Digital platforms can amplify these stories, ensuring that citizens across Europe feel part of the Presidency’s work. Celebrating professional contributions: Professions and trade association provide the framework for qualifications and also provide the training opportunities and as such play a pivotal role in providing training and upskilling opportunities for EU citizens. Highlighting their contribution demonstrates how EU membership empowers trusted professions to support businesses and communities. Transparency through corporate reporting: Companies should include disclosures in their annual reports highlighting investments in education and training, and specifying which areas were supported by EU funding. This practice would encourage organisations to reflect on their overall education strategy while making the EU’s contribution visible to stakeholders. By making EU initiatives visible, personal, and connected to citizens’ aspirations, Ireland’s Presidency can strengthen public trust and foster a genuine sense of ownership over both the Presidency and EU membership itself."
102,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a03b5e77/Medical_Emergency_Response_-_Submission_102.docx,Medical Emergency Response,Volunteer group,Allergies,,1,"Ireland should choose Health as a central theme for its 2026 Presidency, with a specific focus on allergy preparedness, public awareness and emergency response training. Allergies are now one of the fastest-growing public health concerns across Europe, and the scale of the issue underscores the need for coordinated EU action. A Presidency focused on this area would deliver clear, practical benefits to millions of European citizens. The rise in allergic conditions is well documented. The prevalence of peanut allergy among children in Western countries has doubled in the past 10 years (Du Toit, 2015). Across Europe, severe reactions are becoming far more common, and food allergies alone now affect an estimated 11 to 26 million European citizens (Pawankar et al., 2013). These are everyday realities for families and schools, and the trend is moving in only one direction. Yet preparedness and awareness vary widely between Member States. Many individuals carry emergency medicines but are unsure when or how to use them. Many schools and community organisations lack clear training pathways or have inconsistent procedures for responding to anaphylaxis. These gaps increase the likelihood of delayed treatment and unnecessary medical escalation, placing additional strain on healthcare systems already facing significant pressures. - Establishing EU-wide minimum standards for allergy and anaphylaxis training, ensuring that training is affordable, accessible and delivered consistently in all Member States. -Launching a coordinated EU allergy awareness campaign, aimed at increasing recognition of allergic reactions, improving public confidence in responding to emergencies and reducing preventable harm. -Supporting Member States to expand access to emergency medicines training in schools, workplaces and community settings, accompanied by harmonised EU guidance so organisations can act confidently and lawfully."
102,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a03b5e77/Medical_Emergency_Response_-_Submission_102.docx,Medical Emergency Response,Volunteer group,Allergies,,2,"Ireland’s Presidency should focus on practical health measures that can be delivered quickly, especially those that strengthen emergency preparedness, raise public awareness and create more consistency across Member States. Allergy readiness fits well here because it affects schools, workplaces, food safety and public health, and it is an area where EU-level coordination can make a real difference without needing new complex legislation. The first priority should be to make better use of existing EU health frameworks. The EU already supports training, capacity building and exchange of best practice, but allergy preparedness is not built into this work in a meaningful way. Ireland can use its Presidency to ensure that allergy awareness and basic emergency response skills are included in the wider health security and prevention agenda. A second area should be improving consistency in training and preparedness. At the moment, every Member State has its own way of training teachers, childcare staff and people working in public spaces. Some have clear systems, others do not. Ireland can encourage agreement on shared minimum standards for responding to allergic emergencies and promote access to accredited training that can be recognised across the EU. From here, Ireland can put forward a straightforward principle: workplaces and schools across the European Union should be equally prepared to deal with allergic emergencies. Right now, the level of readiness varies a lot. Some places have trained staff and proper procedures, while others have very little in place. Ireland can use the Presidency to highlight the need for simple EU-level guidance that helps Member States build reliable systems for schools, employers and community organisations. This can include promoting access to online training that can be used across the EU. Online options would make training easier for staff and volunteers in every country, giving organisations of all sizes a practical way to build confidence and ensure that people know how to recognise and respond to an allergic reaction."

At the moment, the level of training and awareness varies widely between Member States, which leaves gaps in safety for people who rely on others knowing how to respond. Ireland’s Presidency can push for simple, shared standards on allergy awareness and basic emergency response, along with easy access to recognised training, including online options. This would give teachers, employers and community groups clear guidance and the confidence to act when needed. Making allergy preparedness consistent across the EU would improve safety for millions of European citizens and provide a straightforward, positive legacy from Ireland’s Presidency."

If Ireland focuses its Presidency on practical issues that citizens can clearly recognise, such as safety, health and community wellbeing, people will see the EU’s value in a real and personal way. Keeping messaging clear, involving schools and community groups and highlighting direct results will help citizens feel connected to the work of the Presidency and confident that EU membership delivers for them."

Making the Single Market Work - The work programme outlines a focus on “unleashing the full potential of the Single Market by 2028”. According to the Commission, this would mean removing barriers and making doing business in Europe easier for all companies, including startups and SMEs. The Irish Presidency’s thematic priority on the Single Market should reiterate Member States’ commitment to the internal market and include more active enforcement policies and infringement procedures where violations of Single Market rules and unjustified internal trade barriers are detected in Member States. Health Policies - Such actions on the Single Market also relate to the quality of health policies – when the Single Market works as it is intended for all products, medicines included, it improves the resilience of health systems’, mitigates shortages and improves patients’ access to needed therapies and affordable medicines. When it comes to health policy, we believe that health and the accessibility of medicines must be part of the overall security and preparedness agenda and should therefore be part of the thematic priorities of the Irish Presidency. Well-functioning health systems, sustainability in costs of healthcare and ensured access to the therapies needed for patients are prerequisites to stable societies and health systems that also work in times of crisis."

European Product Act - It is important to ensure that the biggest Single Market initiative of the work programme, the European Product Act, including the principles of open competition and removal of internal trade barriers such as unjustified export restrictions on goods, are strongly pursued. This is particularly important for pharmaceutical products, given that their free movement is heavily disrupted in many parts of the Union due to the restrictive measures being implemented by some Member States. Public Procurement Act – The Public Procurement Act, expected in Q2 of 2026, is an equally important piece of legislation that has the potential to further ensure fair competition and the equal standing of different legitimate actors in the market, and we would like to see this legislation advanced promptly. Critical Medicines Act - If the trilogue negotiations of the Critical Medicines Act are still on-going during the Irish Presidency of the Council, it would be important to reach an agreement and ensure that the final agreement on the Critical Medicines Act protects the principles of the Single Market, including open competition and reasonable procurement criteria. Medical Devices - Equally, quick progress on the revision of the medical devices rules, the proposal of which is expected from the Commission by the end of 2025, would be vital to ensuring predictability and harmonization in the market."

When working on health policies and the Single Market, the emphasis should be placed on EU-wide angles and harmonising actions, instead of separate national actions that could then considerably differ from one Member State to another. When it comes to Single Market policies especially, separate national actions are often counterproductive to the objectives of the Single Market. A Single Market Focus - The single most effective action to make the most substantial positive impact for people, businesses and communities alike would be a strong focus on the Single Market and policies that improve the functioning of the internal market, and its enforcement. The Single Market is indeed European Union’s greatest achievement because it facilitates the everyday life of European businesses and consumers and fosters growth. Unfortunately, until recently, it has been ignored in European decision-making. The Single Market Strategy, published in May 2025, was a good start, but not yet enough. There are still products, medicines being one category, for which a true Single Market does not exist. Intra-EU trade barriers, export restrictions and other actions that hinder the functioning of the Single Market remain strongly in place. This is an issue that both undermines business operations and the lives of consumers who ultimately are the ones suffering from poor enforcement of the Single Market rules, be it in the form of higher prices, lower quality products, medicine shortages and poorer access to affordable medicines and health therapies."

About Affordable Medicines Ireland - Affordable Medicines Ireland is an association that represents the entire volume of the independent distribution of medicines industry in Ireland. Its member companies are all privately owned small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Affordable Medicines Ireland is affiliated to its European counterpart, Affordable Medicines Europe, the association representing the independent distribution of medicines in numerous EU and EEA countries. Within the European Single Market, independent distributors can buy pharmaceuticals in any EU/EEA country and then - under strictly regulated conditions – transport, repackage and resell them in another Member State. By redistributing medicines between countries at prices lower than standard local rates, independent distribution boosts competition and generates savings for patients and healthcare systems. Parallel distribution also helps alleviate shortages and improves access by supplying markets affected by availability problems, marketing delays, nonlaunches, or withdrawals. By utilising the Single Market, the parallel distribution of medicines saves approximately 5-7 billion euros to healthcare systems in Europe every year. Affordable Medicines Europe General Assembly Dublin, November 2026 - Affordable Medicines Europe is governed by its Board and General Assembly, taking place twice a year. During the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU in November 2026, Affordable Medicines Europe will organize its General Assembly in Dublin in close cooperation with Affordable Medicines Ireland. In the context of this event, we would be happy to explore collaboration possibilities, for example organizing an event in collaboration with the Presidency of the Council on access to affordable medicines and sustainability of healthcare systems.

I recommend three high-level themes: 1. “A Union Citizens Understand” – Strengthening Trust, Transparency & Engagement Public understanding of EU policymaking remains limited across Member States. Strengthening the link between citizens and European decision-making should be a core Presidency priority. Ireland is well placed to lead initiatives that make EU decisions clearer, more accessible, and more connected to daily life. This includes simplifying communication around Council outcomes, legislative negotiations, and the reasoning behind Ireland’s positions. As someone who recently spent a year on Erasmus, I saw first-hand how exposure to European institutions builds awareness and belonging, and how essential it is for young Europeans to understand the EU’s role in shaping their future. 2. “A Resilient, Fair Transition” – Climate, Digital, and Social Preparedness Europe faces simultaneous transitions: climate neutrality, digitalisation, demographic change, and geopolitical uncertainty. Ireland’s Presidency should emphasise fairness and social inclusion across these transformations. Priorities could include accelerating implementation of the Green Deal, strengthening Europe’s digital governance, progressing files linked to energy security, and ensuring that vulnerable communities, rural regions, young people, and workers in transition sectors, are supported. 3. “A Europe that Works for Young People” – Skills, Mobility & Opportunity Ireland should champion youth voices across the Presidency. Building on Erasmus, mobility programmes, and Europe’s Skills Agenda, Ireland can highlight how the EU improves opportunities for education, work, and participation. Including young people in Presidency events, consultations, and Ministerial conferences would strengthen the intergenerational legitimacy of the Presidency. Across all three themes, Ireland can build a Presidency that is accessible, ambitious, and rooted in strengthening trust in the European project."

Climate, Energy & Environmental Transition Progressing ENVI and TTE files linked to: Fit for 55 implementation, renewable energy integration, energy security, circular economy initiatives, sustainable agriculture. A focus on fairness, particularly for rural regions and young workers, will help maintain public support for the Green Deal. 2. Digital Regulation, AI, and Cybersecurity The Competitiveness Council will continue to handle: AI governance, platform accountability, digital competition rules, data flows and cybersecurity. Ireland’s position as a tech hub gives it credibility to steer consensus while prioritising public trust and fundamental rights. 3. Education, Skills, Youth & Mobility Under EYCS, Ireland should advance initiatives that strengthen student mobility, mutual recognition of qualifications, youth participation in EU processes, and Europe-wide skills development. This aligns with Ireland’s strengths and supports Europe’s long-term competitiveness. 4. Health & Crisis Preparedness Progress under EPSCO should include HERA, cross-border health cooperation, and digital health tools, building on lessons from the pandemic. 5. Economic & Financial Coordination Under ECOFIN, Ireland can support efforts to strengthen economic resilience, foster innovation, and ensure coherent implementation of fiscal rules in line with the Union’s long-term stability.

Increasing transparency strengthens trust and counters misinformation. 2. Support fair and inclusive transitions Climate and digital transitions disproportionately affect rural regions, young workers, and small businesses. Ireland can help shape files that ensure support mechanisms, reskilling pathways, and regional development tools reach these groups. This enhances cohesion and economic resilience across the EU. 3. Bring the Presidency to communities Ireland should organise Presidency events not only in Dublin but across the country. Regional discussions, local authority events, and campus engagements would allow people to feel included in Europe’s work and encourage participation. 4. Promote innovation & competitiveness Businesses will benefit from progress on digital legislation, innovation incentives, cybersecurity frameworks, cross-border data flows, and simplified access to EU funding.

Make EU decisions easy to understand Ireland should publish short, visual summaries explaining: the decisions made in each Council formation, Ireland’s priorities, why these decisions matter for citizens. Clear communication is essential for strengthening democratic legitimacy. 3. Local community engagement Town hall events, regional Presidency roadshows, and local authority partnerships can connect the EU’s work to everyday life, from farming and transport to education and digital skills. 4.

Skills, Mobility & EU Labour Market Data Supporting skills framework interoperability will enable EU talent mobility and enhance a data-driven approach to strategic workforce planning and the commensurate infrastructure and support service required. Understanding the talent gaps enables all stakeholders to develop upskilling models. Cross Border Remote Work & Social Security Co-ordination By promoting rules for cross border social security and tax alignment, this will support the right to stay and citizens remaining in the workplace for longer. By providing practical tools for employers and policymakers, this supports mobility and reduces administrative barriers. EU Pay Transparency Directive (2023/970) By harmonising pay reporting, pay gap analysis, transparency rules, through providing employer readiness tools, templates, evidence on pay equity. This will build the EU’s reputation in gender pay equity and fair remuneration.

The CIPD’s optimal contribution involves acting as a thought leader, policy influencer, research partner, and convenor of practitioners across Europe. First, CIPD Ireland can position itself as a leading voice in shaping EU-level employment and social policy debates. The Presidency period will bring heightened attention to themes such as the future of work, digital transformation, AI regulation, labour mobility, social dialogue, and workplace equality. CIPD Ireland can provide evidence-based policy recommendations to Irish government departments, particularly the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to inform Ireland’s negotiating positions at Council meetings. This includes publishing concise policy briefs summarising HR and people-management implications of key EU dossiers, offering comparative European insights, and ensuring the voice of the HR profession is embedded in policymaking. Second, CIPD Ireland can act as a knowledge hub on workforce skills and talent development, aligning its research and thought leadership with EU policy priorities such as the European Skills Agenda, the Green Transition, and digital upskilling. During the Presidency, it could launch special reports developed with universities, employers, and European HR bodies on cross-border talent flows, workplace innovation, and the impact of emerging technologies on jobs. By providing data-driven insights, CIPD Ireland can support policymakers in making informed decisions that enhance Europe’s competitiveness and social cohesion. Third, CIPD Ireland can strengthen social dialogue by facilitating collaboration between employers, trade unions, government, NGOs, and HR professionals. Hosting high-profile forums, roundtables and summits timed to coincide with official Presidency events would elevate Ireland’s leadership on employment issues. Such gatherings could explore themes like inclusive workplaces, sustainability-driven workforce change, and the evolving psychological contract. Through these events, CIPD Ireland can help translate EU-level policy goals into practical implications for organisations. Fourth, CIPD Ireland can promote Ireland as a centre of HR excellence within Europe. The Presidency presents an opportunity to showcase innovative Irish people-management practices, particularly in sectors with strong European relevance such as technology, pharmaceuticals, financial services and climate-related industries.

99,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9f98d0ac/GSK_-_Submission_99.docx,,Business,Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals,National,1,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council presents an opportunity to champion a policy agenda that reinforces the EU's role as a global leader in healthcare and pharmaceuticals. GSK proposes the theme of Better Health, Stronger Europe (rooted in prevention and health security) which centres on securing Europe’s long-term health and economic sustainability Ireland should prioritise Prevention to address the growing ageing population and its associated public health challenges during the Presidency. This demographic shift, mirrored across the EU, is projected to accelerate, with those aged 65+ expected to constitute 32.5% of the EU population by 2100, up from 21.6% in 2024. This ageing population is increasingly affected by chronic diseases, posing significant challenges to healthcare sustainability and economic stability. More generally disease prevention as a policy tends to cost less than treatment. Ireland should focus on life course immunisation, which involves protecting health at every stage of life—from infancy to older age. This approach can reduce healthcare costs, maintain workforce productivity, and ensure a healthier, more resilient society. Vaccination also plays a critical role in combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with increased vaccine coverage potentially preventing thousands of deaths annually. Ireland should champion the prevention of respiratory infections such as influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal diseases, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). These infections are leading causes of comorbidities, hospitalisation, and death across the EU. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, immunisation coverage remains below target in many EU countries. The Presidency presents an opportunity to reaffirm the EU’s commitment to health security and full implementation of SDG 3.3: ending HIV, tuberculosis (TB), viral hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as public health threats by 2030. In the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), nearly 800 000 people are living with HIV (PLHIV) and over 24 000 new HIV diagnosis occurred in 2024. Half of those diagnoses were at a late stage of infection (48%) (ECDC 2025) which highlights major gaps in prevention, testing and treatment across Member States. Furthermore, one in six of all PLHIV (17%) has not achieved viral suppression (ECDC 2025). Effective treatment that can address barriers related to adherence and stigma, such as Long Acting Injectables (LAIs), can play a crucial role in maintaining viral suppression, thereby preventing HIV transmission and contributing to ending the HIV epidemic (Parczewski et al., 2025). An Office of Health Economics report (OHE 2025) warns that, without intervention, new HIV cases could cost EU health systems €57 billion by 2030. In Ireland, the number of PLHIV is projected to rise, with the cost of inaction expected to increase by 17%, to €125 million. Ireland is positioned to get Europe back on track to achieve SDG 3.3. HIV remains a critical yet under-prioritized dimension of Europe’s communicable disease landscape. Ireland should reaffirm its 2004 HIV leadership by hosting a high-level conference to renew the Dublin Declaration and establish clear priorities for ending HIV in Europe, including expanding community-based testing, improving EU-wide surveillance, and investing in innovative LAIs for HIV treatment and prevention."
99,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9f98d0ac/GSK_-_Submission_99.docx,,Business,Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals,National,2,"Ireland is a leader in immunisation and a key supporter of the UNAIDS 2030 targets and should lead by example in both areas to develop Council Conclusions and Recommendations: A conclusion calling for Member State action and urging the Commission to develop an updated EU Action Plan on HIV and AIDS. A recommendation on the prevention of respiratory infections The timing of the Presidency also facilitates promoting legislative initiatives to mitigate against unforeseen consequences of the General Pharmaceutical Legislation and progress proposals for regulatory flexibility and the provision of EU Health Funding. Developing Conclusions & Recommendations: Ireland’s leadership on HIV, reflected in its National Sexual Health Strategy 2025-2035, positions it well to champion renewed EU action. A core priority should be the adoption of Council Conclusions calling for Member State action and urging the European Commission to develop an updated EU Action Plan on HIV and AIDS. To support this, Ireland could leverage the high-level Presidency conference to forge consensus on coordinated action. Ireland is a leader in immunisation driven by high vaccine uptake- meeting the WHO 75% target for flu vaccine in older adults, through evidence-driven decision-making, and early adoption of new preventive measures. Therefore, Ireland could develop Council Recommendations on the prevention of respiratory infections to send a strong signal of EU commitment to disease prevention, health system resilience, and preparedness. GSK supports the Steering Group on Prevention of Respiratory Infections’ call on the Council to make a new recommendation to Member States calling on them to: Invest in immunisation to meet current and future public health needs. Implement an annual EU-wide coverage target for COVID-19, RSV and pneumococcal disease using the influenza 75% target as a benchmark strengthen integrated surveillance and data collection by expanding influenza surveillance systems to include COVID-19, pneumococcal disease and RSV. Address vaccine miS/disinformation to strengthen vaccine confidence. Legislative Initiatives As the GPL is finalised it is imperative that a balanced, innovation-friendly regulatory framework, underpinned by sustained EU investment in biomedical research is supported. Such a framework will be essential for mobilising the scientific and industrial capacity needed to accelerate progress toward treating diseases e.g., ending HIV in Europe by 2030. Yet, under proposed changes to the GPL, innovators face fragmented regulation, uncertainty around incentives and rigid market access obligations, including disproportionate paediatric market-launch requirements for low-volume products like paediatric HIV treatments. The EU Biotech Act presents an opportunity for the Irish Presidency to address these barriers and improve regulatory flexibility by supporting needs-based market access pathways and offering alternatives to mandatory paediatric launches across all Member States with adult indications. Sufficient EU-level health funding should be a priority. The Presidency should ensure that the forthcoming Horizon Europe (Framework Programme 10) and European Competitiveness Fund within the next Multiannual Financial Framework allocate adequate resources for treatment, prevention, testing, and care services, including community-led responses for HIV, TB, hepatitis, and STIs. Securing sustained investment in health will be critical to protecting health, human rights, and social stability."
99,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9f98d0ac/GSK_-_Submission_99.docx,,Business,Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals,National,3,"The Presidency should promote health equity, inclusion, and community leadership with a focus on reducing inequalities in HIV, cardiovascular, respiratory and other infectious diseases. It can demonstrate how EU-level decisions translate into real benefits for citizens, businesses and communities. A Presidency narrative focused on prevention and health security will help citizens see the tangible value of EU cooperation HIV disproportionately affects marginalised groups, including LGBTIQ+ communities, migrants and women. Yet all along the prevention and treatment cascade key populations face significant barriers to accessing HIV services. (Lancet, 2020). Black women encounter particularly low access to PrEP due to stigma and systemic mistrust (Whelan et al., 2023). In 2023, migrants accounted for over half of new HIV diagnoses in the European Union (ECDC, 2025) , with an estimated 30% of these infections acquired post-migration (Mann et al., 2024). Reducing these disparities, including by investing in innovative, non-stigmatising options such as LAIs for HIV treatment and prevention, would improve health outcomes, strengthen workforce participation, and reduce healthcare costs. Embedding civil society and communities in policy development must also be a central pillar of the Presidency. Communities are best placed to design effective interventions, and their involvement leads to more accountable policymaking. The Presidency should therefore embed these principles and values in its policy agenda. Building on Spain’s 2023 Presidency, which placed HIV stigma elimination at the core of its health agenda, Ireland could go further by embracing a “nothing about us without us” approach. This would include embedding HIV considerations within broader EU frameworks such as the EU Gender Equality Strategy and the European Pillar of Social Rights. It could also encourage Member States to conduct equity impact assessments across health programmes, ensuring that EU policies actively reduce inequalities. A core impact of the Irish Presidency could come from actions that reduce time-to-treatment gaps and support predictable, efficient regulatory pathways. Embedding patient voices in HTA and regulatory processes ensures that innovation reaches people who need it most. Strengthening life-course immunisation will deliver major benefits—protecting citizens, reducing hospitalisations, preserving workforce productivity and supporting AMR strategies. The Adult Immunisation Board (a group of experts on Adult Vaccination) will hold their country meeting in Ireland during the Presidency; Ireland should support the Board meeting with a positive impact on adult vaccination. In addition to HIV, progress on disease-focused initiatives such as cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular health will drive earlier diagnosis, reduce health inequalities and support innovation ecosystems across Europe. Patient Advocacy Groups and industry could collaborate on events and position papers to achieve these aims and ensure the voice of the patient is heard throughout the Presidency. Ireland has an opportunity to demonstrate the regional impact of the life sciences sector, showcasing how the EU supports jobs, training and research capacity in all communities. Regional site visits during the Presidency and a Presidency associated event on cross-sectoral strategic resilience would further highlight how coordinated European action strengthens supply security, digital reliability and societal preparedness practical benefits citizens can understand and value."
99,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9f98d0ac/GSK_-_Submission_99.docx,,Business,Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals,National,4,"An effective Presidency will require clear communication of how EU membership improves daily life, strengthens health systems and supports economic opportunity. Citizens should see the Presidency not as a technical process, but as something that supports better health and stronger communities. Ireland should therefore adopt a clear narrative: “Better Health, Stronger Europe.” This connects EU cooperation with visible improvements in care, access, security and competitiveness. Regional engagement will be essential. Therefore, the government should consider site visits to pharmaceutical and life-science facilities, particularly in rural and regional areas, which will demonstrate how EU membership supports investment, employment and innovation across the country. Ireland should also facilitate citizen and patient-centred dialogues, including patient roundtables that highlight lived experiences and bring policymaking closer to the public. The Adult Immunisation Board meeting scheduled to take place in Ireland during the Presidency should be leveraged as an opportunity to progress dialogue with citizens and in Government on the multi- faceted benefits (health, social, economic) of immunisation and how Ireland can pioneer the establishment of a comprehensive adult immunisation programme. Digital storytelling can showcase practical examples such as improved vaccination coverage, earlier cancer diagnosis, AI-driven clinical decision support and secure medicine supply chains, helping people see how EU cooperation directly benefits their families and communities. Communicating the Presidency’s work on topics like Adult immunisation, HIV and strategic resilience will also help citizens understand how the EU safeguards critical supply systems, digital infrastructure and societal stability. An associated event grounded in resilience would offer a strong communications anchor for explaining the relevance of EU action. Working with stakeholders (including industry, clinicians, and patient organisations) will ensure the Presidency’s outreach is inclusive and nationally owned."

Europe must both (1) simplify and harmonise its digital rulebook so businesses can scale across borders, and (2) amplify AI adoption, ensuring citizens, public services and especially SMEs can deploy AI responsibly at scale. These two priorities should jointly underpin the focus on competitiveness, productivity and prosperity, and serve as the organising logic of the Presidency. Ireland’s Presidency should therefore adopt high-level themes that are future-oriented, people-centred and firmly aligned with these European Union-wide objectives. In alignment with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 and especially its Prosperous and Competitive Europe chapter, we recommend Ireland adopt the slogan: “Simplify & Amplify: Boost Skills, Innovation and Competitiveness”. Under this umbrella we propose three interlocking themes: i) Skills for a Future-Ready Europe: Building a competitive and cohesive Europe begins with people. Ireland can lead a Presidency theme focused on EU-level enabling actions that support and complement national efforts to equip citizens with digital and AI skills. Under this theme, the Irish Presidency could champion EU-supported frameworks for AI literacy and workforce reskilling, including: EU guidance on shared definitions and basic competency levels for AI Literacy that Member States may voluntarily adopt, champion ambitious, measurable targets for AI literacy and workforce reskilling, digital inclusion and mutual recognition of micro-credentials mapped to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) to ease cross-border skills mobility. ii) SME-Led Growth and Innovation: Europe’s long-term economic strength will depend on its ability to stimulate productivity, support innovation across all EU Member States, and unlock the benefits of technological transformation. Ireland can lead a Presidency theme focused on creating the conditions in which European firms, particularly its SMEs, can innovate, scale and compete globally. Under this theme, the Irish Presidency could champion SME-oriented guidance, mentoring networks, public-private programmes to ensure broader access to compute and public data, and modernised and open public procurement to spur demand. iii) A Coherent, Competitive Digital Single Market: Europe’s long-term competitiveness depends on a Digital Single Market that works smoothly across borders and supports innovation in every EU Member State. Ireland can champion a theme focused on making Europe’s digital landscape more coherent, interoperable and predictable for citizens, businesses and public administrations. Concrete deliverables under this theme should include championing horizontal and vertical simplification across GDPR, NIS2, Cyber Resilience Act, Data Act, DGA and the AI Act to name a few, and assert Europe's leadership in fostering international convergence of AI standards to reduce fragmentation while safeguarding European values and safety. In addition, we recommend that, if the Irish Presidency considers advancing new legislation, such as the Digital Fairness Act (DFA), it prioritizes a proportionate and targeted approach that addresses clearly identified gaps, while avoiding duplication or overlap with recently adopted EU legislation governing the online services ecosystem. The focus should remain on effective implementation and enforcement of existing rules, in line with Council conclusions calling for regulatory coherence and minimized administrative burden."
468,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ae6d425b/OpenAI_-_Submission_468.docx,OpenAI,Business,Artificial intelligence,,2,"The EU has set a clear ambition to lead on AI and secure competitiveness, productivity and societal benefits as reflected in the AI Continent Action Plan, the Apply AI Strategy and the Strategic Agenda 2024-2029. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council in 2026 provides a timely opportunity to support delivery of this ambition across the European Union. Ireland has particular strengths in digital skills, SME support, and innovation ecosystems, and is well positioned to drive progress in these areas for the benefit of all EU Member States. The Presidency should therefore prioritise two pragmatic, mutually reinforcing policy objectives: 1) Simplification and Regulatory Coherence; and 2) Amplification: Scaling Adoption, Skills and Infrastructure. 1. Simplification and Regulatory Coherence • Make 2026 the year of simplification: drive a Digital Fitness Check preparatory programme through a clear harmonisation mission to align definitions and reporting obligations. • Organize a “Simplification & Competitiveness Summit” in October 2026 (~ two-year anniversary of the Draghi Report) focused on delivering on the Digital Fitness Check and convene EU Member States, regulators and industry to fast-track commitments. Examples include a Single Reporting Portal, harmonised templates and a Digital Compliance Passport. • Advance vertical simplification: support a mandatory national Competitiveness & Consistency Assessments to limit gold-plating, create National Digital Regulation Helpdesks for SMEs, and stronger regulatory cooperation mechanisms. • Push for international convergence on HRAI and certification standards so European certification maps to ISO/NIST/CEN standards and the EU’s schemes are interoperable with like-minded partners. B. Amplification: Scaling Adoption, Skills & Infrastructure • Support voluntary, audacious EU-supportive targets the Presidency can champion: 100 million EU citizens provided with basic AI literacy including tools, open curricula and exchanges, and 10 million EU SMEs mentored/supported on their AI journey (targets to be advanced for the 2028-2034 budget cycle). • Champion an EU AI Productivity, Prosperity and Progress Summit in late 2026 (aligned with the EU Digital Summit) to align economic and social agendas: convening business, labour, academia and civil society to translate experimentation into measurable productivity gains. • Anchor Presidency initiatives in evidence-based policymaking by leveraging real-world data, assessing needs and outcomes, including adoption rates, productivity impacts, skills gaps and trust indicators to guide policy design, prioritisation and evaluation, and to ensure AI policies deliver tangible benefits for people and communities. • Coordinate EU Member States and EU AI Observatories and create a shared EU AI Readiness Index to benchmark skills, infrastructure, adoption and regulatory preparedness across Member States. Ireland should encourage national observatories to align metrics and share private-sector data. • Tackle infrastructure and access: mutual recognition of AI micro-credentials mapped to EQF; priority permitting for AI infrastructure; targeted public investment/subsidies to increase EU compute capacity; and fair access programmes so SMEs and public administrations can use shared compute resources. • Use AI as a tool for simplification: pilot GovAI sandboxes, AI-powered compliance assistants and multilingual regulatory triage tools for administrations across EU Member States. Cross-cutting measures should include: • Public procurement modernization to accelerate public-sector deployment of safe, effective AI. • A €1bn AI Accelerator Fund to support SME adoption, shared compute pools, regional AI hubs and reskilling. • AI Act: focus on proportionate, harmonised implementation with a strong emphasis on harmonising HRAI standards and certification."
468,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ae6d425b/OpenAI_-_Submission_468.docx,OpenAI,Business,Artificial intelligence,,3,"Ireland can maximise impact by ensuring that good digital policy translates into real economic growth, scientific progress and social benefit, boosting its global attractiveness and competitiveness. A central challenge during the Presidency will be navigating the evolution of Europe’s digital sovereignty agenda as it crystallises into concrete instruments, especially around the upcoming Cloud and AI Development Act (CAIDA) and the different initiatives to refine the definition of a sovereign cloud more broadly. Europe can and should strengthen resilience and local value-creation without closing markets or imposing nationality-based exclusion. As the European Parliamentary Research Service paper on the CAIDA noted, data centre capacity in the EU is insufficient, due to legal and financial constraints. Rigid, exclusionary rules could harm innovation and investment in Europe. Policy criteria should be capability, compliance and partnership, not ownership alone. Failing to do so or poorly designed measures would create a real risk of fragmentation of the Single Market, raising costs and weakening of Europe’s competitiveness. Key elements of how Ireland approach under its Presidency could include: Championing Council Conclusions that reject nationality-based exclusion as a default and affirm that sovereignty objectives should be pursued through objective, technology-neutral, capabilities and risk-based criteria. Promoting interoperability and equivalence pathways within EUCS and CAIDA so any trusted providers that meet EU technical, contractual and operational safeguards can participate without discrimination. Supporting procurement guidance that discourages blanket European preference rules and instead focuses on transparent scoring based on compliance, data governance, local partnerships and measurable local value. Facilitating policy dialogue with like-minded partners, drawing on models such as the “coopetition” approach to ensure digital sovereignty policies reinforce, rather than undermine, Europe’s openness and competitiveness. Ireland is uniquely positioned to act as an honest broker. A dedicated and open Digital Sovereignty & Innovation Forum during the Presidency could convene Member States, EU institutions, international partners, industry and civil society to define workable, objective criteria that balance resilience, competitiveness in a spirit of partnership and openness."

Ireland’s Presidency should place education, skills and opportunity at the centre of its public narrative. This includes: Framing the EU as a practical enabler of lifelong learning, mobility and opportunity through programmes that support digital skills, AI literacy and workforce transitions across all EU Member States. Highlighting concrete EU investments in education, research and innovation that deliver local benefits in schools, universities, SMEs and public services. In communicating the value of EU membership, the Presidency should acknowledge and celebrate the role of national education systems, and highlight how EU cooperation supports Member State leadership in skills development. Engaging young people directly through Presidency-branded initiatives focused on AI literacy, digital citizenship and future careers. Using accessible, citizen-focused storytelling to show how EU cooperation improves everyday life: better public services, safer technology, new job opportunities and global influence. We recognize that key policy areas such as formal education and workforce training primarily fall within Member State competence. Ireland’s Presidency should therefore focus on EU-level coordination, guidance, harmonization and support mechanisms that respect national prerogatives while enhancing cross-border cooperation and shared outcomes. By linking Europe’s values to tangible outcomes - skills, jobs and opportunity - Ireland can foster genuine ownership and confidence in the EU project."
468,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ae6d425b/OpenAI_-_Submission_468.docx,OpenAI,Business,Artificial intelligence,,5,"This submission summarises key messages from OpenAI’s EU Economic Blueprint and its contribution to the Digital Omnibus to AI regulation Proposal. Together, these contributions set out a practical agenda to strengthen EU competitiveness and productivity through AI, while ensuring responsible adoption and maintaining a coherent, innovation-friendly Single Market. First, both papers emphasise that Europe’s ability to capture AI-driven growth depends on scaling the foundations of AI-enabled prosperity: compute capacity, chip access, data availability, sustainable energy and talent. While the EU has made important early investments (e.g., EuroHPC, AI Factories and national infrastructure initiatives), the Blueprint argues that Europe must accelerate scale to meet rising demand. It proposes, among other measures, a major expansion of EU compute capacity by 2030, improved access to chips among democratic partners, faster growth in renewable energy to support digital infrastructure, and pan-European investment in AI education, research and workforce transition support. A central recommendation is to significantly expand AI literacy through scholarships, reskilling programmes and an “AI Erasmus”-style initiative, to ensure citizens and workers can benefit from new tools and jobs. Second, the papers argue that infrastructure investment must be matched by regulatory simplification, coherence and proportionality. Europe’s digital framework is increasingly complex and fragmented, creating a high compliance burden, especially for SMEs, and slowing cross-border scaling. The “Harmonizing” paper proposes five pillars for an ambitious simplification agenda. It calls for horizontal simplification to reduce duplication across regimes such as GDPR, NIS2, the Cyber Resilience Act, the Data Act, DGA and the AI Act, including a one-year harmonisation mission to align definitions and reporting, a Single Reporting Portal, harmonised templates, minimum implementation periods, and a Digital Compliance Passport to reduce repeated documentation. It also calls for vertical simplification to address divergent national implementation and enforcement through competitiveness and consistency assessments to limit gold-plating, national digital regulation helpdesks for SMEs, stronger regulatory cooperation, common open-data standards, and faster rollout of High-Value Datasets and Common European Data Spaces. Third, both papers underline that Europe’s economic opportunity depends on widespread adoption, not just technological leadership. The EU Economic Blueprint notes that AI uptake among European firms remains low relative to EU ambitions and stresses the importance of targeted SME incentives, modernised public procurement, and public-sector deployment to improve services and create demand. It proposes tools such as a European AI Readiness Index, mechanisms to share best practice, and an AI Accelerator Fund to support adoption, skills and regional ecosystems. Finally, both papers stress the importance of responsible, values-aligned AI. The Blueprint highlights safety and governance approaches (including preparedness and privacy-by-design) and proposes measures to strengthen youth protection, AI literacy and user empowerment, such as an EU Code on Child-Centric AI Design. The “Harmonizing” paper adds “SimplifAI”: using AI to make regulation and public administration more efficient through compliance assistants, multilingual support, and GovAI sandboxes.

As a small, open state deeply integrated into global digital markets, Ireland occupies a position unlike any other EU member: it is simultaneously a steward of European regulatory ambitions and the primary European host to major U.S. technology firms. This dual identity gives Ireland both the credibility and the responsibility to guide a balanced approach to safeguarding democratic participation online. A Presidency built on this theme would allow Ireland to articulate a vision that prioritises transparency, , and the preservation of open civic discourse, while resisting approaches that risk narrowing democratic space through excessive centralisation or overbroad regulatory intervention. By emphasising the need for proportionate, evidence-based digital governance, Ireland can champion a practical middle path—one that protects citizens from genuine harms without undermining the innovation ecosystem that sustains European competitiveness. Moreover, Ireland’s established relationships with U.S. companies allow it to act as an honest broker at a moment of increasing transatlantic tension over digital regulation. Rather than treating technology platforms solely as actors to be constrained, Ireland can encourage a cooperative model in which they are engaged constructively in achieving democratic resilience, supporting electoral integrity, and ensuring that content moderation systems respect fundamental rights. Embedding this vision across Council workstreams—ranging from internal market policy to justice, security, and foreign affairs—would position Ireland as a forward-looking, principled leader on digital democracy. Such an agenda would resonate with partners who share concerns about authoritarian influence, information disorder, and declining civic trust, while also reaffirming Ireland’s long-standing commitment to pluralism, openness, and rule-of-law governance."

Opposition to overreach in the proposed “ChatControl” framework, particularly as negotiations intensify during the Irish Council Presidency in 2026. This includes resisting any measures that would mandate client-side scanning or undermine end-to-end encryption; ensuring that child-protection objectives do not justify mass surveillance practices incompatible with fundamental rights; and promoting a Presidency-led approach that protects privacy, digital security, and the constitutional norms of free expression across the Union. Scrutinising forthcoming disinformation strategies and any renewed EU-level hate-speech initiatives—especially those expected to advance in 2026—to ensure they do not encroach upon legitimate expression. This includes guarding against vague or expansive definitions of “harmful” or “illegal” speech, preventing administrative overreach in enforcement, and maintaining clear protections for political speech, journalistic work, and civil-society activity. The above primarily fall under Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE) at a Council level. Together, these policy areas will shape the Union’s digital public sphere for years ahead.

First, Ireland can strengthen public trust in the digital environment by guiding the implementation of the Digital Services Act and related legislation in a way that protects free expression, ensures due-process guarantees, and enhances transparency in content moderation. Clear, rights-based implementation will benefit citizens by maintaining an open online sphere for debate, while giving businesses—especially SMEs—predictable, proportionate rules and reducing compliance uncertainty. Second, progress on secure digital infrastructure should be a central Presidency objective. Supporting the development of interoperable, privacy-preserving technologies—particularly in communications, cloud services, and data flows—would enhance competitiveness across the single market. By shaping negotiations on files such as the CSAM Regulation to avoid weakening encryption or imposing disproportionate surveillance obligations, Ireland can help safeguard cybersecurity for individuals and enterprises, enabling innovation rather than chilling it. Finally, the Presidency offers a strategic moment to reinforce Europe’s commitment to fundamental rights as the foundation of prosperity and stability. Embedding these principles across Council work—whether on digital policy, justice and home affairs, or economic files—will help ensure that technological progress and market integration translate into tangible improvements in daily life."

This divergence is most visible in regulatory frameworks like the EU’s Digital Services Act, which seeks to manage online content through extensive obligations on platforms. While well-intentioned, such rules can create systemic pressure on legitimate political speech and place private companies in the role of arbiters of truth—an approach viewed with deep suspicion in the U.S., where First Amendment protections run far deeper."

The European Commission is expected to present its EU Cardiovascular Health Plan in midDecember 2025. Consequently, the Irish Presidency will lead efforts in the Council resulting from the Cardiovascular Health Plan. As Cardiomyopathies Matter, we would like to see the Irish Presidency help in bringing attention to cardiomyopathies and other inherited cardiac conditions in the context of the EU’s cardiovascular agenda. Cardiomyopathies remain significantly underdiagnosed, unevenly managed, and insufficiently supported across Member States, despite affecting an estimated 1.5 million Europeans and often leading to severe complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death at young ages. The Irish Presidency has a strategic opportunity to elevate these issues within broader EU health policy. As an initiative, we advocate for stronger actions on early diagnosis and detection of inherited cardiac diseases like cardiomyopathies. The Irish Presidency should ensure that cardiomyopathies are explicitly referenced in the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. The Irish Presidency could also encourage the Commission and Member States to expand professional education on cardiomyopathies, deploy targeted awareness initiatives, and increase the use of cardiac imaging and genetic testing, especially in cases of sudden cardiac arrest or unexplained death in young individuals, where underdiagnosis remains a critical gap. Legislative work related to the implementation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) should be used to ensure that interoperable, privacy-compliant genomic and imaging data can be used to strengthen early detection across borders. Second, in the area of disease management and quality of care, the Presidency could push for EU-level benchmarking, improved data collection, and consistent application of clinical guidelines. Cardiomyopathies Matter calls for incentivising guideline-recommended management and integrating cardiomyopathies into broader EU cardiovascular monitoring frameworks. A flagship initiative could be progress toward a Cardiovascular Health Observatory, ensuring that rare and inherited cardiac conditions are visible within EU data systems and health indicator sets. Third, the Presidency could emphasise holistic patient support and empowerment. This includes supporting psychosocial services, rehabilitation, palliative care, peer networks, and digital tools that facilitate shared decision-making and access to personal health data. Strengthening patient involvement in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and research governance should also form part of Council-level work on patient-centred care models. Finally, the Irish Presidency should prioritise research and innovation, ensuring that existing EU projects and upcoming strategic research agendas embed cardiomyopathy-specific needs. A European Cardiovascular Health Data Knowledge Centre could be advanced through Council discussions on the European Health Data Space (EHDS) to unlock real-world evidence generation and address current fragmentation in registries and data infrastructures. The Presidency should also explore political support for establishing a long-term EU Cardiovascular Health Mission, modelled on the Cancer Mission, ensuring sustained funding and visibility for conditions that are not preventable but are highly treatable with coordinated action By leading on these priorities, the Irish Presidency can drive meaningful progress in cardiovascular health and significantly improve outcomes for people affected by cardiomyopathies across Europe."

The high level thematic priorities should include upholding the European Pillar of social rights and working towards the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda 2030. In particular, the eradication of poverty across Europe should be a high level thematic priority for its presidency of the council in 2026. The Irish Presidency of the EU will start just after adoption of the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy in Spring 2026. The Irish Presidency has a valuable opportunity to take a leading role in raising awareness of this new strategy, in promoting it and calling on commitments of all member states for its full adoption. This should include; ending homeless and ensuring access to adequate housing for all, ending all forms of discrimination including socio- economic discrimination, ending homelessness and ensuring equal access to quality services such as healthcare. It should also commit to genuine opportunities in education and employment, and ensuring a minimum standard of income which enables all to have their physical, social and psychological needs met. In order to achieve this Ireland should prioritise including the voice of lived experience during its presidency in policy, development, implementation and monitoring through diverse modes of inclusion and through the support of civil society organisations. To acknowledge the commitment to eradicate persistent poverty across Europe, the Council of Europe should recognise the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty- 17th October. 2025 marked 25 years of commemorating this day in Ireland."

See above for further details on what this should include. An effective anti poverty strategy is key to ensuring a free and democratic Europe, in line with the EU Strategic Plan 2024- 26. The EU council, should focus on supporting and development mechanisms for participation and consultation with civil society. Participative structures including diverse modes of inclusion, and genuinely listening to the voices of those experiencing exclusion is fundamental to strengthening democratic reliance and debate. It should be ensured that the digital transition and policies concerning the adoption of new technologies does not leave anyone behind. This can include older people and families and individuals experiencing poverty. A minimum essential standard of living for all across Europe is needed to ensure social and economic wellbeing. Further, to ensure a strong purchasing power of all citizens and tackling the cost of living across Europe. To achieve this, the called for directive on minimum income should be advanced. Ireland should prioritise EU action on housing and homelessness during its Presidency. Legislative action should be implemented which ensures quality, appropriate and safe and secure housing/ accommodation for all. Quality public services in healthcare, education, electricity and quality accommodation for all is essential to responding to crises. The importance of this was seen during the Covid 19 epidemic during which some groups were left further behind."

470,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a959678/Fair_Seas_Ireland_-_Submission_470.docx,Fair Seas Ireland,,,,1,"The Fair Seas supports the Environmental Pillar’s proposal that the Irish Government adopt “Resilience” as a core theme for Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026. Resilience is a unifying concept that cuts across many areas of EU work including climate and environment, energy security, social cohesion, economic stability, and democratic governance. It captures a growing recognition across Europe that, in a period of rapid change and increasing shocks, we must become more robust, more self-reliant, and better able to sustain progress within our own means. We believe that “Resilience” provides a comprehensive, constructive and forward-looking framing for Ireland’s EU Presidency. It reflects the need to strengthen the systems, institutions and infrastructure that support people’s ability to cope with rising uncertainty and volatility. It also aligns closely with the spirit of solidarity and community that citizens across Europe continue to demonstrate. Alongside “Resilience”, Fair Seas proposes “Ambition” as a second pillar of Ireland’s Presidency theme. Ambition is an essential thread running through the EU’s objectives across climate and environmental action, trade, defence and security, and the protection of democracy and European values. Together, Resilience and Ambition form a compelling and credible foundation for Ireland’s Presidency, one that would empower Ireland to lead confidently within the EU institutions in the period leading up to, and throughout, its term. In relation to the wider environment and particularly the marine environment, Resilience and Ambition offer a strong basis for genuine implementation, delivery and progress during the coming 12 months. These themes provide a clear mandate for Ireland to champion and support Member States in key areas of ongoing environmental work, including the development of ambitious National Nature Restoration Plans. They also underpin the collaborative efforts needed to meet the targets set out in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, including the commitments to protect 30% of EU waters by 2030, with one third of that (10%) under strict protection. By embedding resilience and ambition at the heart of its Presidency, Ireland can help drive the transformative changes required to restore and safeguard Europe’s marine and wider natural environment, while also speaking to the need for “Resilience and Ambition” across other important work priorities for the Council."
470,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a959678/Fair_Seas_Ireland_-_Submission_470.docx,Fair Seas Ireland,,,,2,"A priority focus area for Ireland’s Presidency of the Council in 2026 should be the stewardship of nature, with a particular emphasis on the marine environment. Ireland is well placed to encourage the effective implementation of existing EU marine and environmental legislation, including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Water Framework Directive (WFD), Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD), the Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR), and other related instruments. Ireland’s Presidency can help drive a renewed EU effort to translate these policies into tangible, positive conservation outcomes. By promoting a narrative that highlights the links between healthy, resilient seas and healthy, resilient communities, including benefits for well-being, coastal economies, climate mitigation and adaptation, and thriving marine industries, Ireland can demonstrate real leadership. This approach would support the delivery of ambitious environmental targets and commitments that all Member States, including Ireland, have already endorsed but have yet to fully achieve. In terms of specific policy areas, Fair Seas recommends that Ireland focus on the delivery of the EU-wide commitment to establish a coherent network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) across 30% of European waters by 2030. Although this target has already been agreed, many Member States including Ireland, are falling behind. Ireland’s upcoming national MPA legislation, currently being drafted to meet these obligations, provides a timely opportunity to align national ambition with EU-level leadership during the Presidency. If the EU is to achieve its 30x30 ambition, one area in need of urgent attention is the often poor implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives by Member States, and failure to deliver a network of Natura 2000 suites to properly protect species and habitats. Lack of effective management including the development of management plans, conservation measures, monitoring, enforcement and good governance represents a lost opportunity for the EU to take care of its marine ecosystems, species and habitats. In addition, the drafting of the EU Ocean Act, announced by Commissioner Sinkevičius and signalled in the EU Ocean Pact, may fall within the period of Ireland’s Presidency in 2026. This presents a unique opening for Ireland to demonstrate leadership on the effective protection and restoration of Europe’s marine biodiversity. Ireland can help shape a strong Ocean Act that provides the legal foundation, framework and statutory onus to effectively implement marine conservation policy nationally across Member States, something that has proven difficult to realise in the EU to date. Lastly, Ireland’s Presidency offers a chance to advance one of the most critical elements of the EU Biodiversity Strategy: achieving 10% strict protection of EU seas. This target is expected to be reinforced within the forthcoming EU Ocean Act. Championing strict protection would allow Ireland to signal its environmental priorities clearly, accelerate domestic progress, and inspire other Member States to raise their level of ambition."
470,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a959678/Fair_Seas_Ireland_-_Submission_470.docx,Fair Seas Ireland,,,,5,"Ireland should place the progression of marine conservation and Marine Protected Area policy at the heart of its focus on the environment during the EU Council Presidency in 2026. Ireland has already made significant commitments in this area, both at EU and global level, and the Presidency provides a crucial opportunity to demonstrate leadership, credibility and delivery. Ireland has committed to protecting 30% of its marine area by 2030, with this target embedded in the EU Biodiversity Strategy, which Ireland has endorsed, and which are reaffirmed in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (COP15). Ireland is also a signatory to the EU Ocean Pact, a political commitment to strengthen marine action across the Union. It is noteworthy that the Ocean Pact was first signposted on Irish soil during European Maritime Day in May 2025. Ireland’s Taoiseach highlighted its importance in his opening remarks in Cork, and travelled to France a short time later in June to officially publish the Ocean PAct alongside Commissioner Sinkevičius and President Emmanuel Macron. Ireland is therefore closely associated with the momentum behind this new EU-wide marine ambition. However, delivering on these commitments requires meaningful progress at national level. Despite repeated commitments over the past five years, Ireland currently ranks among the lowest-performing EU Member States in both the designation and effective management of MPAs. This gap between commitment and implementation undermines Ireland’s credibility at a time when the EU is looking for concrete action to match political pledges. For Ireland to hold the Presidency with authority on marine issues, it is essential that the Government advance strong, fit-for-purpose national MPA legislation in advance of 2026. Such legislation is critical to ensuring that Ireland can meet its 30x30 obligations, and it will provide a solid foundation for shaping wider EU policy conversations during the Presidency. Equally important is the need to improve the management and conservation effectiveness of Ireland’s existing Natura 2000 marine sites under the Birds and Habitats Directives. Without significant enhancement of implementation and enforcement within these existing sites, achieving a meaningful 30% MPA network will not be possible. Progressing MPA designation, management and wider marine conservation reforms is not simply a matter of compliance. It is an opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate genuine leadership at both national and EU levels, to build credibility as an advocate for ocean protection, and to show that Ireland can deliver on the commitments it has championed publicly. Doing MPAs properly, i.e., their designation and management is grounded in science, community engagement and effective and ongoing management, would position Ireland as a respected and ambitious leader during its EU Presidency. For these reasons, Fair Seas strongly urges the Government to prioritise marine conservation and MPA implementation as a core workstream in the lead-up to, and throughout, Ireland’s EU Council Presidency in 2026."

This has been accompanied by a hardening of government rhetoric, and efforts to roll back on and erode the protections enshrined in human rights frameworks, including the European Convention on Human Rights. This is evident most recently in the call by 27 Council of Europe members to weaken key protections under the European Convention on Human Rights. In parallel with this, and despite the significant, urgent and complex climate and environmental challenges facing the EU and wider world, there has been a concerted effort to weaken EU climate ambition and climate governance. In Ireland, this has most recently been reflected in moves to restrict access to justice in environmental matters. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union presents an opportunity to champion bold measures that advance fundamental rights and promote a socially just, ecologically sustainable society. In this context, and in line with the Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, we believe the high-level thematic priorities for Ireland’s Presidency should be as follows: The rule of law, with a focus on promoting and upholding the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Housing and homelessness, with a focus on progressing the commitment to effectively and urgently tackle the homelessness and housing crisis in Ireland and across Europe, by making affordable, sustainable, and decent homes available to everyone, and ensuring European social fairness. • Climate justice, with a focus on ambitious and measurable actions to reduce the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels and delivering long term solutions to our shared climate and social justice challenges; and promotion of access to information on the environment, public participation in environmental decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters in line with the Aarhus Convention."

Reflecting on how to navigate these challenges, he identified human rights law as the only credible roadmap for safeguarding human dignity. He noted that Ireland “has been transformed by judgments of the European Court of Human Rights” and “that the Court and the Convention have been the primary drivers for Ireland's social transformation into the confident and outward-looking society that it is today.” We call on Ireland to lead by example during its Presidency by: Upholding and affirming Ireland’s and the EU’s commitment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights. Advancing the essential reforms highlighted in the 2025 Rule of Law report, including reform of Ireland’s civil legal aid system to ensure access to justice for those who need it most. Protecting access to information on the environment, public participation in environmental decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters in line with the Aarhus Convention. Recognising the unique rights held by children and young people under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by supporting child rights-based access to justice. Housing People across Europe are struggling to find an affordable place to live, work, raise their families, and go about their daily lives. The housing crisis across the EU was expressly mentioned by President von der Leyen in her State of the Union Address 2025. Affordable housing has been identified as a top priority for the European Commission. In this context, Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union must prioritise: • Progressing the commitment to effectively and urgently tackle the homelessness and housing crisis in Ireland and across Europe, by making affordable, sustainable, and decent homes available to everyone, and ensuring European social fairness. Climate Justice Climate change is one of the greatest threats to human rights, posing a serious risk to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living of individuals and communities across the world. Ireland and all EU states have a legal and ethical duty to adhere to their obligations on climate change, to protect children, citizens and future generations from the most dangerous impacts of the climate crisis and to prevent the need for more abrupt and forceful action later. In April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found that Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights encompasses a right to effective protection by State authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life. With all 27 EU member states bound by the Convention, EU action must reflect this judgment. In this context, Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union must prioritise: • The EU’s 2040 target: CLM has called upon the EU to adopt a 2040 target which aligns with the best available science and the EU’s obligations under the Paris Agreement, and to avoid reliance on carbon credits. CLM recommends that the EU continue its practice of achieving its binding climate targets domestically for the 2040 goal, as already enshrined in the EU Climate law for the 2030 target and the 2050 climate neutrality goal. The EU has already faced significant challenges in regulating carbon credits due to poor quality, a lack of transparency, and potential for double-counting (where a credit is sold more than once). Carbon credits are increasingly subject to litigation – earlier this year, Energy Australia acknowledged that carbon credits do not mitigate dangers caused by greenhouse gas emissions and apologised to their customers for misleading advertising. CLM supported GLAN and CAN-Europe in its challenge to the adequacy of the EU’s 2030 climate targets as implemented by the EU Effort-Sharing Regulation. Judgment in this case is awaited. Adopting a 2040 target that aligns with climate science, as proposed by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, is critical to ensure an adequate target for 2040. It can furthermore provide long-term certainty for communities and Member States governments (at all levels), as well as the private sector and investors. Most importantly, it will ensure the delivery of a Just Transition, by protecting the rights of those most at risk from the worst impacts of the climate crisis. • Resource the Transition via the MFF: to ensure the effective and timely implementation of the European Climate Law, the transition must be adequately resourced across all member states. The European Commission has proposed that 35% of the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), which runs from 2028-2034, be ringfenced for climate and environmental measures. In its role as President of the Council of Europe, Ireland should use its leadership position to ensure that EU spending is aligned with the targets set out in the EU Climate Law, and that it drives a fast and fair transition."

Regarding our shared climate goals, the adoption of a 2040 target which is fully aligned with the best available climate science and consistent with the EU’s obligations under the Paris Agreement, supported by the effective resourcing of the EU’s transition across all Member States via the MFF, establish the foundation for a fast and fair transition. Ensuring that all member states are equipped to reduce their emissions at the scale and pace required could enable, for example: The equitable delivery of decarbonised homes that are cheaper and safer to heat; Improved public and active transport that prioritises connectivity and accessibility for all; An energy system that is resilient, sustainable and more cost-effective for all homes around Ireland; Food and water system transformation that protects human health and biodiversity; The creation of employment in the development of domestic renewable energy.

Disinformation, destabilisation tactics and geopolitical coercion directly threaten the stability of the Union. The strongest defence is not militarisation but a recommitment to the founding principles of the EU after the Second World War: peace, cooperation, democracy, human dignity and the rule of law. From this, three thematic priorities follow: Peace, Neutrality and the EU’s Global Credibility As a neutral state constitutionally committed to the peaceful settlement of disputes (Article 29), Ireland can place peace-building, mediation and preventive diplomacy at the heart of its Presidency. Peace is the foundation of prosperity and democratic stability. The EU must also apply international humanitarian law consistently and universally, both internally and in its external action. Selectivity weakens credibility; consistency strengthens it. Human Rights, International Law and Accountability A Europe that defends human rights and the rules-based order strengthens its own security. The Presidency should emphasise that the EU must hold itself to the same standards it expects worldwide. Consistent application of IHL—across all conflicts and regions—is essential to maintaining moral authority and global legitimacy. 3. Democracy, Transparency and a Free, Independent Media Democratic resilience requires a free media, open public debate and strong safeguards against disinformation and foreign interference. These tools protect the Union from external actors seeking to weaken democratic institutions. Ireland should champion the Media Freedom Act, journalist safety, and digital information integrity. Together, these priorities reaffirm the EU’s founding values at a moment when they are under unprecedented external pressure."

The most effective response is not to depart from the Union’s founding principles, but to return to them: peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and accountability. As a country with a long-standing policy of military neutrality and deep experience in peacekeeping and mediation, Ireland can help lead this re-centering. The EU’s credibility depends on acting consistently with its stated values—especially through the universal, impartial application of international humanitarian law. Selective adherence to humanitarian principles damages trust at home and undermines the EU’s global authority.

We strongly urge that the Presidency places the Circular Economy at the heart of its agenda, recognising its role in delivering climate neutrality, positive environmental impact, resource security, and competitiveness across the EU. This aligns with Ireland’s forthcoming Second Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy and the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, which prioritises sustainability, resilience, and digital transformation. In particular for our sectors, the ongoing revision of the WEEE Directive under the forthcoming EU Circular Economy Act is a critical legislative milestone.

See Website: https://www.wecareabouthearts.org/resilcard/the-project/",,,,1,"For its Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026, Ireland should prioritise “Health, crisis preparedness and resilience” as one of the high-level thematic pillars. This aligns closely with the Council of the European Union's 2024–2029 Strategic Agenda, which prioritises building a strong and secure Europe, and the European Commission’s recently launched Union Prevention, Preparedness and Crisis Response Plan (28 November 2025), which places resilience, security and crisis readiness at the forefront of the EU’s future direction. In particular, Ireland should champion efforts that strengthen resilience, preparedness, crisis prevention and response capacities across the Union, ensuring that the provision of essential care services is safeguarded and that citizens and societies are better protected against a broad spectrum of crises — from natural disasters to public health emergencies of any cause. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the significant and deleterious impact of healthsystems’ unpreparedness on essential care delivery. For cardiovascular disease — the leading cause of mortality in Europe — disruptions to care pathways resulted in severe consequences to patients, healthcare systems and wider society, as reported by We Care (Lunardi M et al. Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes. 2024 Jan 12;10(1):25-35. doi: 10.1093/ehjqcco/qcad025. PMID: 37286294). Building on these lessons, the RESIL-Card consortium has developed a resilience assessment tool designed to help European cardiovascular systems improve their preparedness, thereby ensuring the continuity of lifesaving care during future crises. By identifying vulnerabilities and supporting Member States in strengthening their healthcare pathways, this initiative will contribute directly to the broader EU objective of reinforcing health system resilience. With the roll-out of the RESIL-Card tool scheduled for Q1 2026, Ireland’s Presidency would come at a pivotal moment to promote EU-wide measures that enhance crisis preparedness in healthcare. In an era marked by increasing uncertainty and interconnected threats — any of which could trigger cross-border health emergencies — prioritising resilience under the theme of a “strong and secure Europe” would be both timely and strategically sound."

See Website: https://www.wecareabouthearts.org/resilcard/the-project/",,,,2,"To advance a stronger and more secure Union, the Irish Presidency in 2026 should prioritise policy areas that reinforce health system resilience, crisis preparedness and the continuity of essential care pathways. A key focus should be the development and implementation of EU-level policies that strengthen Member States’ ability to maintain lifesaving treatment during crises — particularly within high-burden disease areas such as CVD. The Irish Presidency could play an important role in ensuring that preparedness and care pathway resilience are systematically integrated into ongoing and future EU health initiatives, including those stemming from the Union Prevention, Preparedness and Response Plan and the broader European Health Union agenda. This includes encouraging progress on legislative proposals aimed at improving crossborder health-threat coordination, supporting national health system preparedness assessments, and embedding resilience considerations into EU funding programmes and national health reforms. Within this framework, Ireland could champion the uptake of tools that enable evidence-based preparedness planning. The RESIL-Card tool, which will be rolled out in 2026, offers actionable insights to improve the robustness of cardiovascular care pathways. By promoting the incorporation of the RESILCard results into policy discussions and Council conclusions, the Irish Presidency could help stimulate wider adoption across Member States, accelerating the strengthening of cardiovascular care systems capable of withstanding future shocks and rapidly adapting to emerging threats. In addition, the methodology underpinning the RESIL-Card tool provides an opportunity for broader system transformation. Demonstrating its applicability to other clinical specialties would support the development of a blueprint for system-wide health resilience, helping the EU move towards coherent, harmonised approaches to preparedness across different areas of care. The Irish Presidency could therefore encourage the Commission and Member States to explore pathways for scaling such a methodology beyond cardiovascular diseases, facilitating long-term EU cooperation on resilience planning. By prioritising these areas, Ireland could deliver concrete progress toward a more resilient European Health Union — one in which essential care remains uninterrupted, health systems are better prepared for crises, and citizens are better protected regardless of the challenges ahead."

See Website: https://www.wecareabouthearts.org/resilcard/the-project/",,,,3,"During the Irish Presidency, the Council can deliver substantial and lasting benefits for people, businesses and communities across the EU by prioritising preparedness and resilience of essential care pathways within national health systems. Advancing policies that strengthen the continuity and quality of lifesaving services — particularly during crises — would help protect patient outcomes while minimising the broader societal and economic consequences of disrupted care. Promoting preparedness in areas such as cardiovascular care, Europe’s leading cause of mortality, would support the development of more integrated and patient-centred healthcare systems across Member States. Such systems are better equipped to ensure equitable and timely access to treatment, even under severe strain. This approach would not only prevent avoidable deaths among those with existing conditions or heightened risk factors but would also reduce the long-term disease burden that constrains workforce participation, productivity and social cohesion. Businesses and communities would benefit from the increased stability that resilient health systems provide. Fewer disruptions to essential services mean fewer workforce absences, lower healthcare-related costs, and greater capacity for rapid recovery after emergencies — all of which enhance economic resilience and competitiveness. Strengthening care pathway preparedness therefore represents both a public-health priority and a strategic investment in Europe’s social and economic well-being. By placing health-system resilience at the centre of its agenda, the Irish Presidency can help the Council drive forward initiatives that tangibly improve the lives of citizens, reinforce the stability of communities, and support sustainable economic growth across the Union."

Wijns) of the European Society of Cardiology and has triggered the adoption of the ban in one European country after the other leading to massive benefit for the health of European citizens. A similar impact can be anticipated from the implementation of the RESIL-Card tool for preparedness, even beyond the cardiovascular sector through increased awareness, stakeholder engagement and activation of crisis management teams as well as stimulating resilience of the patient care pathways. Significant progress has already been made within the RESIL Card project and the tool is ready for dissemination for maximum impact. Engagement with key stakeholders has been established already in a number of countries including Ireland. The consortium met with Prof. Mary Horgan and team members on November 06,2025. Followup joint working sessions are planned and we believe that there is buy in to roll out the RESIL-Card tool at a regional level in Ireland, leveraging support on a national level through the NIPC.

Drawing on lessons from the exposure of critical vulnerabilities in cardiovascular care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, the RESIL-Card consortium has, over the past two years, successfully designed and tested a practical, evidence-based resilience assessment tool for cardiovascular care pathways. Developed through an inclusive and stepwise approach, as described in the appended methodological publication (https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.09.01.25334825v1), that fostered a strong sense of ownership among participants while ensuring the tool focused on actionability, the RESIL-Card tool empowers cardiovascular professionals to assess, strengthen and sustain the preparedness of their care pathways in order to withstand shocks and maintain continuity of lifesaving care during future crises, such as pandemics, climate events, resource constraints, and others. The pilot phase evaluated the functionality, usability and applicability of the RESIL-Card tool in real-world healthcare settings. Based on valuable feedback from European cardiovascular professionals regarding their experience of testing the tool, the consortium is now refining and optimising it in preparation for its widespread rollout across Europe in Q1 2026. Next year, targeted dissemination and engagement activities will reach the European cardiovascular community, public and patient organisations, as well as policymakers at both national and EU levels with the objective to foster the tool's broad adoption and integration into European health systems. As early results and stakeholder engagement have revealed a high level of interest in adapting the RESILCard tool for use in other clinical specialties - underscoring its potential as a model for system-wide health resilience - the RESIL-Card consortium is ready to engage in a collaboration with the relevant European stakeholders, and/or others, to extend the RESIL-Card approach to care areas other than CVD, thereby supporting the broader vision of making European health systems future-proof.

Our more detailed suggestions below serve Ireland’s two agreed high-level themes. Ireland’s Council of the EU Presidency falls at a key six month juncture for shaping the next iteration of the EU’s key instrument for financial investment in people and technology, the Multiannual Financial Framework, FP10. For funding, research, policy and regulatory development consistency, Ireland and its Presidency Trio’s work programme should be underpinned by cross-cutting and silo-breaking approaches to the existing European strategies on industrial competitiveness and intergenerational fairness. EU leadership in technology should be based on talent development, inclusive and strategic infrastructure investments. Intergenerational fairness in a tech-forward Europe requires more comprehensive and future-looking technology governance.

For intergenerational fairness to become a cross-cutting principle, pursue a coordinated, mainstreaming approach that avoids siloing it within the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYCS) Council. Instead, intergenerational fairness should serve as an anchoring principle for decisions across multiple Council configurations. EPSCO, ECOFIN, Competitiveness, Research and Environment Councils would each apply this lens within their policy domains, allowing the principle of intergenerational fairness to gain traction where decisions with generational consequences are made. Advance the Cloud and AI Development Act (CAIDA) and relevant funding instruments such as Horizon Europe and the Competitiveness Fund, both critical for strengthening Europe's AI capabilities and supporting breakthrough innovation in AI development and deployment. At the High-level Summit on AI that Ireland will convene in October 2026—""Enabling AI to Power Innovation-Led Growth in Europe"" : secure political commitment to prepare for the AGI-related risks and governance challenges expected in the coming years, ensuring Europe can navigate the AGI technological shift safely. Coordinate progress on Biotech Act I and Biotech Act II across relevant Council configurations (EPSCO for health and regulatory issues; the Competitiveness Council for industrial and research aspects). The EU Innovation Act should retain a strong biotech focus, drawing on Ireland’s regulatory expertise in the HPRA and its role within the EMA. Deepen EU cooperation with like-minded partners (UK, Canada, the African Union), creating the conditions to address climate-security challenges while leveraging Ireland and EU’s diplomatic strengths. The Presidency should launch early technical and informal discussions on the Energy Union governance revision, preparing member states ahead of the Commission's Q4 2026 proposal and aligning with the Green Deal goals on energy security and fossil fuel phase-out. Advance the Digital Fairness Act, launching early technical discussions and framing Council priorities ahead of the Commission's Q4 2026 proposal, ensuring consumer protection and democratic accountability are embedded in digital governance regulation. Strengthen effective enforcement of the key regulatory instruments enforced EU-wide: the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Data Act and AI Act. The Presidency could meet this objective by following up on previous Presidencies’ efforts with broad political high-level stocktake on implementation (e.g. this Danish Presidency effort) to inform Council discussions and complement the EU Democracy Shield. Relatedly, facilitate discussions across COREPER I and COREPER II on combating disinformation and misinformation - phenomena which impact European security at large and jeopardise trust in democratic instruments and institutions. • Facilitate progress on the 28th regime as part of broader and long-term competitiveness with careful consideration by EPSCO Council on labour rights implications.

Given Ireland's unique positioning in the global tech sector, it can demonstrate that Europe can lead in evidence-based decisionmaking and innovation while protecting people and businesses from the risks of rapidly evolving technologies through an approach that considers the long-term interests of European citizens. Developing effective policy for emerging technologies is inherently difficult, given their broad and often unpredictable impacts on people and businesses. To address this challenge, Ireland can actively facilitate broader stakeholder-led drafting of implementing rules as the preferred approach for technical provisions, building on the GPAI Code of Practice model that delivered clearer, more workable, and inclusive standards. For example, in Digital Omnibus trilogues, this method can resolve contested provisions by deferring technical detail to expert-led processes, ensuring workable outcomes that serve both innovation and public interest. The emerging trend among Member States to embrace tech diplomacy and science diplomacy and embed these within Council Presidency working party chairmanships as we saw under the Danish Presidency can unlock significant positive impact for the EU: it can build technology-based consensus in EU decisionmaking that carries through back in national capitals, to assure Council Presidency legacies in subsequent years. The European Framework for Science Diplomacy, co-created by scientists and diplomats, is a product worth further consideration by the Irish Presidency. The Framework’s specific recommendations merit attention during the latter months of 2026, milestone moments in MFF and Horizon Europe negotiations."

Recent developments, such as growing tensions with the current US administration, highlight the need to reinforce this legacy, making it even more important to communicate Ireland's contribution to fair, safe, and climate-aligned digital and emerging tech markets across Europe. The Irish Presidency should communicate EU membership benefits through concrete examples of responsible innovation that directly impact citizens' lives. To create genuine citizen ownership, Ireland should strategically guide the thematic focus of Eurobarometer surveys to ensure policy prioritization reflects citizens' real concerns, demonstrating that the Presidency responds to what matters to people. Measuring public urgency around climate interventions and perceptions of different climate technologies, informing the development of governance frameworks for climate intervention technologies. Gauging citizen views on neurotechnology applications to identify governance development opportunities that balance innovation with ethical safeguards. Assessing public understanding and support for SME-driven biotech innovation versus corporatedominated approaches."

This principle needs to actively shape agenda-setting and guide discussions within the Council across different policy and regulatory procedures, from AI governance and biotechnology frameworks to digital infrastructure standards. Intergenerational fairness principles will ensure today's decisions on emerging technologies create opportunities rather than vulnerabilities for current and future generations. This is particularly important for Europe's competitiveness as Europe can be competitive only if it ensures that emerging technologies serve the long-term interests of future generations. With Europe facing a narrow window to shape emerging technologies for intergenerational fairness, CFG advocates for three big, bold commitments requiring political will by consensus: embedding future generations into policymaking, building anticipatory governance capacity and making strategic choices about which technologies to accelerate. CFG stands for governing innovation - enhancing competitiveness today, and through long-term governance, securing fairness and progress for future generations. We believe these objectives to be aligned with Ireland’s approach to its upcoming Presidency of the Council of the EU, and we look forward to working with the Irish Presidency and the Trio programme it will lead on advancing this vision."

It would also help build strong support for the European Project at a time when the EU’s capacity and commitment to fairness and equality is coming under increasing scrutiny. Negotiations on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) will be continuing, if not concluding, negotiations during the Irish Presidency. We share the concerns of civil society organisations regarding the change from dedicated allocations and negotiations of the European Social Fund Plus, to a flat 14% threshold for ‘social funding’. There is a strong correlation between well-designed social expenditure and economic competitiveness. For this reason, sound social spending should not be viewed as compensation or an optional add-on but as a positive investment in the future that will create prosperity. The failure to ring-fence budgets for social inclusion, child poverty and material deprivation threatens accountability and impact. The Irish Presidency will occur at a critical time in the negotiations, and we hope will be able to resolve outstanding issues to ensure that the EU Budget will underpin the rights of its most vulnerable citizens. A strong focus on disability during the Irish Presidency resulting in EPSCO Council Conclusions/Recommendations would signal the EU’s commitment to advancing the rights of people with disabilities across the EU. An EU Council event in Ireland on the employment of people with disabilities would provide an important platform to engage with business and communities on the matter of inclusive employment."
452,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/8dce0f95/Rehab_Group_-_Submission_452.docx,,,,,4,"Despite a rise in Euroscepticism across Europe, the latest Eurobarometer survey shows that a majority of Irish people (59%) remain supportive of the EU. Given the current geopolitical climate of crisis and instability globally, it is crucial that the European Union remains rooted in and true to its founding values. The EU is often characterised as distant from the everyday lives of Irish people, and EU citizens more broadly. The Irish Presidency provides an opportunity to restate and reaffirm the benefits of our EU membership. Disability remains a prevalent issue in Ireland and across the EU. The inclusion of disability matters in the priorities of the Irish Presidency would be a strong signal of the EU’s commitment to vindicate the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens. The involvement of civil society organisations on an ongoing basis throughout the Presidency would ensure participation and engagement of citizens across the broad spectrum of Irish society. Civil society organisations bring a diverse range of opinions, economic backgrounds, and social circumstances. They can also help shape the political agenda for the Presidency and the EU by grounding the EU in the political desires and aspirations of its communities and citizens. A collaborative process of involvement between civil society, governments, and EU institutions would serve to strengthen support for the EU. It would assist in showing the EU to be transparent and engaging with citizens. Civil society could also help communicating the benefits of EU membership and of the priorities of the Irish Presidency. Where possible civil society organisations should be included and involved in official events organised throughout the Presidency. This would help ensure that planned events are relevant to the communities and sectors involved. Moreover, Presidency events should be organised across the four provinces of Ireland with a fair regional distribution. We understand that a number of Presidency Side Events are also planned. Again, the involvement of civil society organisations in such events will be central to their success. We would like to see several of these side events with a disability focus. The Communicating Europe Fund should be increased to enable more civil society organisations and local authorities organise specific events during the Irish Presidency. The Presidency must be inclusive and accessible at all levels to all people. Events should only take place in accessible venues and accommodation should be made for visually and hearing-impaired people. Communications/social media campaigns should be accessibility proofed."

Rehab Group is an independent voluntary organisation that has supported adults and children with disabilities for more than 75 years. As a campaigning and advocacy body, we represent the voices of the 12,500 individuals who currently access our services, as well as their families. Our mission is to empower those we support to live more independent lives and to participate fully in their communities. We achieve this through the delivery of high-quality, flexible, and sustainable services in care (RehabCare), education and training (National Learning Network) and employment (Rehab Enterprises). All across Ireland, RehabCare offers anyone living with a disability or disadvantage – young and old alike – the personalised, individual support they need to live their lives as fully and independently as possible. With more than 210 community-based services across the country, RehabCare provides personalised support for people of all ages and all abilities across a range of service models including accommodation services, respite, Day-services, outreach and home support National Learning Network (NLN) is a provider of inclusive education, training, and employment support for disabled people or people with additional support needs in every country in Ireland. NLN offers Universal Design informed, person-centred programmes that enable people to develop transversal skills, achieve qualifications, progress to further education and training, higher education, and get jobs. NLN is one one of eleven organisations to receive funding from the Government’s Digital and Assistive Technology Fund Rehab Enterprises is one of the largest non-governmental employers of people with disabilities. We work with a range of public and private sector partners in providing dynamic business solutions. Rehab Group can put forward people with lived experience of disability from across our three divisions to speak at Presidency events. Our advocates have experience presenting at local, national and EU events. They have appeared before Oireachtas Committees on Education, Employment, Transport and Disability Matters. Our Voter Education programme won the Aontas Star Award in the Learner Voice category in 2025 and recently featured in the European Association for the Education of Adults (EAEA) Enhance Podcast series. We have a number of subject matters experts available to speak on a range of disability matters including Care and Social Services, housing (including supported housing), education, training and skills development, assistive technology and employment. We have campaigned strongly on the issue of employment of people with disabilities. Our 2026 International Day for Persons with a Disability campaign “More than a Job” focussed on the issue of inclusive employment and the campaign video features staff from Rehab Enterprises, students from National Learning Network and a range of employers that we work with such as Mr Price, Gaelite Signs and Mitie in Dublin Airport.

348,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9bfdad95/Wind_Energy_Ireland_-_Submission_348.docx,Wind Energy Ireland,,,,1,"Proposed Theme: ""Driving Competitiveness, Delivering Climate Action"". Rationale: Competitiveness: The Draghi Report identifies high energy costs (2-3 times higher in the EU than the US or China) as a critical threat to European industry. Rapidly deploying indigenous renewables is the only viable solution to lower these costs and restore competitiveness. This Presidency must therefore pivot from setting targets to removing the barriers, specifically grid bottlenecks and permitting delays that prevent the deployment of clean energy. Climate Action: This theme directly reflects the urgency highlighted by the Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment, Darragh O'Brien, in his statement following the conclusion of COP30. Noting that the COP30 text ""falls short of meaningful ambition,"" the Minister emphasised that the fight for a ""fair, effective, and ambitious global response"" must now be taken forward to COP31 under the Irish Presidency. He stated clearly that ""that work begins now"" to deliver a credible roadmap for the phase-out of fossil fuels. Benefit for Ireland: Leading this agenda positions Ireland as a pragmatic leader in the global energy transition. It ensures that the EU policy direction aligns with Ireland's national objective to achieve energy independence and directly addresses the electricity price volatility caused by our reliance on gas."
348,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9bfdad95/Wind_Energy_Ireland_-_Submission_348.docx,Wind Energy Ireland,,,,2,"We propose four priority areas, each backed by specific legislative files and Presidency actions: Priority 1: Upgrading Europe’s Electricity Grids Legislative Focus: The European Grids Package (expected late 2025) and TEN-E Regulation. Presidency Actions: o Binding Timelines: Secure agreement on the Grids Package with binding permitting deadlines to resolve the bottlenecks currently stalling renewable deployment. Anticipatory Investment: Champion reforms to allow grid build-out ahead of demand rather than lagging behind. IPCEI for Grids: Lead a coalition to establish an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) for electricity grids to unlock large-scale cross-border investment. Benefit for Ireland: Grid congestion is the single biggest barrier to Irish renewables. A strong EU Grids Package will unlock projects like the North-South Interconnector and allow Ireland to export its surplus wind energy, turning a potential waste of resources into a revenue stream. Priority 2: Accelerating Electrification Legislative Focus: The Electrification Action Plan (Q1 2026) and Guidance on Network Tariffs. Presidency Actions: o Tariff Reform: Drive the adoption of dynamic, time-varying network tariffs that reward consumers for using clean energy when it is abundant. Flexible Connections: Promote the implementation of flexible connection agreements (under Directive EU 2024/1711) to faster connect heat pumps and EVs. Benefit for Ireland: Electrification is key to reducing Ireland's €3.3 billion annual spend on imported fossil fuels. It will also support the competitiveness of Irish industry by enabling them to access lowercarbon, lower-cost power – increasingly important for attracting FDI. Priority 3: Accelerating Permitting Legislative Focus: RED III Implementation and the Omnibus Package. Presidency Actions: o Best Practice Conference: Host a high-level EU conference on ""Permitting Best Practice,"" showcasing solutions like One-Stop Shops and digital permitting platforms. Implementation Drive: Support the Commission in monitoring RED III compliance to reduce the administrative burden that currently delays projects. Benefit for Ireland: Faster permitting de-risks the project pipeline for onshore and offshore wind, ensuring Ireland meets its 2030 climate targets and maintaining investor confidence in the Irish market. Priority 4: Embedding Flexibility Legislative Focus: Electricity Market Design (EMD) and the 2026 White Paper on Market Integration. Presidency Actions: o Flexibility Assessments: Lead by example by delivering Ireland’s National Flexibility Needs Assessment early. Engagement on this must start now. o Future Market Design: Shape the Council’s debate to ensure market rules value non-fossil flexibility services like Long Duration Energy Storage. Benefit for Ireland: Flexibility prevents waste. Energy storage could save Irish consumers up to €85 million annually by 2030 and reduce the ""dispatch-down"" (curtailment) of wind energy, ensuring we get maximum value from our natural resources."
348,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9bfdad95/Wind_Energy_Ireland_-_Submission_348.docx,Wind Energy Ireland,,,,3,"We recognise that the Presidency must act as an ""honest and neutral broker"" and cannot prioritise specific national interests over the Union’s needs. However, the challenges of high energy prices and infrastructure deficits are shared by every Member State. Therefore, while respecting the constraints of the office, we encourage Ireland to push ambitiously for delivery on the following shared European goals, which will have a substantial positive impact on citizens and businesses: Cutting Bills, Not Just Carbon: The most tangible impact for citizens is reduced energy costs. Renewable electricity saved Irish consumers nearly €1 billion between 2000 and 2023 and cut bills by €320 per person during the energy crisis. By focusing the Council’s work on delivery (specifically grids and permitting), the Presidency can structurally lower prices across the EU, replicating these savings for families Europe-wide. Energy Security: Accelerating the build-out of indigenous energy infrastructure reduces exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets. Gas prices dictated electricity costs 80% of the time in Ireland during the crisis, despite only generating 40% of our power. Breaking this link through rapid infrastructure delivery is the most effective way to protect EU citizens from future geopolitical shocks. Competitiveness: For businesses, a focus on the Clean Industrial Deal and affordable power is essential for survival. As the Draghi Report highlights, European electricity prices are 2-3 times higher than in the US or China. Lowering these costs through grid upgrades and electrification will prevent de-industrialisation and support the creation of green jobs across the continent. Benefit for Ireland: Protecting Irish households from future global energy price shocks is a primary national interest. Additionally, a secure, green energy system makes Ireland an attractive location for energy-intensive Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). While we understand the limitations of the Presidency role, we urge the Government not to view ""neutrality"" as passivity. Ireland should confidently lead the charge on Grids, Permitting, and Electrification, knowing that this agenda is not just a national priority, but an existential necessity for the entire European Union."
348,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/9bfdad95/Wind_Energy_Ireland_-_Submission_348.docx,Wind Energy Ireland,,,,4,"Mirroring Pillar 4 of the Accelerating Infrastructure Action Plan (Public Acceptance), the Presidency should highlight how EU policies fund local wins. Here are a few ways in which this could be done: Interactive ""Action"" Events: Instead of abstract policy meetings, the Presidency should host a major ""Accelerating Permitting"" conference involving civil society to discuss how renewable projects deliver local benefits. Local Benefits Focus: Communication should highlight how EU directives support Community Benefit Funds and how renewable projects contribute local rates to County Councils, directly funding community services. Showcasing Irish Success: Use the Presidency to Host ""Energy Innovation Days"" to showcase local success stories and progress being made in across the energy transition. Benefit for Ireland: Increased public engagement fosters ""social licence"" for essential infrastructure. By clearly linking EU policy to local economic wins (jobs, community funds), we can reduce local opposition to the grid and renewable projects required for Ireland’s future."

Uber is proud to operate in Ireland with both taxi services and food delivery with Uber Eats. At Uber, our mission is to create opportunity through movement across Europe. With operations in 24 EU countries,including Ireland, and over 3,000 cities, we enable millions of people to move, earn, and access the goods they need daily—linking passengers and consumers with hundreds of thousands of drivers, couriers, and local merchants. In 2024, Uber and Uber Eats generated over €24 billion in economic value in the EU, supporting entrepreneurship, SMEs, and local communities across the continent. The 2026 Commission Work Programme clearly underscores the need for Europe to strengthen its competitiveness, and accelerate the green and digital transitions. In order to deliver on these ambitions, it is vital that the EU can harness the true potential of the Single Market to secure its future prosperity Uber recommends that during its Presidency, Ireland focuses on realising the recommendations of the Letta and Draghi reports, and prioritises three interconnected efforts to boost the competitiveness of the EU’s Single Market and emphasis measures which break down barriers holding economic growth, improved consumer choice, and technological innovation and uptake. Specifically, we suggest that Ireland further addresses regulatory fragmentation within the Single Market, fostering the consistent and uniform enforcement of regulation across the EU, and continue to explore regulatory simplification efforts to address inconsistencies, duplication and overlaps in regulation and reporting requirements. By leveraging its Presidency, Ireland can help steer Member States toward examining potential domestic Single Market barriers to competition, especially those within the “Terrible 10.” Ride-hailing and taxi are already governed by a comprehensive body of EU legislation designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and strong consumer protection in the digital economy. However, these services have also been regulated through a patchwork of municipal and regional rules across Europe. Many of these regulations are disproportionate, discriminatory, outdated in the context of rapidly developing technologies and pose barriers to the Single Market. This fragmentation prevents innovative companies, start-ups, and investors from benefiting from the scale, level playing field and legal certainty that the EU Single Market should provide, limiting their ability to grow and offer a seamless service to citizens. This will impact the 190 million Europeans expected to use ride-hailing services by 2030. The Irish Presidency is best placed to advocate for the removal of intra-EU barriers in order to ensure modern economic governance frameworks which can help reinforce the productivity and prosperity of millions of Europeans. The cost of inaction is clear: regulatory uncertainty and fragmentation slow or prevent frustrates the development of innovative services, deters investment, and diverts valuable resources away from innovation to compliance, ultimately raising the costs for producers, operators and consumers, and damaging Europe’s economic competitiveness. A 2025 Ricardo plc study shows that harmonising rules for the ride-hailing sector could deliver significant benefits, including job creation, lower emissions, and higher revenues: Up to 219k new jobs across six cities alone Up to 29% reduction in CO₂ emissions by removing rules that cause empty rides ● 11% increase in trip revenues by lifting price restrictions While the European Commission has committed to address the issues ride-hailing and private hire vehicles are facing in 2 out of 3 Member States, we ask that the Irish Presidency to call for the sector to be a priority to bridge the gaps of the Single Market. At Uber, we look forward to collaborating with the Irish Presidency on these important issues."

The Irish Council Presidency can play an important role in encouraging coordinated progress among Member States and ensuring that work across these critical files contribute to a more competitive, resilient and dynamic European economy. We at Uber would highlight the below two policy priorities as particularly relevant for the upcoming work of the Irish Presidency. Streamline digital regulation. Uber is proud to offer shared mobility and delivery services, providing opportunities to hundreds of thousands of drivers and couriers to generate revenues, to restaurants to grow their business, and safe convenient travel for passengers and customers. As a hyperlocal player on the ground providing services for millions of EU citizens, we operate under a broad evolving set of regulations, spanning digital policy, sustainability, labour, cybersecurity, data, AI, and safety, giving us a unique regulatory perspective. The ongoing EU focus on simplification, as underscored in the 2026 Commission Agenda and the Digital Omnibus, offers a timely opportunity to reinforce the Single Market and spur on digital innovation in Europe. Specifically, we would call on Ireland during its Presidency to continue to work on addressing regulatory misalignments, such as the contradictory definition of “automated systems” between the GDPR, AI Act, and the Platform Work Directive (Chapter III), overlapping reporting obligations, and the need for better coordination among supervisory authorities to ensure consistent enforcement, avoid conflicting requirements, and provide legal certainty for businesses. Simplification will help ensure strong consumer protection while preserving business agility, resilience, and boosting innovation. Prioritise the electrification of professional fleets. Setting clear, binding targets for corporate fleets in the forthcoming EU Clean Corporate Vehicles proposal, will help to stimulate demand and create a virtuous cycle across the broader European automotive ecosystem. Decarbonisation is a team effort, and it is only through establishing unambiguous objectives that all stakeholders, including ride-hailing platforms, can we reach our common goal. This approach will allow for a shared responsibility across the value chain, ensuring that all companies operate under the same clear targets as part of a broader level-playing field within the Single Market. Time is of the essence to meet European environmental and economic goals, and Ireland’s Presidency will be crucial in delivering on this legislation to help realize the significant emissions reductions needed by the transport sector by 2030. Without a unified EU framework, the existing patchwork of national approaches risks creating uneven progress across the internal market and an uneven playing field for companies investing in decarbonisation."

A practical example could be shepherding measures in Council to realise the recommendations of the 2030 Consumer Agenda such as completing the Single Market for Consumers, in particular with actions to address the private hire vehicle sector. Harmonised rules for the ride-hailing sector would concretely improve European consumers experience, notably: reduced waiting times when booking a trip; convenience and reliability thanks to consistent experiences in all cities they visit; ● affordable prices and ability to compare mobility options upfront; ● more accessible mobility options when travelling. Moreover, the Irish Presidency can also have a crucial role in shaping the debate around the presentation of the upcoming Digital Fairness Act and the revision of the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) regulation. Preserving a balance between further protecting consumers and enabling businesses to develop pro-consumers innovative features will be key. The DFA should focus on harmonisation and simplification, instead of duplicative or prescriptive rules that could restrict innovation in favor of consumers. For example, further restrictions on personalisation or app design could impact features that consumers love: these practices are necessary to recommend restaurants or discounts on Uber Eats."

Ireland should leverage proposals such as the 2025 Consumer Agenda as part of broader public engagement which goes beyond capitals, and engages local and community organisations. Policy-focused roadshows across Ireland and the EU hosted in conjunction with local authorities, universities, youth organisations, and business networks during the Presidency can help to foster a greater sense of ownership where citizens can contribute and be involved in policy debates. Moreover, formal and informal public consultations can help to ensure that citizens’ inputs are acknowledged and reflected in policy positions. Ireland is a pioneer in this field with the Citizens’ Assembly models, which could be replicated across the EU. In addition, a Presidency that communicates openly over timelines and implications for potentially critical files for citizens and business, and which can demonstrate progress step-by-step will further reinforce the clear value of EU membership for citizens. By keeping citizens at the centre and delivering visible results, Ireland’s 2026 Presidency can strengthen public confidence in the EU and cultivate a genuine sense of shared ownership and pride."

Europe needs to focus on addressing its competitiveness. Occurring at the midpoint of the legislative cycle and two years post-Draghi report, this Presidency offers a strategic opportunity to correct Europe’s trajectory by shifting focus from creating new rules to implementation, coherence, and enforcement. Regulatory Simplification and Excellence: Ireland must continue to champion the spirit of the ""Digital Omnibus"" process to keep the focus in Europe on supporting innovation and addressing the unprecedented volume of over 100 recent digital laws. New proposals must be evidence-based, risk-based, and accompanied by economic impact assessments. Regulation should only be introduced where proven gaps exist. The Presidency should ensure the EU continues its efforts towards clarifying overlaps in files like the AI Act, Data Act, and NIS2.0, and addresses enforcement overlaps between national authorities and the Commission, particularly regarding the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Drawing on the call from 20 Heads of State, the Council should ensure EU digital rules are effective, proportionate, and fit for the future. The EU AI Act: A balanced copyright framework is vital for a thriving AI ecosystem. The EU’s current approach, while less permissive than the US, Japan, or Singapore, offers a reasonable balance between innovation and rights protection. Existing exceptions for text and data mining are critical for competitiveness and must be maintained. However, European leaders like Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi are questioning the current trajectory. A renewed approach is essential to prevent Europe from falling behind. The EU AI Act must mandate regulators to promote innovation. The current High-Risk framework draft is confusing and lacks legal certainty. Furthermore, the General Purpose AI Model regime is redundant as it duplicatively regulates both upstream and downstream activities. Online Safety: The Irish Presidency must ensure proportionate, harmonized rules for children's online safety to ensure enforceability and avoid Member State fragmentation across files like the DSA and AVMS Directive. The proposed Digital Fairness Act (DFA) should not create new burdens but complement existing rules. Ireland should promote harmonized age assurance methods that balance risks to minors with user privacy and rights. Privacy Framework (GDPR & e-Privacy): Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) should promote a balanced approach supporting both data protection and economic growth. The confirmation that ‘legitimate interest’ is a legal basis for AI training is welcomed, aligning with recent guidance and providing predictability. However, concerns remain regarding drafting elements that contradict Large Language Model (LLM) technical limitations (e.g., unconditional right to object). The Digital Omnibus should better incentivize Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Regarding cookies, the current proposal for browser-level consent is unworkable and fails to meet GDPR standards. Article 88b creates uncertainty for ad-funded models and should be deleted. Instead, Article 88a should be expanded to exempt low-risk data uses (e.g., contextual ads) to reduce banner fatigue. Digital Fairness Act (DFA): The proposed DFA contradicts simplification efforts by introducing rules in areas already covered by existing laws. Ireland should advocate for ""self-restraint"" in new legislation, as called for by 20 Heads of State. The DFA risks over-regulation and duplicating efforts in areas like personalized advertising. The Commission should focus on enforcing rules against proven unfair practices rather than creating a complex regulatory patchwork that threatens the ad-supported internet. EU Quantum Act Ireland should advocate for a European Quantum Act modelled on the Chips Act, prioritizing funding, infrastructure, and supply chain monitoring rather than regulating the technology itself. The focus should be on R&D investment, facilitating industrialization, and streamlining funding access. EU Batteries Regulation: To avoid a compliance shock in 2027, strengthened engagement with stakeholders is needed. A targeted delay in the application of Article 11 is supported to allow time for processing derogation requests and for manufacturers to incorporate requirements into product cycles. Please note that Technology Ireland has submitted an additional paper to the Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to this consultation which is summarised in Question 5."
328,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/159df772/Technology_Ireland_Ibec_-_Submission_328.docx,"Technology Ireland, Ibec",,,,3,"The Council of the European Union should ensure it pushes further on the work ongoing in terms of regulatory simplification to support European competitiveness. It should also ensure that in relation to files such as the Digital Fairness Act (DFA), duplication of regulatory efforts is avoided especially when proposals are already contained within the scope of existing rules. Business needs a predictable, consistent regulatory approach which supports innovation. The EU’s digital rulebook has become a barrier to investment due to complex, overlapping rules and fragmented interpretations across Member States. The Council should leverage the Digital Omnibus process to progress the review of this framework, ensuring that competitiveness and innovation are embedded in the legislative process. Rather than introducing new burdens, the focus should be on clarifying existing legislation and addressing the ""patchwork"" of national interpretations. The Presidency should host thematic discussions within the Council Working Party on Competitiveness and Growth to resolve issues like overlapping enforcement between national authorities and the European Commission, particularly regarding the Digital Markets Act (DMA). New regulation should be introduced only where gaps are proven and must be subject to a high threshold of necessity. Europe should avoid over-regulation in future proposals, such as the Digital Networks Act (DNA), by resisting unnecessary rules on cloud services or interconnection where competitive markets already exist. Conversely, the New Legislative Framework (NLF) offers an opportunity to modernize compliance by digitising product labels, maintaining standards while simplifying information for consumers and businesses. Despite the Draghi report’s pro-competitiveness recommendations, a significant gap remains between political commitment and implementation. Future proposals must be evidence-based, risk-based, and proportionate, accompanied by rigorous economic impact assessments. The priority must shift from adding to the acquis to enforcing existing rules, allowing Member States time to implement recent files like the AI Act, Data Act, and NIS2.0. Addressing the confusing intersection of these rules is vital for a predictable environment. Furthermore, legislative reviews should clearly distinguish between B2B and B2C risks. Finally, regulatory simplification must be paired with financial reform to unlock innovation and the Council has a role here. A lack of investment is a major barrier for EU SMEs. Ireland should advocate for a Capital Markets, Savings, and Investment Union to diversify funding beyond bank lending. Unlocking savings, pension funds, and private wealth is essential to financing the twin green and digital transition and improving the EU's economic resilience.

Ireland should leverage partnerships including the D9+ to advocate for a focus on enforcement of existing rules, an emphasis on allowing business space to innovate and on forbearance when it comes to designing new digital regulatory rules. Ireland should retain the D9+ focus on openness as a driver of EU competitiveness and innovation, including in relation to an open model for digital sovereignty, resisting protectionist policies and creating the conditions for European industry to access and partner with the best technology solutions in AI and cloud. We welcome Europe’s outward-looking approach to digital sovereignty, as seen with the recent Berlin Declaration, which seeks to strengthen Europe’s digital capabilities while preserving access to open markets, interoperability and international collaboration with partners who share European values. The emergence of the D9+ has been a welcome development in the past few years in advancing the needs of digital front-runner nations at an EU-level. The Dublin D9+ Declaration in April 2024 reinforced the need for coherence, innovation and implementation for the EU’s digital rulebook. The broader EU-US economic relationship should be prioritised during Ireland’s Presidency, particularly in fast-moving areas like AI. Ireland has a unique relationship with the US and should ensure this is brought to the fore during its Presidency term to strengthen EU-US ties. Brings together policymakers and industry during its planned AI Summit to focus on AI opportunity. This will be positive for business, citizens and society across Ireland. On an all-island basis, Ireland and Northern Ireland are home to so many of the world’s leading technology organisations and with their deep links to the EU, US and a wider global network of pro-enterprise minded regions, are in the perfect position to convene an international summit on AI. We understand that, along with a number of other plans, Government now intends to host an AI Summit in October 2026 during the period of Ireland’s Council of the EU Presidency. Industry remains available to support with making this a success. The summit should look at how regulation can work with innovation and opportunity to ensure Ireland and Europe keep pace with global partners on AI adoption. Government should promote the integration of Europe’s semiconductor capabilities into the emerging technology frontiers of AI computing, to reflect the latter's critical dependency on the former’s capabilities. Coordinating AI developments and roadmaps with Chips Act 2.0 will be essential to building a coherent, resilient, and globally competitive European technology ecosystem. The planned AI summit would be an excellent opportunity to address this dependency. Government should recognise that essential to embedding AI adoption is ensuring access to upskilling and reskilling opportunities across the country. This includes leveraging the National Training Fund to bolster digital and AI skills across the workforce and ensuring additional funding for the industry-led Skillnet networks training model. To accelerate adoption and innovation, we propose the creation of an AI Transformation Fund (AITF). Moreover, support for sectoral AI sandboxes will be crucial for training regulators and industries to develop products and services that are ready for the AI Act.

Technology Ireland views the 2026 Presidency as a critical ""inflection point"" for the EU. Occurring two years after the Draghi report and at the legislative cycle's midpoint, the Presidency must correct Europe’s trajectory by pivoting from creating new rules to supporting implementation, simplification, and coherence. Following an ""unprecedented volume"" of over 100 recent digital laws, the EU digital rulebook has become a barrier to investment. Ireland must act as a ""regulatory hub,"" championing the ongoing Digital Omnibus process to review this framework. New rules should only be introduced where gaps are proven. Use the New Legislative Framework (NLF) to digitize product labels, simplifying compliance. Focus on enforcing existing laws rather than adding to the acquis. The Presidency should address overlapping enforcement between national authorities and the Commission, particularly regarding the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Ireland should convene an AI Summit in 2026, bringing together policymakers and industry. Ireland must advocate for a Capital Markets Union and create a domestic AI Transformation Fund (AITF). Leverage the National Training Fund to bolster digital skills. Mandate ENISA to conduct independent cybersecurity impact assessments for all new legislation. Regarding the Digital Networks Act (DNA) and other future proposals, avoid introducing over-regulation, such as proposals for regulating cloud services or introducing interconnection rules where a competitive market already exists. The DNA should also strive to sustain and strengthen the EU Single Market through the Country-of-Origin principle, particularly for services that are already offered on a pan-European basis. Ensure Chips Act 2.0 funding is accessible to Northern Ireland-based companies. AI Act: Maintain the current copyright balance (text/data mining exceptions). Regulators must have a mandate to promote innovation. The redundant ""General Purpose AI Model"" regime should be addressed. Privacy (GDPR/e-Privacy): Support ""legitimate interest"" as a legal basis for AI training. Digital Fairness Act (DFA): The DFA is an example of over-regulation that duplicates existing rules (GDPR, DSA) and creates uncertainty. Online Safety: Promote harmonized age assurance methods to prevent Member State fragmentation. Quantum: Advocate for a European Quantum Act modelled on the Chips Act. It should focus on infrastructure and funding, not on regulating the technology itself. • Batteries Regulation: Support a targeted delay of Article 11 to prevent a 2027 compliance shock, allowing manufacturers time to adapt."

The presidency provides strategic political direction on policies and objectives for the common good of the EU 27 members and its residents, and this shall align with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024 – 2029. Iarnród Éireann suggests the following priorities should be included and progressed across the EU27, with Ireland well placed and experienced to provide direction and leadership in these matters. Housing Focusing and aligning the delivery of housing around rail corridors with high frequency, reliable and fast services which support densification, Transport Orientated Development, and sustainable living. This is a key priority across many European countries, as like Ireland, they seek to respond to housing demand. Connectivity The EU has ambitious plans to better connect across the continent through fast, comfortable, safe, and reliable rail services, with more and enhanced connections to bring us closer together. These include the development of a comprehensive network of high-speed rail corridors across Europe, as launched by the European Commission in November 2025, reducing bottlenecks, enhanced cross-border connections along TEN-T corridors, air and seaport connections and improved systems in urban nodes. European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) Upgrading and replacing multiple national rail systems to a single standard across European transport corridors is a priority for EU stakeholders. This allows trains to cross borders without changing signalling equipment, enhancing safety, interoperability, and competitiveness, while promoting a single European railway area. Rail Electrification Accelerating the electrification of railways will assist Europe with the objective to become the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050 and a commitment to reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Ireland can champion that climate leadership during its presidency. This will require leading by example to address the historic underinvestment in electrification of railways in Ireland, whereas less than 3% of our railway is electrified compared to an EU27 average of 57%. Powered by a pan-European renewable energy network and realising the ambition of the EU Strategic Agenda to invest in infrastructure for energy, water, transport and communications for a strong and secure, democratic Europe, an expanded electrified rail network provides connectivity, communication and resilience for all member states. Investment Sustained multi-annual funding at an increased level is integral to rail delivering on all desired outcomes with a need to secure the proposed €51.5 billion budget for the Connecting European Facility III Programme 2028 – 2034, as the primary funding programme for rail, in the Multiannual Financial Framework to be finalised and agreed in 2026. Surety of funding will enhance cost efficiencies across the rail projects portfolio in Europe. Concluding Remarks Iarnród Éireann is of the view, that future proofing the railway infrastructure will underpin a secure Europe and a competitive and green Europe. Iarnród Éireann would welcome the opportunity to engage further with the DFA and the DoT to elaborate on this submission."

Electrification Iarnród Éireann’s CONNECT Project, seeks to electrify and modernise Ireland’s rail infrastructure, reduce emissions, and deliver faster, frequent, and sustainable services for passengers and freight. CONNECT is backed by the EU Connecting Europe Facility and the National Development Plan, is a cornerstone of Ireland’s long-term transport strategy and aligns with the All-Island Strategic Rail Review (AISRR). The AISRR highlights that delivering electrification will take time and investment. A rolling programme of electrification will require skills, capacity, robust supply chains, and certainty of long-term investment. Experience from overseas suggests a ‘stop-start’ approach to electrification yields significantly higher unit costs than a rolling programme. Iarnród Éireann has begun advancing several projects recommended within the AISRR, including assessments on four-tracking on the Northern Line, electrification and line speed improvements of the Dublin-Cork corridor and capacity enhancements on the Dublin-Galway line. Iarnród Éireann, the Port Authority for Rosslare Europort, has submitted a planning application for the development of the Rosslare Offshore Renewable Energy Hub, the State’s largest ever purpose-built port facility dedicated to offshore renewable energy (ORE). This investment in clean energy will help to support the future electrification of the rail network. The project has been co-funded to planning stage by the EU Connecting Europe Facility. Train Protection System Iarnród Eireann is investing in its Train Protection System (TPS) to provide a modern, Class A standard system called European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 1. The national roll out of the TPS maintains and improves safety, ensuring that as the railway continues to expand and further major investments are made, safety is at the heart of the network. It also ensures that a robust supply chain for train protection equipment exists as the current systems operating on parts of the network become obsolete and increasingly expensive and difficult to maintain. Transport Orientated Development Iarnród Éireann is working with the Forward Planning system at regional and local authority level to assist planners with aligning housing objectives and transport infrastructure delivery for our growing population. Rail investment plans for the Greater Dublin Area, Cork, Limerick and Galway could unlock land for hundreds of thousands of homes up to 2040, providing affordable, sustainable and reliable transport for new and existing homeowners living close to a railway line. AISRR recommendations The European Investment Bank has also been engaged by the Department of Transport to assist in planning and prioritisation of AISRR recommendations.

Within this content, the Irish Government has the opportunity to prioritise legislative proposals that enhance competitiveness and support world-leading research, development, and innovation. A central element of this agenda will be the EU Biotech Act, a key component of the EU Competitiveness Compass. The European Commission is preparing this initiative as part of the broader European Life Science Strategy. The Biotech Act is expected to shorten approval timelines for clinical trials, facilitate EU-wide multi-country trials through clearer, harmonised procedures, and reduce unnecessary administrative burdens in trial setup and conduct. By removing barriers to clinical trials and promoting integrated, pan-European approaches —especially for rare diseases—this can help make the EU a more attractive environment for R&D investment. Leveraging European Reference Networks (ERNs) and adopting ERN-like models for clinical trial coordination would enhance collaboration, accelerate access to new therapies, and support the EU’s strategic goals in science, medicine, and innovation. Overall, Ireland can help the Biotech Act operate as an instrument that supports competitiveness and simplification, by making clinical development pathways in the EU more predictable and efficient, supporting cross-border research, and encouraging Europe’s competitiveness agenda. The European Health Data Space (EHDS) aims to create a secure, interoperable framework that allows health data to be used and shared across Member States for better patient care, research, innovation, and health policy-making. As such, we recommend Ireland focus on digital health policy, including interoperable datasets, trusted AI deployment, and robust IP and data-governance frameworks. These measures could help support evidence generation, improve care coordination, and support innovation ecosystems across Europe. Beyond specific legislative files, Ireland can also maximise the Council’s efforts by leading key policy initiatives that align with these priorities. This could include convening a multistakeholder forum on Europe’s pharmaceutical and biotech ecosystem to guide a considered, long-term approach to investment, research, development and manufacturing in the EU. Ireland could furthermore sustain an EU level focus on rare diseases by hosting a high-level conference to integrate research and innovation into clinical pathways, disseminate best practice on early diagnosis, digital tools and patient empowerment. Experiences such as the Nordic Rare Disease Summit and Nordic Rare Disease Roadmap provide a template for structured, cross sector collaboration, supported by memoranda of understanding between patient organisations and industry. Takeda has been part of organising and funding the Nordic Rare Disease Summit and is a lead partner. Taken together, this package of legislative and policy work would support the Council, under Ireland’s Presidency."

As the EU continues to address lessons learned from COVID-19, respond to supply chain vulnerabilities, and adapt to the evolving bio-medical landscape, Ireland is well positioned to champion a Presidency agenda centred on the thematic priority of Health Security, with particular emphasis on the security of supply of Substances of Human Origin (SoHO)—including plasma and plasma-derived medicinal products (PDMPs). Ensuring a stable, ethically sourced, and strategically coordinated supply of these essential materials is critical for patient care, health-system resilience, and European strategic autonomy. Within this thematic priority, the strategic focus should be on: Building a Sustainable and Secure SoHO Ecosystem in Europe. Ireland can advocate for coordinated EU-level measures to enhance plasma collection capacity, reduce dependence on third-country imports, and promote innovation in SoHO processing and testing. The recently adopted SoHO Regulation provides a strong foundation, but effective implementation will require ongoing political leadership. Ireland’s Presidency could drive Council work to develop common standards for donor protection, quality and safety, and long-term supply planning. This would strengthen public trust and create a predictable, resilient supply chain for plasma and PDMPs across all Member States. Health Supply Chain Resilience. The EU’s experience during the pandemic revealed structural vulnerabilities across key medical supply chains. By focussing on supply chain resilience for plasma and PDMPs, Ireland can support progress on the EU’s Health Union package, reinforce the mandate of Health Emergency Preparedness and Response, and promote diversification and transparency in global health-related supply networks. Within this context, the high reliance on imported plasma— particularly from the United States—poses a strategic threat. Ireland could lead discussions on developing a coordinated EU plasma strategy, encouraging Member States to publish Plasma Action Plans and expand domestic collection capability, invest in donor recruitment, and support European PDMP manufacturing capacity. Equity, Solidarity and Public Trust in European Health Policy. Ensuring equitable access to PDMPs across Member States, establishing enabling frameworks to support collaborative procurement and EU partnerships to support supply capacity expansion and supply continuity will reinforce the EU’s Mandatory questions commitment to solidarity. Ireland can also highlight the role of community engagement and public awareness in sustaining voluntary, safe and sufficient donation systems. Through focus on health security—and specifically on securing a stable, sustainable supply of plasma and PDMPs for patients across Europe —Ireland can contribute meaningfully to building a more resilient, and strategically autonomous European Union., while delivering tangible benefits for patients and health systems across the EU. This thematic priority also aligns with: The Commission’s planned Global Health Resilience Initiative, which seeks to strengthen global health preparedness; The EU Strategic Agenda 2024 – 2029, priority 1) a strong and secure Europe - through strengthening resilience, preparedness, crisis prevention and response capacities to protect citizens and societies against health emergencies and 2) a prosperous and competitive Europe – through reduced dependencies and diversified and secure strategic supply chains."

Several legislative and policy areas are central to safeguarding Europe’s strategic autonomy in essential medicines. Ireland should therefore prioritise the following areas: Implementation and Consolidation of the Critical Medicines Act (CMA) The CMA provides the framework for strengthening Europe’s resilience against medicine shortages by identifying critical medicines, mapping vulnerabilities, and supporting strategic manufacturing capacity. Under the Irish Presidency, work should focus on: Operationalising the Critical Medicines Alliance to ensure coordinated action on plasma and PDMPs, which are uniquely vulnerable due to the EU’s structural plasma deficit. Driving progress on strategic EU investments in plasma collection capacity—recognised as essential to reducing dependence on third-country imports. Ensuring PDMPs feature clearly within EU critical medicines lists, reflecting their clinical significance and the lack of readily substitutable therapies. Promoting incentives for innovation and capacity expansion, including targeted funding, and streamlined approvals for expanded collection and fractionation infrastructure. By the end of the Presidency, Ireland should aim to have advanced a concrete implementation roadmap for CMA actions related to biological starting materials, including plasma. Effective Roll-Out of the SoHO Regulation (Substances of Human Origin) With the SoHO Regulation entering implementation phase, the Irish Presidency can ensure that its Mandatory questions objectives—safety, quality, availability, and donor protection—are translated consistently across Member States. Article 62 of the SOHO Regulations place a duty on all Member States to make all reasonable efforts to ensure there is a sufficient, stable and resilient supply of critical SOHOs, so that people needing tratements have access when needed. Key priorities include: Harmonised application of donor-protection provisions that facilitates sustainable plasma collection while avoiding barriers that could exacerbate the EU plasma shortfall. Development of guidance on risk-based oversight to support innovation in donor recruitment and new collection models. Strengthening supply-security monitoring mechanisms, ensuring the SoHO Coordination Board captures detailed data on plasma supply, demand, and national collection performance. Ireland should aim for Council conclusions endorsing coherent EU-wide implementation and reaffirming the need to improve self-sufficiency in plasma-derived therapies. 3. Industrial Policy and Strategic Health Security Initiatives Health security is increasingly linked to industrial resilience. The Irish Presidency should focus on: Advancing EU strategic autonomy efforts under the Single Market and Industrial Strategy, ensuring biological starting materials—especially human plasma—are treated as strategic assets. Integrating PDMPs into emergency preparedness frameworks, including stockpiling strategies aligned with HERA and cross-border health-threat coordination. Conclusion The Irish Presidency should use this period to reinforce Europe’s health security by ensuring that the CMA, SoHO Regulation, and wider industrial and pharmaceutical policies deliver a sustainable, resilient plasma and PDMP ecosystem—ultimately supporting EU self-sufficiency and patient access to lifesaving therapies."

PDMPs are used for the treatment of a variety of conditions including immune disorders, neurological disorders, blood disorders and infectious diseases. Anti-D immunoglobulins are PDMPs and are currently the only available treatment for the prevention of RhD immunisation during pregnancy. RhD immunisation happens when a pregnant person with RhD-negative blood type is exposed to RhD-positive blood from their foetus. This can lead to an immune reaction that can seriously impact the health of the foetus, and later of the newborn, and have potentially fatal outcomes. These medicines can only be made from human plasma. As recently as 2011, enough plasma was collected in the EU to meet the needs of EU patients. Since then, however, despite increases in both public and commercial plasma collections, the increasing demand for plasma has exceeded supply. EU countries do Mandatory questions not currently collect enough plasma to meet the needs of EU patients, who have experienced shortages of plasma medicines (plasma-derived medicinal products, or PDMPs). Anti-D immunoglobulins are only produced in a limited number of countries, all located outside the EU creating a significant supply chain vulnerability. Europe’s insufficient collection and its subsequent reliance on plasma imports, primarily from the United States, endangers patient access and thus undermines the health security of EU Member States and Europe as a whole. Experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and times of increased geopolitical tensions show the dangerous consequences of relying heavily on imports of plasma to manufacture these essential plasma medicines. Europe must address this strategic vulnerability to protect its citizens from supply shortages of these critical medicines. Countries with plasmapheresis programmes (public and/or commercial) contribute proportionally more plasma to the manufacturing of PDMPs than countries without such programmes. The new Regulation on Substances of Human Origin (SoHO) urges Member States to increase their collection capacity and donor base for plasma by investing in non-profit and public plasmapheresis programmes. We strongly believe that by increasing their funding towards public collection programmes, EU Member States will greatly improve the prospects of delivering a secure and resilient supply of plasma medicines for their patients in the coming years. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is an active member of the European Blood Alliance who are driving the Commit to Plasma Campaign. This campaign calls on National and EU authorities to increase their political support and funding to public plasma collection programmes with a view to increase the public collection of plasma for fractionation in Europe by 40%, and at a minimum by 25%, by 2030. This would mean increasing the plasma contribution from Europe from 9 million litres in 2022 to at least 11 million litres in the next 5 years. Specifically, the campaign calls on European Commission, the European Parliament, as well as other relevant institutions such as EDQM, to: Work towards equipping Europe with a European Plasma Coordination Plan by 2027, building on the National Plasma plans and to be reviewed regularly. Urge national authorities to commit to increasing public plasma collection, as above, through all means at their disposal, be it through the future European Plasma Coordination Plan or more formal instruments at their disposal such as communications, reports or hearings; Collect and share national data and practices to accompany plasma-collection progress of Member States and Europe as a whole. Reliable, publicly accessible data is missing today; and Engage with other regional and global organisations to exchange data, policies and establish a dialogue to address plasma shortages at a global level. Since 2001, Ireland has imported plasma for therapeutic use to reduce the risk of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease. However, in 2024 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service re-introduced whole blood derived plasma for large scale human therapeutic use. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is now planning to commence plasmapheresis collections to secure increased supply of plasma derived medicinal products Mandatory questions for patients in Ireland."

Many of its thematic priorities must be viewed through the lens of the EU’s security architecture, of which food and agriculture play a critical, yet underappreciated role. Prosperity – for people and planet – will stem from having a cohesive European Union, able to stand on its own two feet internationally. The Biocontrol Coalition therefore suggests that the Irish Presidency prioritise strengthening Europe’s security architecture holistically. Looked through the prism of strengthening the agrifood pillar of EU’s security architecture, the Biocontrol Coalition suggests the following action areas under the overarching theme: Strengthening the functioning of the Single Market to improve predictability, reduce administrative fragmentation and support innovation across the EU’s strategic sectors. Promoting proportionate, future-oriented regulatory approaches that enable safe tools and technologies, including biological ones, to reach users, in particular farmers, in a timely manner, and send a clear signal to European and international innovators that the EU rewards innovation. Enhancing the competitiveness of EU SMEs and innovation ecosystems, particularly in areas that contribute to internal resilience and reduced external dependencies, such as food security, including agricultural inputs. Supporting Europe’s capacity to adapt to climate pressures, by providing the drivers of resilience for essential sectors – such as agriculture – to remain stable and productive. Building consensus around long-term preparedness, ensuring that EU frameworks evolve with scientific progress while maintaining high safety and environmental standards. Placing these priorities at the centre of the Presidency programme would allow Ireland to guide constructive discussions that help Europe remain adaptable, cohesive and prepared for future challenges. Ireland’s tradition of inclusivity and consensus-building positions will play this role while acting as an impartial broker on behalf of all Member States."

Since 2019, there has been a net loss of biological active substances on the EU market. The major drivers of this are long, unsuitable assessment processes and approval times. It takes on average two to three years in key international markets to approve a biocontrol solution, but seven to nine years in the EU. The persistent delays, maladapted aspects of the regulatory framework, and uncertainty undermine the ability of Europe’s farming community to control pests (therefore hampering Europe’s food security), and pushes products researched and developed in Europe to be launched in other markets first (decreasing the Union’s competitiveness). In terms of a holistic concept of security, that erodes Europe’s capacity to meet its own agricultural demands and increases its dependency on trade partners who may or may not remain friendly. Furthermore, climate change, which is increasingly being seen as playing a role in security also influences pest and disease patterns and agricultural resilience. Ireland’s Presidency can help advance work on regulatory modernisation in this key sector, essential for maintaining productivity and supporting farmers, consumers and communities. During its Presidency, Ireland will likely inherit work on the simplification on Food and Feed Safety framework (Regulation 1107/2009). The Biocontrol Coalition welcomes the indicative measures it has seen proposed by the Commission, which will streamline certain procedures, provide some clarity, and help fill current gaps in regulatory expertise. However, while targeted revisions to the existing framework will provide some improvements, they will not address the fundamental issue driving the long approval times: the authorisation process in 1107/2009 is not fit for purpose when it comes to biocontrol products. It will represent a good simplification delivery but not enough to tackle the sector competitiveness gap. The need to put forward a dedicated legislation for biocontrol has been acknowledged by EU Parliament in its recently adopted an own initiative report (INI) on Ensuring Faster Registration and Uptake of Biological Control Agents. Besides other resolutions, this positive political sign from the Parliament has called for the Commission to consider creating a dedicated, fit-for-purpose framework for biocontrol products. It is not the first time that recognition is set it out. In December 2022, the European Commission’s Fit4Future platform has adopted report on Biosolutions and concluded that “there is a need to further develop the legislative framework for biological control products and streamlined provisions.” Dealing with parallels initiatives is not unusual in the EU Commission. The Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 is a good example as there are provisions included in the Chemicals Simplification Omnibus that was published in July, but it is also currently undergoing the Better Regulation process for more fundamental reform with consultation closed in July 2025. With that in mind, we encourage the Presidency to work with the other Member States and EU Institutions to ensure that a proposal for a dedicated, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for biocontrol product is tabled as soon as possible, and ideally in 2027 at the latest to ensure closure of the dossier before the next European elections. Given the worrying net loss of biocontrol active substances, and the increasingly volatile situation exerting pressure on our farmers and EU food security, this should be a top priority for the Presidency."

For farmers and rural economies, predictable access to safe and effective tools — including biological options — helps maintain productivity and stability even during difficult conditions. This supports livelihoods, market confidence and long-term planning. Enhancing the efficiency of the Single Market and improving regulatory clarity also strengthens the position of SMEs and innovators, many of whom contribute significantly to local economies. The Presidency should focus on measures that (i) reduce delays or complexity, (ii) bolster Europe’s readiness to handle future pressures, and (iii) reinforce the EU’s security architecture by ensuring continuity in areas that citizens rely on every day. Ultimately, the Presidency has its role to set an agenda where debates on priorities happen. Besides enabling the progress of the Food & Feed omnibus, it will be of great support to consider including access to innovation and farmers’ toolbox gaps in its Programme by leveraging the topic in Informal meetings and/or events, so the Council can deliver its message towards the EU COM work programme for 2027."

This summary should also be limited to a maximum of 500 words. Biocontrol technologies provide farmers with additional safe and effective tools that complement existing practices. The need to address farmers’ competitiveness is urgent and requires transformational approach that goes beyond simplification measures. A more tailored and proportionate regulatory environment would help ensure that such innovations reach users in a timely manner, supporting productivity, sustainability and competitiveness across the Union. Because these tools are developed largely by European SMEs and rely on internal supply chains, improving their regulatory pathways also strengthens Europe’s internal capabilities. In doing so, it contributes indirectly to the EU’s wider security architecture by supporting continuity in food production and reducing exposure to external disruptions. Ireland’s Presidency can help advance balanced discussions that modernise existing systems while respecting high safety standards and ensuring a level playing field for all technologies."

VEIL is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation, the world’s largest independent refining company and one of the world’s largest producers of renewable fuels, including Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Ireland’s 2026 Presidency of the Council of the European Union presents a strategic opportunity to advance key priorities aligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, particularly in the areas of climate action, energy security and strengthening the EU’s global partnerships. VEIL believes that in order to do so, Ireland should support improving Europe’s access to critical renewable energies, such as HVO and SAF, which are critical to both Ireland’s and the EU’s decarbonization ambitions. Ireland’s Programme for Government and national climate policies place strong emphasis on the role of renewable liquid fuels such as HVO and SAF in reducing emissions from transport, heating, and aviation. These fuels will also be critical to meeting the wider EU’s climate goals helping meet emissions reduction targets under the Green Deal and Fit for 55. However, current EU anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties of approximately €0.34 per litre on U.S.-origin HVO significantly restrict access to the world’s largest HVO market, which now accounts for over 50% of global production. These measures inflate costs for Irish and EU suppliers and consumers, undermine supply security, and conflict with EU climate goals. The limited or indeed absence of any domestic HVO production in many Member States means these tariffs offer little protective benefit to Ireland and to many other Member States. Recent amendments by the European Commission have extended these trade measures to U.S.-origin SAF, despite no investigation or consultation with Member States or industry. Notably, the EU has exempted Chinese SAF from similar treatment, raising concerns about discriminatory policy application and inconsistency with the EU-U.S. energy cooperation agreement of August 2025, under which the EU committed to procure $750 billion in U.S. energy products by 2028. Ireland’s Presidency should therefore prioritize tariff reform on strategic energy products such as HVO and SAF. This aligns with the EU’s broader goals of energy security, climate neutrality and transatlantic trade stability. Ireland can use its Presidency to set the agenda, build coalitions with Member States with little or no domestic HVO production, and engage with the European Commission to encourage a formal proposal for tariff re-evaluation. Coordination with the preceding Presidencies of Denmark and Cyprus will be essential to ensure continuity and momentum. This priority should be advanced through relevant Council configurations, particularly the Energy Council and Trade Council, and supported by informal ministerial meetings and the European Political Community summit. Ireland should promote tariff reform as part of implementing the EU-U.S. strategic energy agreement and advocate for zero tariffs on renewable fuels essential to meeting EU climate targets."

These measures directly impact energy affordability, supply security and climate targets for Ireland and other Member States, and are misaligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and the European Commission’s 2026 work programme. The EU Strategic Agenda calls for a stronger Europe in the world, a green transition and a more resilient economy. However, the continued imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on U.S.-origin HVO and SAF of approximately €0.34 per litre undermines these goals. Ireland’s transport sector alone will require up to 730 million litres of HVO annually by 2030, and with limited domestic production Ireland is mostly reliant on imports. The U.S. is the world’s largest HVO producer, accounting for over 50% of global supply. Current EU trade measures restrict access to this market, inflating costs and threatening supply security. The European Commission’s 2026 work programme is expected to include legislative proposals supporting the Green Deal and Fit for 55 package implementation. Ireland should use its Presidency to ensure that trade policy complements – not contradicts – climate legislation. This includes advocating for the reevaluation or removal of tariffs on U.S. HVO and SAF, particularly in light of the EU-U.S. strategic energy agreement of August 2025, which commits the EU to procure $750 billion in U.S. energy products by 2028. Ireland should also focus on the discriminatory treatment of U.S. SAF compared to Chinese SAF. In February 2025, the Commission exempted Chinese SAF from anti-dumping measures, while extending such measures to U.S. SAF without consultation. This inconsistency undermines the EU’s credibility and risks disrupting aviation fuel supply chains. Relevant Council configurations for advancing these priorities include the Trade Council and Energy Council. Ireland should seek to place tariff reform on the agenda of Council working parties and informal ministerial meetings. It should also coordinate with Denmark and Cyprus, the preceding Presidencies, to build momentum and ensure continuity. In conclusion, Ireland’s Presidency should focus on aligning EU trade policy with its climate and energy goals by prioritizing legislative and policy work that removes barriers to U.S.-origin HVO and SAF. This will support Ireland’s decarbonization strategy, enhance energy security, and reinforce the EU’s commitment to strategic transatlantic cooperation."

Only 17% of SDG targets are currently on track, and more than one-third are stagnating or regressing—trends closely linked to deteriorating outcomes for children, both globally and within the EU. Against this backdrop, Ireland could consider framing its Presidency around three interconnected themes that align with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and support rights-based, sustainable development across the Union. 1. Reducing Child Poverty and Advancing Social Inclusion in Europe Despite Europe’s prosperity, almost one in four children in the EU are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Child poverty is closely linked to poorer health, educational outcomes and long-term economic participation. It is also strongly associated with unhealthy food environments and unequal access to nutritious diets. A Presidency emphasis on child poverty reduction, quality early childhood services, mental health supports and equitable access to education—alongside stronger public-health approaches to child nutrition—would support implementation of the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child and the European Child Guarantee, while strengthening Europe’s human capital and social cohesion. 2. Protecting Children in Situations of Fragility, Crisis and Displacement By 2030, fragile contexts will host 86% of the world’s extreme poor, with children most exposed to conflict, hunger, climate shocks and forced displacement. The EU’s external action is a critical lifeline: ODA focused on children has proven highly effective, with returns such as 54:1 for immunisation and strong evidence that child-focused development investments contribute to stability and economic opportunity. In this context, the Presidency could encourage coherent, rights-based approaches across JHA, FAC and development discussions, including principled humanitarian action, predictable and needs-based ODA, and child-sensitive asylum and migration procedures. Maintaining attention to human development and the SDGs would help safeguard the EU’s credibility as a global leader on human rights and multilateralism. 3. A Child-Centred Green and Digital Transition Children bear disproportionate risks from pollution, climate change and unsafe digital environments. In 2019 alone, air pollution contributed to the deaths of 472 children and young people in the EU, and close to one-third of children cannot assess the trustworthiness of online content. With COP31 taking place during Ireland’s Presidency, there is a unique opportunity to centre intergenerational equity in EU climate diplomacy. The Presidency could promote clean air standards, child-sensitive adaptation and resilience measures, and safe digital ecosystems, while ensuring young people acquire the green and digital skills required for Europe’s future competitiveness. Linking ENVI, TTE, COMPET and EYCS agendas would reinforce the Union’s commitment to a fair and inclusive transition. Across all areas, meaningful, safe and structured participation of children and young people—consistent with the UNCRC—could reinforce democratic legitimacy and public trust in EU institutions."

These areas align with ongoing EU processes, the Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, and global trends affecting children. 1. Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and EU External Action The next MFF (2028–2034) will shape the EU’s capacity to support human development, stability and crisis response. Child-focused investment is consistently among the most effective uses of public funds and is essential to progress on the SDGs, particularly where outcomes for children are stagnating or regressing. The Presidency could support Council discussions that: preserve predictable, poverty-focused ODA and grant-based funding for human development, particularly in fragile contexts; reinforce the EU’s commitment to the SDGs, including health, education and nutrition; and explore child-sensitive tracking approaches, such as a child marker, to improve transparency and accountability of EU spending affecting children. 2. Implementation of the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child Across EPSCO and GAC, the Presidency could help maintain momentum on implementation of the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child and the European Child Guarantee. This could include: reviewing progress on Child Guarantee National Action Plans, including adequacy of resourcing; strengthening monitoring of access to quality early childhood education and care, mental health supports and basic services for vulnerable groups; and promoting the use of comparable data to identify and address disparities. 3. Public-Health Approaches to Child Nutrition Unhealthy food environments are increasingly shaping children’s diets across Europe, contributing to long-term health inequalities. Addressing child nutrition through a public-health and child-rights lens is therefore an important preventive priority. The Presidency could support Council discussions that reinforce evidence-based approaches to nutrition policy, aligned with WHO guidance. A particular priority is the effective regulation of the marketing of breast-milk substitutes, in line with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, to protect breastfeeding and optimal early nutrition. More broadly, action to reduce children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods and to safeguard public-health policymaking from conflicts of interest would support EU objectives on prevention, well-being and equity. 4. Child-Sensitive Responses to Migration, Climate and Crisis Children are disproportionately affected by forced displacement, climate impacts and environmental harms. The Presidency could encourage coherence across JHA, ENVI, TTE and EPSCO discussions to: ensure child-rights safeguards in the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum; integrate child-centred adaptation, clean-air measures and disaster-risk reduction into climate and environmental policies; and strengthen coordination between humanitarian, development and peacebuilding tools to support children in fragile and crisis-affected contexts."

Strengthening Human Capital Through Investment in Children Investing in children is among the highest-return strategies available to governments. For example, every additional year of schooling raises lifetime earnings by about 10 per cent, and early childhood investments deliver significant long-term gains in productivity and wellbeing. Preventive public-health measures—such as protecting breastfeeding and reducing children’s exposure to harmful food marketing—can further reduce long-term healthcare costs, support better educational outcomes, and help address persistent health inequalities across Member States. Prioritising social investment supports the EU’s demographic resilience, labour-market participation, and long-term competitiveness. 2. Embedding Child Rights in EU Policymaking Systematically integrating child-rights assessments into relevant Council configurations - EPSCO, ENVI, COMPET, JHA - could help anticipate unintended impacts and support policymaking that is preventive, not reactive. This contributes to more cost-effective policies in health, social protection, environment and digital safety. 3. Supporting Stability and Security Through Coherent External Action Stable societies depend on educated, healthy and protected children. Investments in children abroad - especially in fragile contexts - serve both EU values and strategic interests. Evidence shows ODA focused on children: Prevents conflict by strengthening social cohesion, Improves stability through inclusive services, Reduces future displacement and irregular migration. By supporting principled, needs-based humanitarian action and predictable development cooperation, the Presidency could help reinforce the EU’s global credibility and security interests. 4. Advancing a Just Green and Digital Transition A child-sensitive approach to the green and digital transitions can deliver immediate community benefits: Reduced air pollution and improved respiratory health, Lower household energy burdens, Safe online environments (especially relevant given that one-third of 10-year-olds cannot assess online trustworthiness), Skills needed for participation in the green and digital labour markets. These measures support the triple transition (green-digital-social) and help ensure no child is left behind. 5. Strengthening Participation and Trust in EU Institutions Meaningful participation increases young people’s sense of agency and belonging. Mechanisms such as youth advisory panels, targeted consultations, and school-based engagement programmes can help ensure EU policies reflect young people’s lived experiences. Involving children in a youth-included rather than youth-led model—recognising they do not need to provide full solutions to contribute meaningfully—supports democratic legitimacy and strengthens trust in public institutions."

Demonstrating how EU legislation contributes to the realisation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child can deepen public understanding of the EU as a guarantor of rights and well-being. 2. Ensure meaningful participation of children and young people Creating structured opportunities for children and young people to contribute to Presidency-related discussions reinforces the EU’s commitment to democratic participation and the rights set out in Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Mechanisms such as youth advisory panels, consultation forums, and school-based engagement activities can ensure processes are youth-included rather than youth-led, recognising that young people do not need to provide definitive solutions in order to share valuable perspectives. Ireland can build on established initiatives such as the Blue Star Programme, while also drawing on complementary rights-based approaches such as UNICEF Ireland’s Child Rights Schools programme to support democratic literacy and participation. 3. Strengthen civic education and media literacy Communications should support children and young people to understand how EU decisions are made and how they can engage with democratic processes. Partnering with education systems, youth organisations and civil society can help counter disinformation, strengthen rights awareness, and promote active citizenship, in line with the EU Strategic Agenda. 4. Highlight intergenerational responsibility in the context of COP31 With COP31 taking place during Ireland’s Presidency, there is a strong opportunity to communicate EU leadership on climate action as an expression of solidarity, sustainability and intergenerational justice. Framing climate action in terms of children’s health, safety and future opportunities can resonate strongly with younger generations and the wider public. 5.

For Communities: Empower local actors as key partners. Youth and community organisations are ready to engage. Through a range of ongoing initiatives, there are young people across the country interested and willing to get stuck in to such work of communicating and sharing the power of European youth work and associated practices. The Presidency should champion funding mechanisms that are accessible to grassroots organisations and promote EU-wide networks for sharing best practices in community development, directly strengthening civil society capacity. For Businesses (especially Social Enterprises): By advancing the Social Economy Framework and supporting the digital and green transition for Social Enterprises, the Council can foster a more resilient, diverse, sustainable and locally rooted business ecosystem.

The Presidency thus offers an opportunity to pursue solutions for our most pressing energy issues. One on hand, Ireland has one of the greatest wind resources in Europe. On the other, our lengthy permitting processes and limited grid availability pose significant barriers to harnessing the full extent of our resources and their associated benefits in reducing both consumer costs and carbon emissions. Ireland is therefore positioned to embark as a pragmatic leader in revolutionizing the energy regulation and legislative landscape, in the aim of rapidly accelerating renewable energy infrastructure delivery to capitalize on our natural resources and deliver affordable, secure and clean energy to people and businesses."

To unlock Ireland’s clean energy potential, BnM proposes the following priority policy areas: Upgrading the European Commission’s European Grids Package: This package will provide Member States with frameworks for permitting and investments. We would strongly urge the Council to pursue a robust developments to the package, including binding permit deadlines, guaranteed anticipatory investment and coordinated regional infrastructure planning. This must be supported by improved access to finance and clear regulatory rules for the transitioning needs of the grid. Accelerating a Revolutionised Permitting Process: Given the magnitude of delays to renewable energy projects due to permitting bottlenecks, we would welcome a concerted effort to establish Ireland as a leader in this field. We propose a specific initiative to meet this objective. We also advise a targeted effort to support the Commission in monitoring RED III compliance regarding administrative delays, alongside developing best practice approaches to permitting with a focus on digital permitting platforms, transparent environmental procedures and showcasing ‘One-Stop Shops’. Accelerating Flexibility and Embedding It Within the System: Another adverse result of Ireland’s grid limitation is the significant amount of energy lost to curtailment and dispatch down, due to the grid’s inability to carry the amount generated. As such, leading by example in accommodating flexible technology to allow the grid to store and flexibly deploy energy should be a paramount priority. BnM would encourage the Council to ensure accommodating market rules for renewable flexibility technologies and services. Recapturing lost energy will significantly reduce consumer cost and ensure optimum efficiency of natural resources."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
97,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/bb973ce3/Individual_submission_-_Submission_97.docx,Burren Lowlands,Individual,Retired concerned citizen,National;,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic,environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to:  Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies.  Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."

Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini &amp; Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied ( Piadeh et. al, 2024 ). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core.The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid 12 development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri- investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry- specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

From an all-island economic perspective, Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise the themes which strengthen the Single Market, support SMEs, and improve the functioning of cross-border trade and innovation networks. This is a unique opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate leadership on the key challenges facing Europe, and to do so in a way that supports the delivery of key policy priorities and economic imperatives on the island of Ireland. Recent initiatives and experiences in areas such as the cost of doing business, regulatory complexity, skills pipelines, and market diversification position Ireland as a voice of authority on these complicated challenges. Proposed overarching theme: ‘A Connected, Competitive, and Collaborative Europe’ Priority Theme 1: A More Competitive and Innovation-Driven Single Market for SMEs The Strategic Agenda commits the Union to bolstering competitiveness, removing barriers in services and essential goods, and accelerating the Capital Markets and Banking Unions. For SMEs on the island of Ireland, especially those operating cross-border, these reforms are essential to scaling, accessing finance, and low-friction trading. Ireland’s Presidency should highlight the contribution of SMEs to Europe’s economic resilience. Priority Theme 2: Strengthening All-Island and Cross-Border Connectivity and Cohesion Cohesion, regional balance, and inclusion are central to the Strategic Agenda. The Commission Work Programme reinforces the need for territorial strategies, water resilience, and strong regional development instruments. Ireland is uniquely placed to demonstrate how cross-border cooperation can drive productivity, innovation diffusion, all-island trade, and inclusive growth, thereby supporting EU objectives for upward convergence and balanced regional development. Priority Theme 3: Delivering a Just and Future-Ready Green and Digital Transition SMEs face specific challenges in adopting digital tools, AI, and green technologies. Ireland should use its Presidency to lead on initiatives such as the European Innovation Act, Cloud and AI Development Act, and Circular Economy Act, which would reinforce a practical, SME-focused approach to Europe’s transitions and harness economies of scale."

Capital access and financial integration Progress on Capital Markets Union and Banking Union would significantly improve SME access to finance and support scaling by firms in small and peripheral markets. Scaling successful start-ups is an important means of driving productivity and competitiveness, and raising capital to scale is a common challenge. Presidency focus on these areas would therefore be strongly welcomed. 3. Cross-border services and mutual recognition of qualifications InterTradeIreland’s research and stakeholder engagement demonstrates that SMEs in tradable services rely on clear and consistent regulatory environments. Presidency emphasis on skills mobility initiatives, professional recognition, and the movement of service providers would have tangible impact across the island and the Union. 4. Circular economy and clean tech adoption Ireland has made remarkable progress in the circular economy. However, complex regulations around end of waste and transfrontier shipments prevent the Union harnessing the benefits of economies of scale in the circular economy and restrict the majority of activity to individual member states. Advancing the Circular Economy Act, clean-tech markets, and simplified permits for infrastructure aligns with the priorities of many all-island sectors, particularly manufacturing, logistics, agri-food, and construction. 5. Better regulation and burden reduction The Commission intends to cut administrative and regulatory burdens significantly in 2026, with major simplification packages across automotive, taxation, environment, and food systems. Drawing on domestic experience, Ireland’s Presidency should emphasise the robust implementation of these packages and an overall approach of SME-friendly regulation."

Accelerate access to skills, innovation and finance InterTradeIreland’s research and engagement clearly demonstrates that skills mobility, innovation funding, digital infrastructure and access to capital remain central barriers for SMEs. Progress in these areas would significantly enhance productivity and competitiveness, supporting the Strategic Agenda’s call to mobilise investment and unlock innovation ecosystems. 3. Strengthen regional convergence and cohesion The island of Ireland is one of the clearest examples of how cross-border regions gain outsized benefits from EU cohesion policy. Focusing on multi-member-state collaboration, water resilience platforms, and cross-border connectivity can ensure communities on the periphery share fully in the Union’s prosperity. 4.

Ireland’s Presidency will allow it to demonstrate leadership on globally significant issues, and particularly the economic system, in a way that is consistent with Irish and European values. It is also an unparalleled opportunity to highlight the unique strengths of the all-island economy, demonstrating how cross-border trade, innovation and SME networks can contribute to wider EU goals. InterTradeIreland particularly supports: A strong focus on implementation, simplification and impact, consistent with the 2026 Work Programme. Progress on Single Market deepening, Capital Markets Union, cross-border services, and digital adoption. Recognition of the role that cross-border collaboration, shared clusters and all-island networks can play in delivering cohesion, competitiveness and a just transition. A Presidency framed around practical benefits for citizens and SMEs, reinforcing Ireland’s reputation as a constructive, facilitative, and solutions-focused Member State. 2. InterTradeIreland’s unique statutory remit is to promote cross-border trade and innovation in support of a competitive all-island economy. Over 25 years, we have supported SMEs in accessing new markets, adopting innovation, and securing investment. More than 61,000 SMEs have benefitted directly from our programmes, and our entrepreneurship and investor-readiness supports have helped early-stage firms secure more than £350 million in investment. We believe Ireland’s Presidency offers a valuable opportunity to highlight how practical cooperation between jurisdictions can deliver real economic impact for businesses and communities, in line with EU priorities on competitiveness, cohesion, and regional convergence. For instance, our Innovation Boost programme is an exemplar of enabling SMEs to access cross-border academic expertise and supports the employment of a dedicated graduate to implement innovation projects that drive competitiveness. InterTradeIreland maintains a comprehensive research portfolio that aligns with EU priorities on evidence-based policymaking. The quarterly All-Island Business Monitor provides one of the most comprehensive real-time indicators of SME sentiment, costs, and operational challenges. Research projects on the circular economy, offshore wind, business supports, and cross-border trade dynamics support wider policy learning. The Trade Hub and Technical Trade Forum help policymakers to understand emerging opportunities and regulatory challenges. Given our statutory mandate, evidence base, and close engagement with SMEs across both jurisdictions, InterTradeIreland would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Irish Presidency by: Showcasing the economic benefits of cross-border cooperation and collaborative innovation for SMEs; Sharing insights from the All-Island Business Monitor, the Trade Hub, and our wider research portfolio; Demonstrating how practical, place-based cooperation supports EU competitiveness, cohesion, and the functioning of the Single Market; Engaging with Council, working groups and Presidency events where SME experience and cross-border evidence can support better EU policymaking. Ireland’s Presidency provides a timely platform to highlight the real-world value of cooperation, evidence and SME-centred policy design; these are principles that InterTradeIreland works to deliver in practice every day. We would particularly welcome the opportunity to formally present our 26 years of experience in areas such as clustering, collaborative information, and enterprise development to a European audience who can benefit from it."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. . A R e s i l i e n t an d P r e p a r e d E u r o p e The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. . A P e o p l e -C e n t r e d U n i o n t h a t P r o t e c t s Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3 .

For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to lifethreatening health incidents."
416,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/458bff38/Individual_submission_-_Submission_416.docx,Food Allergy Centre Padua University Hospital  Padua Italy,,Health sector: Allergy,,2,"Ireland could use its Presidency to champion health resilience, citizen protection, and emergency preparedness, leveraging its national leadership in anaphylaxis response as a model for EU coordination. Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: •Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. •Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: •Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (non legislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness. By focusing on these targeted initiatives, Ireland can use its Presidency to deliver practical, measurable impacts on citizen safety, health equity, and cross-border emergency preparedness while reinforcing the EU’s social and legal frameworks."

For individuals with serious allergies, policies that improve emergency response, access to medicines, and accurate allergen information can be lifesaving. For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives. Replicating Ireland’s best practice on emergency medicine access would ensure that life-saving intervention is available regardless of where a reaction occurs, reducing inequalities across Member States."

The 2026 Presidency can show how EU cooperation protects people, strengthens communities, and makes daily life safer—particularly in areas such as emergency preparedness for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. • Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. • More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizencentred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. • Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. This people-centred framing will strengthen public trust, build ownership, and demonstrate the concrete value of Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

Support EU initiatives on construction sector productivity, skills shortages, and innovation in retrofitting, which directly influence housing supply and affordability. Balanced and effective regional development and enhanced subsidiarity The Irish Delegation to the CoR would like to see the Presidency undertake to focus on balanced regional development across the EU and to share experiences on how enhanced subsidiarity can ensure political accountability. The regional structure of local government in Ireland is weak in comparison to other EU countries and the Irish Delegation to the CoR would welcome a strengthening of the role of regional government in Ireland. The lack of linkage between local authorities and regional assemblies and the Committee of the Regions leads to a deficit in the structures to enable political accountability and legitimacy. Political legitimacy is a key element in a democratic society. There are huge opportunities to examine and review best practice of a cross section of functions from County, city and town councils with administrations across the EU. EU Budget / MFF Central for the Irish Delegation is that the Irish Presidency leads the way on negotiations on the post-2027 Cohesion Policy framework, ensuring an appropriate place based, regionally balanced allocation of funding for Irish and EU regions. The Irish Delegation is calling for balanced and effective regional development and opposes the ‘nationalisation’ of cohesion policy. A clear, distinct and ring-fenced European budget for Cohesion policy as outlined below is required; The definition, at EU level, of indicative regional allocations of resources based on the current consolidated methodology that takes into account social and economic indicators, as well as territorial specificities, thus ensuring a dedicated budget for each category of regions. A safety net allocation, in comparison to the 2021-2027 period, should be granted. A European budget safeguarded to support rural development, which keeps CAP separate from Cohesion policy ensuring that these are not competing with each other. The recognition of the urban aspect and the special role of urban areas. The full respect of the principles of partnership and subsidiarity by granting Europe’s regions a paramount role in the programming and implementation process, through shared management, multilevel governance, ensuring direct negotiation between regions and the European Commission without the need for prior authorisation by the Member State. The Irish Delegation also supports cross-border and transnational cooperation, including the Peace Plus legacy for Border Region of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the continuation of European Territorial Cooperation programmes that Irish local and regional authorities can avail of. Another important priority for the Irish Delegation is to strengthen rural, island, coastal and peripheral regions (important in the context of the Atlantic Strategy) and also to ensure that the LEADER programme is retained, with less of an administrative burden. The Connecting Europe Fund should also be retained to ensure connectivity to rural and peripheral areas. Resilience Resilience is the ability to react to crises, be it climate-related disasters like floods or droughts or security threats. Local and regional authorities are at the forefront when it comes to managing major transitions and crisis impacts. Their role must be strengthened, so that they can adequately address challenges in areas like energy and food security, water management or climate action. A key issue is to improve connectivity, particularly in rural, remote and island regions. Competitiveness On this issue, the Irish Delegation seeks to ensure that the Irish Presidency focuses on the following issues: Accelerating clean energy deployment (offshore wind, grid interconnection, storage). Supporting sustainable agriculture and food security with a pragmatic CAP. Promoting green industrial competitiveness—EU manufacturing of net-zero technologies. Advancing circular economy legislation and nature restoration in a balanced way. Advancing the Single Market 2.0/SME competitiveness agenda as well as supporting strategic autonomy through open trade, especially with stable transatlantic ties. Focusing on digital innovation, AI governance, cybersecurity and trusted data flows. Strengthening Europe’s innovation capacity, university–industry cooperation and startup ecosystems. Securing supply chains for digital infrastructure and semiconductors. The Irish Delegation would like the Presidency to showcase Ireland’s 3 Regional Innovation Valleys (3 Regional Assemblies). RIVs bring together less innovative regions with more innovative ones to address the most burning challenges facing the EU. The competitiveness agenda can only be successful by ensuring appropriate social measures to support social and economic cohesion. These include: Addressing demographic challenges and labour shortages Delivering on the European Pillar of Social Rights, via the European Social Fund Future-proofing the workforce: skills, lifelong learning, digital literacy Strengthening youth mobility and cultural cooperation Other Issues - Relationship with Third Countries THE Irish Delegation would also like to note a number of important topics, in relation to the EU’s relationship with third countries and note that these are important for the Irish Presidency: Strengthening the EU–UK relationship, including implementation of Windsor Framework and Trade & Cooperation Agreement updates. Advancing development partnerships, particularly in climate finance and humanitarian responses, using the CoR’s Cities and Regions for International Partnerships Forum. Enhancing the EU’s role in global conflict prevention and multilateralism. Supporting EU enlargement (Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia). Managing migration through humane, coordinated mechanisms."

By prioritising legislative delivery, improved implementation and consensus-building, the Presidency can help ensure that EU policies translate into tangible benefits across Member States. 1. Leaving no one behind - Putting people and communities at the centre of EU policy A Presidency focused on inclusion can make EU policies more meaningful in daily life. It must delivee on housing. Supporting initiatives on skills, education and labour mobility will help people adapt to economic change and access better job opportunities. Strengthening the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights can improve working conditions, access to social protections and equal opportunities. Progress on humane and coordinated migration and integration policies will help communities manage demographic and labour-market needs while ensuring social cohesion. 2. Delivering a fair and achievable green transition The next phase of climate and energy policy must be designed to support communities as well as meet EU climate goals. By prioritising affordable clean energy, grid interconnection, energy efficiency and renewable deployment, the Presidency can help reduce household costs and strengthen energy security. A balanced approach to sustainable agriculture, food supply chains and rural development will ensure that farmers and peripheral regions benefit from new opportunities. Early progress on cohesion policy for the post-2027 period can improve targeted support for regions in transition and help reduce territorial disparities. 3.Ensuring effective, transparent and citizen-focused governance Finally, the Presidency can promote practical improvements in how EU programmes are delivered. Simpler funding rules, better regulatory coherence and stronger monitoring of results can reduce burdens on administrations and allow businesses and communities to benefit more quickly from EU initiatives. Clear communication of EU actions during the Presidency can also help citizens better understand and engage with the Union. By advancing these priorities in an open, constructive and pragmatic manner, the Irish Presidency can help deliver real improvements in prosperity, security and opportunity across Europe. Advancing a more competitive and innovative Europe The Presidency can drive measures that directly support SMEs, entrepreneurs and workers. Progress on the renewal of the Single Market—particularly in services, digitalisation and reducing administrative burdens—would lower costs for businesses and expand opportunities for cross-border activity. Advancing responsible AI governance and improved cybersecurity will give citizens confidence and create a stable environment for innovation. Work on research cooperation, skills and a supportive investment framework will help businesses scale and ensure Europe remains at the forefront of technological development. Strengthening security, stability and resilience Citizens need to feel protected in a rapidly changing world. By improving coordination on cybersecurity, tackling hybrid threats and strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructure, the Presidency can contribute to safer digital and physical environments. Supporting a credible EU enlargement policy—based on democratic standards and institutional readiness—can enhance stability in the EU’s neighbourhood. Constructive engagement in the evolving EU–UK relationship will also help secure smoother cooperation for border regions and businesses."

The goal is not only to inform citizens but to involve them in the story of Ireland’s role in Europe. The Irish Delegation to the CoR, are locally elected ‘ambassadors for the EU’ in every town, city and rural area of the country and stand ready to assist in communicating the positive messages about the work of the EU and its impact on citizens. A number of ideas on how to do this effectively are listed below: 1. Make EU benefits tangible and local and use plan accessible language Citizens engage most when EU membership is linked to everyday life, so the Irish Delegation would like to see the following actions as part of Ireland’s Presidency. Highlight more of the specific, place-based examples of EU-funded projects—transport links, research centres, broadband roll-out, environmental restoration, youth programmes. The 3 Regional Assemblies, as Managing Authorities for EU programmes have many examples of projects that can be used. Use data, case studies and storytelling to show how EU policies lower costs, create jobs, support farmers, expand consumer rights and strengthen security. • Map Ireland’s Presidency priorities to issues the public cares about: affordability, housing, climate resilience, digital safety, opportunities for young people. Technical EU language can distance the public. Communication should be clear, direct and free of acronyms and focused on “what this means for you”. Information can be delivered through short formats—videos, infographics, social content—rather than lengthy institutional text. Framing should connect EU values to Irish values: fairness, solidarity, opportunity, openness and respect for community. The Irish Delegation suggests that the Presidency should support training for elected members to clearly communicate the benefits of the EU to citizens. Put citizens and communities at the heart of the Presidency narrative Citizens should feel that the Presidency is not an elite or institutional event, but a moment of national participation and the Irish Delegation believes this can be done effectively by creating a unifying Presidency slogan that speaks to shared European and Irish values. Also, it is important to promote stories of Irish people who shape Europe—researchers, small businesses, students, cultural figures. The Irish Delegation calls for measures and funding to encourage local authorities, schools, universities and community groups to hold Presidency-linked events, debates and cultural activities across all regions. This could be similar to DFAT’s Communicating Europe programme. In addition, the EU Network of Local Councillors has over 100 Irish Members, based across the country who can assist with promotion of messaging to citizens. Similarly, the CoR’s Young Elected Politicians can support this work. Activate young people and strong messaging Young people are among the most positively disposed toward the EU but often feel least engaged in EU processes. It is important to expand youth dialogues, panels and competitions connected to Presidency themes. There may be scope to use schools and universities as multipliers by providing toolkits, learning modules and engagement grants. Perhaps the use of young digital creators for digital media campaigns would help with messaging. The Irish Delegation would welcome two-way engagement over the course of the Presidency and stand ready, in conjunction with the CoR to organise regional citizen dialogues and online consultations on topics relevant to the Presidency. In addition, organisations such as the NYCI, Foróige, Comhairle na nÓg and the National and European Youth Forum could be involved. It is important that this feedback is used to shape messages or highlight public concerns in Council discussions. The CoR can be used as an important EU institution to get messages across to the public and the Irish Delegation will support the Irish Presidency in this regard. The Irish Presidency can use open days, livestreamed events, interactive exhibitions and behind-thescenes videos to demystify EU decision-making and should highlight Ireland’s role as a consensus-builder, emphasising how the Presidency serves all Europeans—not just institutions."

This summary should also be limited to a maximum of 500 words. EU Local Government Support Service The Irish Delegation calls for the Government to take a decision on the proposal which has been submitted to DHLGH on an EU Local Government Support Service. The strategy also seeks to build a network of EU funding officers across local government in Ireland and it would provide local authorities with a one stop shop approach to navigating the EU policy and funding arena, ensuring complementarity, to best suit the needs of each local authority, in line with their corporate and strategic plans and the availability of the range of funding programmes (ERDF / ESF/ ETC / Other Competitive Funding Programmes). The Irish Delegation to the CoR believe that this proposal is timely in light of Ireland’s Presidency of the EU and sends a positive message to Europe that Irish local government is fully engaged in the EU. It is also an opportune time to raise the awareness and engagement regionally and locally in EU policy matters and participation in EU funding programmes. CoR Presidency Events The Irish Delegation to the CoR, together with the IREO, the Perm Rep and Govt Departments will be involved in the organisation of several high level meetings for the Presidency including: Welcome reception – ‘Projects and Produce’ from Ireland’s Regions – 1st July, CoR building, Brussels External ECON Commission, Galway (date tbc) External Bureau, (location and date tbc) The Irish Delegation to the CoR would welcome engagement and the opportunity to propose suitable locations for the External Bureau meeting and encourage DFA to engage fully with Members on the detail of this meeting. The Irish Delegation to the CoR are calling for extra and increased support to the Irish Regions European Office to ensure the effective delivery of the above work – ensuring that the Irish local and regional government can deliver for Ireland during these important months for the country and for Europe. The Irish Delegation would welcome ongoing and detailed engagement with DFAT during the upcoming stakeholder discussions on issues for Presidency referrals to the CoR."
329,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c2ee52d5/Irish_Council_for_Civil_Liberties_-_Submission_329.docx,Irish Council for Civil Liberties,,,,1,"Our Europe: free, resilient, democratic Caught between a military threat from Russia and a United States project to undermine liberal democracy, the EU is facing an uncomfortable reality. As a small, open economy with a strong human rights record, history of colonialism, deep commitment to peace and credible international voice, Ireland can guide the EU during these turbulent times by engaging in principled international diplomacy that signals protection of the values- and rules-based European order that the block was founded on (in line with Art 2 of the Treaty on European Union). This will project a resilient Europe willing to act to protect democratic values, freedoms, laws and institutions against current threats, an approach that is anchored in the rule of law and respect for human rights, as the block’s primary strength and selling point within Europe and globally. The democratic decline in Europe is stark. Eastern Europe is experiencing a “particularly steep decline” and Western Europe a surge in popularity of far-right parties. This has led to significant pressures on the rule of law, and attacks against civic space and civil society, including in countries (e.g. such as France and Germany) that were, until recently, considered bastions of liberal democracy. The decline is expected to continue during and beyond the Irish Presidency and current negative trends risk becoming normalised, presenting unprecedented opportunities for authoritarians. Washington’s overwhelming control of Europe’s technology and media is an important element of the current threat to democracy. While this issue is particularly sensitive for Ireland because of its reliance on foreign direct investment and presence of Big Tech and social media platforms in Ireland, the interest in preserving European democracy during the Presidency must be overriding, as part of its “honest broker role”. Furthermore, it must be recognised that the EU has incurred significant reputational damage associated with the genocide in Gaza (due to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s position and inaction as a bloc leading to accusations of complicity coupled with active facilitation of the violence by individual Member States). Ireland can provide direction on the strategic need for a values-based, forward-looking, inclusive, people-centred Europe and European foreign policy, to restore confidence in European institutions and values on the international stage. This will require ambition and going against the tide on occasion but Ireland is in a unique position to provide vision and leadership."
329,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c2ee52d5/Irish_Council_for_Civil_Liberties_-_Submission_329.docx,Irish Council for Civil Liberties,,,,2,"Protecting civil society and civic space Ireland should focus on ensuring the EU’s Civil Society Strategy is well-funded and implemented during its Presidency as part of defending European democracy. During negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework Ireland should ensure maximum funding is negotiated for the AgoraEU programme, specifically €3.6 billion for CERV+ as a baseline investment in civil society as the backbone of European democracy. The bulk of the negotiations will take place during Ireland’s Presidency and there is a unique opportunity for Ireland to defend the budget, including against attempts from other Member States to undermine it. More broadly, Ireland should push for support at a European level to facilitate greater philanthropic engagement with civil society and connect pro bono legal resources with civil society organisations to facilitate their work, as per commitments in the Civil Society Strategy. Promoting and safeguarding multilateralism and the rule of law International justice, international humanitarian law, the human rights system (including the Special Procedures) and multilateralism have come under unprecedented attack as part of recent geo-political shifts. To counter this Ireland should leverage its position during the Presidency to reaffirm and champion multilateral institutions that defend rules-based order and provide leadership on how to enforce international law. This will necessitate an ambitious, principled and forward-looking approach. In partnership with like-minded states, Ireland can provide leadership in key areas by e.g: working to protect the International Criminal Court and those that engage and co-operate with it as a means of fighting impunity for international crimes; going beyond recognition of Palestine to take concrete steps to ensure its territorial integrity and legal personality (as a follow-on to Ireland’s recognition of Palestine on 28 May 2024 and formal endorsement of the Two-State Solution); protecting and strengthening Palestinian civil society and journalists working for the protection and upholding of human rights; - pushing for robust EU-level action to end the genocide, if ongoing, and implement a recovery plan for Gaza. 3. Protecting children’s online safety Ireland’s Presidency should highlight children’s vulnerability in the digital age and prioritise the protection of children from harmful content (e.g. self-harm, self-loathing and suicide) being pushed into their online feeds by digital platforms’ recommender algorithms. As the regulatory epicentre of the digital world, Ireland is in a unique position to do this. It has responsibility for all of Europe for supervising how children’s data are used by YouTube, TikTok, SnapChat, etc. and ensuring that they are protected. During the Presidency, Ireland should lead the Council in preparing a Manifesto Against Child Harm Online that defines what enforcement to protect children should look like across the Union. Continued below in the “Any other comments” section. The above will deliver concretely on objectives listed in the Strategic Agenda’s focus on “a free and democratic Europe” (e.g., strengthening democratic resilience; protecting free and pluralistic civil society; safeguarding the rule of law)."
329,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c2ee52d5/Irish_Council_for_Civil_Liberties_-_Submission_329.docx,Irish Council for Civil Liberties,,,,3,"Ensure that the Civil Society Strategy’s emphasis on strengthening “effective and meaningful engagement with civil society as a partner” in law/policymaking is implemented in a concrete and meaningful way. This includes allowing the necessary time for consultation, debate on, and oversight of the lawmaking process. Ireland has an opportunity to proactively defend civil society’s participation in such democratic processes, while working to protect civic space and ensuring CSOs are empowered to contribute safely. Ensure that law/policymaking during the Presidency does not undermine fundamental rights, in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. This includes any encroachment by state and corporate actors and necessitates ensuring that law-making is evidence-based, transparent, inclusive and includes comprehensive rights impact assessments, as relevant and where fundamental rights may be under threat. It is particularly important that the voices of marginalised and minority groups are sought out and listened to as part of a Europe where everyone’s human rights are respected. The EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has documented how fundamental rights impact assessments are not carried out for all legislative files where they are needed and how these assessments are “often superficial”. The EU deregulation agenda for digital rights has also been accused of undermining democratic processes (in addition to digital rights) in recent weeks. It is essential that Ireland uses the Presidency to push back against such trends."

By proactively communicating in an accessible way about what Ireland is seeking to achieve on the EU stage during the Presidency: Having a coordinated, strategic communications plan for the Presidency which operates across all media and speaks directly to the public of Ireland. Using accessible, plain language to clearly communicate about the Presidency. Using all communications channels and touchpoints available to the Presidency to ensure your message reaches people of all ages in all parts of Ireland, e.g., print and broadcast media, social media, public buildings, invitations, events, partnerships. Ensuring that newer media forms, e.g., social media channels, podcasts, etc. are firmly integrated in all communication plans. Proactively working with content creators and influencers to open up the Presidency, and related events and discussions, to a wider audience. By moving beyond rhetoric to deliver concrete outputs i.e. by showing what being a member of the EU delivers for people. By showing leadership on issues that Irish people care about, including complex issues where there is a lack of consensus e.g., using the full force of its diplomatic powers, with like-minded states, to achieve progress on Palestinian rights; by calling out and providing values-based leadership on protecting rights (e.g., of minorities, civil society) that are under attack. By facilitating the involvement of different stakeholders in Presidency activities e.g. events, launches, town halls, awareness-raising, including at community-level and across the country. By engaging people through awards and prize-giving, thereby celebrating Ireland’s contribution to the Presidency and Europe’s place in the world. By engaging in targeted outreach on the Presidency in creative ways to youth, marginalised and minority communities in Ireland."

From a World Vision perspective, Ireland should champion a Presidency agenda rooted in people-centred values, global solidarity, and climate justice, aligning with the EU Strategic Agenda and Ireland’s own tradition of principled diplomacy. We would suggest a number of themes that Ireland should prioritise during its Presidency. Firstly, climate justice and resilience must be a flagship priority. As climate impacts intensify, Ireland can lead efforts to operationalize the Global Goal on Adaptation agreed at COP30, ensuring that EU climate action integrates adaptation financing, nature-based solutions, and intergenerational equity. This is not only about reducing emissions but about safeguarding lives and livelihoods in fragile contexts, where children are disproportionately affected by climate shocks. Ireland should elevate child rights and social inclusion as a core theme, reinforcing the EU’s commitment to human dignity and equality. With millions of children facing violence, exploitation, and disrupted education due to conflict and displacement, Ireland can advocate for stronger EU external action on addressing child poverty globally. Investing in children is one of the most powerful and cost-effective strategies for building resilient societies and sustainable economies. From World Vision’s standpoint, this means prioritizing policies and resources that ensure every child has access to health, nutrition, education, protection, and participation. Evidence shows that interventions in early childhood, such as adequate nutrition, quality education, and safe environments yield lifelong benefits, breaking cycles of poverty and inequality. Sustainable food systems and nutrition deserve high-level attention, given the intersection of climate change, biodiversity loss, and global hunger. Sustainable food systems and nutrition must remain a central EU priority which are fundamental to achieving health, equity, and climate resilience. The EU’s leadership in this area is critical for addressing the triple burden of malnutrition/undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity while transforming food systems to be fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable. Ireland can lead on advancing the EU Green Deal globally, promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture and climate-smart food systems to end child malnutrition. Fragile and conflict-affected contexts with a coherent approach across CODEV and COHAFA, ensuring a full humanitarian-development-peace nexus and advocating for their inclusion in MFF, Global Europe, and Global Gateway negotiations with appropriate funding levels and flexible modalities. In parallel, given escalating violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the EU’s ambition to strengthen humanitarian diplomacy, Ireland should make IHL a headline commitment, advance reflections on the Humanitarian Reset, and align with the upcoming EC Humanitarian Communication to reinforce EU leadership in protecting civilians and upholding humanitarian principles. These priorities reflect Ireland’s values and the EU’s strategic objectives while responding to urgent global challenges. By framing its Presidency around “A People-Centred Europe: Leading on Climate Justice, Child Rights, and Global Solidarity,” Ireland can position itself as a champion of fairness and sustainability, reinforcing Europe’s role as a trusted global partner. This is an opportunity to advocate for policies that protect children, empower communities, and deliver climate-resilient futures, ensuring that the EU’s influence translates into tangible improvements for those most at risk."

Ireland’s EU Council Presidency in 2026 should play a pivotal role in shaping the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028–2034). Ireland should act as an honest broker to secure a balanced budget that reflects solidarity, sustainability, and global responsibility. This means protecting strong allocations for humanitarian aid, development cooperation, and resilience-building under Heading 6 (Neighbourhood & the World), while ensuring climate adaptation and biodiversity funding remain central to national and regional plans. Ireland should prioritize predictable financing for child-focused programmes, education, and social protection, and push for policy coherence linking food systems, nutrition, and climate resilience. By embedding child rights and climate justice into the MFF negotiations, Ireland can ensure EU resources deliver tangible benefits for vulnerable communities globally, positioning Europe as a leader in fairness and sustainability. In addition, Ireland must maintain CSO space within the context of the MFF this means transparency (of information, on programming, around consultations etc.), adequate aid modality in which CSOs are included etc. Ireland should ensure meaningful space (and funding modality) for civil society in the Global Europe Regulation. In line with the Presidency’s stated prioritisation of civil society, it would be valuable to continue regular exchanges with Brussels-based humanitarian INGOs, particularly around the margins of the monthly COHAFA meetings. These meetings have proven useful during the Danish presidency for ensuring information-sharing and exchanges on topical issues. Denmark has encouraged the next EU Presidencies to continue this format. The Presidency should prioritize policy areas that protect vulnerable populations, address climate impacts, and strengthen global partnerships. Climate and environmental legislation must be at the forefront. Ireland should lead negotiations on the implementation of the Nature Restoration Law and the post-2030 climate framework, ensuring that adaptation financing and just transition principles are embedded in EU law. This includes operationalizing commitments under the Global Goal on Adaptation agreed at COP30, with a strong emphasis on nature-based solutions and resilience for communities most affected by climate shocks. Ireland should also champion child rights and social inclusion within the EU’s equality agenda. Legislative proposals linked to the European Child Guarantee and the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child offer a platform to strengthen child protection systems, inclusive education, and gender equality. The Presidency should aim to secure Council conclusions that integrate these priorities into both internal and external EU policies, ensuring that development cooperation reflects a child-centred approach. On sustainable food systems and nutrition should be a key legislative focus, building on the Farm to Fork Strategy and CAP reform. Ireland can drive progress on proposals that promote climate-smart agriculture and nutrition-sensitive approaches, addressing global hunger and child malnutrition. The EU has made ambitious commitments at the Nutrition4Growth Summit; EC services are presently reflecting on how the targets will be quantified and programmed, of course in alignment with the Global Gateway approach. The EU needs to ensure meaningful programming of its nutrition commitments, with clear targets and measurement. Ireland can play a central role in delivering on these."

Ireland should ensure that the Global Dimension of the EU Child Rights Strategy is implemented in a meaningfully manner. The Presidency should go beyond symbolic engagement and create structured, impactful opportunities for youth voices to influence policy. Ireland can convene a Youth Forum linked to the Presidency agenda, ensuring representation from diverse backgrounds, including marginalized and vulnerable groups. This forum could feed directly into informal ministerial meetings and Council conclusions, giving youth perspectives real weight in shaping priorities such as climate action, digital transformation, and social inclusion. In addition, the Presidency should integrate child and youth consultations into legislative discussions on files like the European Child Guarantee, education, and digital rights, using accessible formats and child-friendly language. Ireland can champion participatory mechanisms at EU level, advocating for the institutionalization of youth engagement in Council processes—building on the EU Youth Strategy and aligning with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Communication efforts should highlight stories of youth leadership, framing the Presidency as a moment where young people help shape Europe’s future. Finally, Ireland should ensure that participation is safe, inclusive, and meaningful, providing feedback loops so children and youth see how their input influences outcomes. By embedding these practices, Ireland can set a precedent for a Presidency that not only listens to young voices but acts on their ideas—strengthening democracy, fostering trust, and advancing policies that reflect the needs and aspirations of the next generation."

This means ensuring that communication reflects the human dimension of EU membership: protecting children, empowering communities, and building a sustainable future for all. The narrative should emphasize shared values of solidarity, justice, and sustainability, connecting EU policies to everyday lives. By focusing on human stories showing how EU initiatives improve education, protect children’s rights, and support families during crises. Demonstrating that EU membership enables Ireland to influence global decisions on climate action, humanitarian aid, and social protection reinforces the idea that Ireland’s voice matters in shaping a fairer world.

425,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2acfca67/Nofence_-_Submission_425.docx,Nofence,,,,1,"Ireland’s Presidency offers an opportunity to champion a vision of Europe in which rural competitiveness, environmental ambition and technological innovation reinforce one another. A priority should therefore be the construction of a future-oriented, digitally enabled agricultural model that is both economically viable and environmentally resilient. A second priority should be the development of an environmentally-responsive approach to land use that recognises targeted grazing as a nature-based solution. Irish experience demonstrates how precise control of livestock movement can restore under-grazed habitat, reduce fire risk, protect vulnerable plant species and improve soil structure. As we know, 2025 has been the worst year on record for wildfires across Europe. Faced with ever-rising temperatures, the frequency of such natural hazards will continue to rise. Ireland can frame precision grazing not simply as a sector to be promoted, but as an ecological tool that, when guided by modern technology, can accelerate wildlife protection, biodiversity recovery and climate adaptation. Moreover, the EU must address the acute challenge of generational renewal in agriculture and in particular, livestock grazing. It is increasingly clear that labour demands, physical strain and inflexible management systems deter younger farmers from entering or remaining in livestock farming. Virtual fencing is an example of a technology that is already allowing farmers across Ireland and other EU countries to reduce daily physical workload, manage farming operations more productively, respond faster to issues through real-time alerts and, crucially, achieve a better balance between work and family life. A Presidency that champions more accessible and attractive farming careers would be directly responding to an EU-wide concern."
425,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2acfca67/Nofence_-_Submission_425.docx,Nofence,,,,2,"The Irish Presidency will coincide with several major legislative moments that will shape European agriculture for a decade or more. Ireland should use its role to ensure that the Union’s evolving frameworks fully embrace practical innovation, farmer wellbeing and environmentally responsible grazing. The 2028–2034 CAP proposal already identifies digitalisation, competitiveness, and generational renewal as core objectives. A robust, dedicated CAP budget is therefore the essential starting point. Irish experience shows that when CAP funding is clearly ringfenced in the EU’s financial framework and supported across both Pillar I and Pillar II, it underpins farm incomes, rural employment and investment in innovation and environmental schemes. If that budget is eroded or diluted into more general funds, farmers lose a crucial safety net and the capacity to invest in the transition that policymakers are asking of them. Within that budgetary framework, Ireland should work to ensure that the CAP and the Generational Renewal Strategy reinforce each other. The Commission rightly stresses that younger farmers need lower entry barriers, reduced labour demands and access to modern tools. Ireland should advocate that the CAP’s legal text and implementing guidance explicitly recognise digital tools that enable farmers to enhance sectoral resilience, support environmental ambitions and reduce the stress associated with livestock management as eligible investments under modernisation, digitalisation and agri-environmental measures. Building on this, Ireland is well positioned to shape EU-level discussions on Member State implementation of domestic generational renewal strategies by 2028. It is imperative that the urgency of generational renewal is recognised and openly acknowledged through steering EU discussions toward practical means of addressing barriers to a competitive and resilient EU agriculture sector. By promoting access to enabling technologies such as virtual fencing, encouraging CAP instruments that reduce day-to-day workload and capital costs, and supporting Member States in integrating these tools into their domestic generational renewal strategies by 2028, Ireland can drive EU-wide sectoral change to the benefit of all farmers. Moreover, shaping the forthcoming EU Livestock Strategy will be important in ensuring that the strategy reflects the need to overcome the declining demographic in livestock grazing across Europe. Digital grazing control has enabled farmers to safely graze previously inaccessible lands, restore uplands, reduce wildfire risk and protect vulnerable habitats. The strategy should emphasise not only technology’s role in addressing low demographic turnover in livestock farming by reducing physical strain, but also recognise precision grazing as a core method for delivering biodiversity and climate-adaptation objectives."
425,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2acfca67/Nofence_-_Submission_425.docx,Nofence,,,,3,"The Irish Presidency should promote policies that unlock the productive potential of land that is currently under-utilised or economically marginal. In Ireland, virtual fencing has allowed farmers to reintroduce grazing to steep slopes, commonage land and areas where physical fences are impractical or contentious. This has led to ecological gains through breaking up overgrazing of pastures, thus restoring heather soil as well as improved economic efficiency. If Ireland uses its position to emphasise precision grazing as a valuable tool for land management, it can help Member States meet biodiversity and climate obligations in ways that reduce, rather than increase, burdens on rural enterprises. Digitalisation more broadly is another area where the Council’s work can have a transformative effect. When rural digital infrastructure is strengthened, the benefits extend well beyond agriculture. Local businesses gain new opportunities, schools and healthcare facilities benefit from improved service delivery, and remote regions become more attractive for residence and investment. By advocating that EU connectivity programmes prioritise rural regions, Ireland can ensure that the long-term social and economic dividends of digitalisation are felt by the communities that need them most. Ultimately, the Council’s work during Ireland’s Presidency can have the greatest impact by elevating solutions that combine economic pragmatism with environmental responsibility. Technologies such as virtual fencing embody this balance, enhancing welfare and sustainability while reducing costs and labour demands. Ireland can help show that Europe’s climate ambitions are achievable when policies support the practical tools that make sustainable farming both feasible and rewarding."
425,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2acfca67/Nofence_-_Submission_425.docx,Nofence,,,,5,"Virtual fencing has allowed more than 1,200 Irish animals to graze safely on difficult terrain, enabled farmers to reduce labour and infrastructure costs, and supported ecological restoration in areas previously considered too sensitive or inaccessible for livestock. A critical step for the EU will be ensuring that digital livestock technologies are treated as distinct and complementary tools within agricultural funding frameworks. As seen in Ireland, scheme design matters. Where investment catalogues favour traditional infrastructure such as permanent fencing, farmers have limited ability to adopt virtual fencing even when it delivers higher welfare standards, and improved environmental and economic outcomes. It is important to recognise that digital boundaries achieve fundamentally different results. Ireland can help make this distinction clear at EU level by raising awareness among policymakers of the tangible benefits these tools bring to rural communities and by encouraging funding approaches that support innovation rather than unintentionally constraining it."

Adult learning is the foundation of inclusion, democratic resilience, and sustainability, all of which underpin Europe’s competitiveness. It is a strategic lever to advance key policy objectives across many domains. The recognition of the value of adult learning in the objectives for the Presidency is not just an economic necessity but a social and democratic imperative. The integral importance of adult learning to the themes proposed by the Community and Voluntary Pillar are outlined below: Theme 1: Strengthening the Vision of a Social Europe Adult learning is a social right under Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Principle 1 of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Ensuring access to lifelong learning is essential for tackling poverty and social exclusion. Upskilling and reskilling for disadvantaged groups including migrants, older adults, and low-income workers, supports income adequacy and employability, reducing reliance on minimum income supports. Education as social infrastructure: Investment in adult learning, alongside housing, childcare and health, creates inclusive pathways for participation in economic, social, and cultural life. Theme 2: Enhancing Civil Society Participation and Deepening Democracy Adult learning fosters democratic resilience: Citizenship education and critical thinking skills help counter disinformation and strengthen civic engagement, aligning with initiatives like the Democracy Shield and the EU Civil Society Strategy. Inclusive governance requires inclusive learning: Adult learning empowers marginalised communities to engage in policy dialogue, ensuring their voices shape EU decisions. Community-based learning models and participatory structures (e.g., the AONTAS National FET Learner Forum) exemplify participatory education that builds trust and social cohesion. Global Citizenship Education: In today's globalised and interdependent, interconnected world, citizenship has a global dimension. A focus on Global Citizenship Education can ensure that people are informed, aware and empowered to take action on pressing social issues to support more just, peaceful, secure, sustainable, tolerant and inclusive societies. Theme 3: Renewed Emphasis on a Just Transition Skills for sustainability: Adult learning equips workers and communities for green and digital transitions, reducing vulnerability during economic restructuring. Lifelong learning as a climate and social justice tool: Education enables informed participation in sustainability initiatives and supports equitable access to new opportunities in the green economy. SDG alignment: Promoting lifelong learning (SDG 4) underpins progress on other SDGs, reinforcing Ireland’s proposed Presidency theme of “Delivering the SDGs: A Sustainable Europe for Future Generations.” In today's globalised and interdependent, interconnected world, citizenship has a global dimension.

AONTAS are the National Coordinators for NEAAL and are positioned to help drive action on this policy area. Policy and legislative proposals linked to the European Skills Agenda (2020), including Upskilling Pathways, Individual Learning Accounts, and Micro-credentials, should be actively progressed. Driving progress on these key policy and legislative areas aligns with Ireland's track record of leadership in the field of education, and a global vision of learning as a tool for social transformation rather than solely economic competitiveness. Aim: Strengthen and position adult learning as a driver of social cohesion and democratic participation. Ireland should advocate for increased investment in lifelong learning and ensure that marginalised groups, migrants, older adults, and low-skilled workers, are prioritised in EU funding and policy frameworks. 2. Democratic Citizenship and Civic Education EU Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law, and Consumer Protection, Michael McGrath, has played a pivotal role in advancing initiatives like the Democracy Shield. The rise of populism and democratic backsliding across Europe highlights the urgent need for education that nurtures democratic values. Ireland should position its EU Presidency to champion the Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education (Council of Europe, 2010) as a guiding framework for adult learning on this theme. While not legally binding, its principles offer a powerful foundation for shaping Council conclusions or resolutions during Ireland’s term. Aim: Secure Council endorsement for integrating democratic and civic education into adult learning strategies. This could include a declaration linking lifelong learning to the European Democracy Shield initiative, reinforcing education’s role in combating disinformation and promoting active citizenship. 3. Social Inclusion and Cohesion Ireland’s Presidency should frame adult learning within the broader EU agenda on social fairness and resilience. Legislative proposals under the European Pillar of Social Rights, particularly Principle 1 on lifelong learning, should be highlighted. Ireland can leverage its unique position as a high-growth economy to advocate for inclusive education policies that address structural barriers faced by disadvantaged groups. Aim: Push for measurable targets on participation by marginalised populations in EU Council conclusions, ensuring that the 60% adult learning participation goal by 2030 is met equitably across member states. 4. Skills for Green and Digital Transitions Action 6 of the European Skills Agenda and the Digital Action Plan provide a key basis for action in the forthcoming Presidency. The Union of Skills initiative and the Action Plan on Basic Skills provide legislative pathways for Ireland to advance a skills agenda that balances competitiveness with inclusion. Ireland should ensure that these proposals incorporate non-formal and community education models, reflecting a vision of education for social transformation. Aim: Advocate for flexible, learner-centred approaches, and recognition of non-formal learning, within EU policy frameworks."

The main objective of the next programme cycle in 2026, Futures in Focus: Strengthening Adult Learning for a Changing World is to place adult learning at the centre of a future European Society that is inclusive, just, and democratic. This can only be achieved by cross-sectoral collaboration between policy and practice. AONTAS’ role as National Coordinator of the NEAAL programme positions us a key resource to promote this programme during the EU presidency. Across Europe, Ireland is seen as a leader in education- the Presidency offers us the opportunity to focus attention on the power of adult learning to create positive social change and tackle our most pressing challenges. By focusing on adult learning, democratic citizenship, social inclusion, and skills for future transitions, Ireland can use its Presidency to position education as a cornerstone of a democratic, cohesive, and competitive Europe. Currently, participation in lifelong learning across Europe falls significantly short of the 60% target, and remains deeply stratified along socio-economic lines (OECD, 2025). This gap threatens not only individual opportunity but also the collective resilience and competitiveness of the European Union. We strongly urge the Department of Foreign Affairs to actively engage with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to champion Ireland’s leadership in upholding the core values of the European Union while promoting adult learning. Strategic collaboration with the adult education sector is essential to: Promote best practice across Europe Drive innovation in lifelong learning Respond effectively to shared policy priorities Integrating the recommendations in this document directly contributes to the EU’s strategic pillars: A free and democratic Europe strengthening democratic resilience and debate protecting free and pluralistic media and civil society upholding the UN Charter and promoting global peace, justice and stability A strong and secure Europe strengthening resilience, preparedness, crisis prevention and response capacities to protect citizens and societies against different crises, such as natural disasters and health emergencies A prosperous and competitive Europe the green and digital transitions, including a genuine energy union and investment in game-changing digital technologies in Europe through in skills, training and education."

DPE welcomes the opportunity to share our views on key focus areas for the Irish Presidency, and stands ready to actively support its priorities throughout the mandate. Simplification of the European Digital Rulebook Ireland is uniquely positioned to focus on enhancing Europe’s competitiveness by improving the coherence and implementation of the EU’s digital rulebook. The Digital Omnibus and upcoming Digital Fitness Check are valuable opportunities to streamline requirements, enable consistent enforcement, and reduce complexity for businesses and authorities alike. In recent years, the EU has developed a comprehensive set of frameworks governing digital platforms, including those facilitating local commerce, through landmark legislation such as the AI Act, the Platform Work Directive (PWD) and the GDPR. These rules form a strong foundation, yet their rapid accumulation has also created complexity and occasional overlaps. We welcome the focus on simplification as it enhances regulatory clarity, boosts certainty for businesses, and enables the sustainable growth of local economies across Europe. DPE strongly supports prioritising digital regulatory coherence through the upcoming Digital Omnibus and the wider Digital Fitness Check, to reduce fragmentation across the existing rulebook, promote consistent enforcement among Member States, and deliver a more competitive EU digital framework. Promote a targeted and evidence-based approach in upcoming flagship files Ireland’s Presidency will coincide with the negotiation of several major files shaping the environment in which local commerce platforms operate, including the EU Delivery Act (Q3 2026), the Digital Fairness Act (Q4 2026), and the recently published Digital Omnibus. We invite the Irish presidency to approach these and other key files in a targeted, evidence-based manner to support digital growth, investment and entrepreneurship. Sound impact assessments and evaluation of practical implications help ensure that new rules address genuine gaps without duplicating obligations already covered under the current EU framework. Furthermore, constructive and structured dialogue with industry experts should complement the process by grounding policy choices in real-world experience and operational realities. DPE stands ready to provide insights that support balanced, future-proof outcomes for businesses, consumers and local economies across Europe. Enable local commerce to thrive across the EU Ireland can position itself as a strong advocate for Europe’s local economies by prioritising policies that empower SMEs to thrive in an increasingly digital marketplace. Last-mile delivery and local commerce platforms are considered essential by a large share of European SMEs. Platforms like DPE members allow small businesses to reach new customers, access digital storefronts without costly expansion, and stay competitive in a rapidly changing retail environment. By fostering proportionate, innovation-friendly rules and reducing unnecessary administrative burden, the Irish Presidency can strengthen Europe’s local commerce ecosystem. Ensuring regulatory coherence across borders and recognising the role of digital platforms in providing flexible earning opportunities and supporting proximity-based commerce will be key to building resilient, vibrant local economies across the EU."
246,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/677d4703/Delivery_Platforms_Europe_DPE_-_Submission_246.docx,Delivery Platforms Europe,European Business Association,Local delivery platforms,,2,"The Irish Presidency can play a key role in advancing major pieces of legislation which will greatly impact the competitiveness and productivity of the EU Single Market. From DPE’s perspective the Irish Presidency should focus on: 1. Digital Omnibus and Digital Fitness Check The Irish Presidency will play a decisive role in preparing and developing the Council's negotiating mandate for the Digital Omnibus proposal, presenting a unique opportunity to spearhead the simplification and streamlining of key parts of the digital acquis. In parallel, the Digital Fitness Check will require thorough assessment of remaining gaps and inconsistencies across the broader digital framework. Ensuring that these two processes reinforce one another, rather than introduce additional uncertainty, will be essential to futureproof the overall framework. Thus, DPE invites the Presidency to: Strengthen the harmonisation of the EU data acquis by addressing remaining inconsistencies between recent data sharing and privacy legislation and the GDPR, which currently create bottlenecks and undermine legal clarity for companies and users. Uphold the horizontal nature of the GDPR when implementing sectoral laws such as the AI Act or Platform Work Directive, ensuring that core definitions and safeguards remain aligned to avoid duplicative obligations and enable streamlined, effective compliance. 2. Delivery Act The EU Delivery Act will be presented by the Commission in Q3 2026. DPE is of the view that the Act should focus on the needs of postal operators and avoid extending its scope to fundamentally different business models, such as local commerce platforms, that operate hyper-locally, do not use postal networks, and already comply with extensive EU consumer protection and digital regulations that provide comprehensive user protections. Broadening the scope would risk regulatory duplication and undermine the Commission’s stated aim of simplifying postal and parcel rules as well as the Commission’s broader ambition to reduce regulatory complexity across the Single Market. DPE maintains that broadening the current postal framework to all types of delivery models, regardless of their nature, would result in overlaps and conflicting obligations, ultimately reducing clarity for all stakeholders. This would be detrimental for consumers and businesses alike, weakening safeguards and slowing down innovation. 3. Digital Fairness Act Another major legislative initiative to be presented during the Irish Presidency will be the Digital Fairness Act (DFA). This proposal is likely to introduce new rules and obligations in an already dense and overlapping regulatory framework. Given the extensive consumer protection safeguards already embedded in the EU’s digital acquis, the Irish Presidency has an opportunity to advance the EU’s simplification agenda by ensuring that the DFA builds on existing legislation and streamlines obligations rather than creating new layers of complexity. Strengthening enforcement by competent authorities, through consistent interpretation, coordinated oversight, and clear guidance, will be essential to achieving their effective application across the Union."

As several key legislative files advance, Ireland has a unique opportunity to reduce regulatory complexity, streamline overlapping frameworks and ensure that new obligations are proportionate and grounded in real-world needs. By prioritising these principles, the Presidency can support the economic growth of local commerce platforms, key drivers of proximity-based commerce, as well as digitalisation of SMEs. DPE members help local economies thrive by connecting consumers with neighbourhood shops, fostering a dynamic ecosystem that drives local growth and fuels innovation, job creation, as well as broader economic prosperity. Ensuring a clear, coherent and future-proof regulatory environment will benefit businesses, consumers and communities across the whole EU. By reducing red tape, promoting cross-border regulatory coherence and safeguarding space for digital entrepreneurship, Ireland can position itself as a champion of Europe’s local economies. A Presidency focused on enabling local commerce platforms to grow responsibly will contribute directly to strengthening competitiveness, empowering SMEs and delivering tangible advantages for citizens in their daily lives."

In local commerce and last-mile delivery, DPE members have long offered flexible work opportunities that match people’s needs and availability, and we hope the Irish Presidency similarly sees that these are essential pillars of a modern, resilient labour market. At the same time, experience with the Platform Work Directive, AI Act and GDPR shows that well-intended legislation can unintentionally burden core aspects of the highly flexible work arrangements it aims to protect, and we therefore encourage careful consideration of practical impacts as the Act develops. In this context, we are rather concerned about the risk of additional AI or algorithmic management obligations being layered on top of the aforementioned policies, especially while Member States are still busy transposing and implementing obligations on a national level, and further clarifications from the Commission are needed. We urge the Commission and Presidency to prioritise consistent national implementation, legal certainty and the avoidance of regulatory duplication that could undermine sustainable, flexible job models across Europe."

Ireland’s leading role in Open Science, notably as a leader when it comes to open science monitoring, as well as its exemplary public library network are strengths that should be celebrated. In particular, we therefore believe that the Irish Presidency can help: Ensure that the ERA Act achieves its goal of supporting the fifth freedom and the ‘Choose Europe’ agenda by taking an ambitious but targeted approach. Issues such as copyright should not be left out of the Act because of inter-service issues, but rather addressed from the perspective of what will best serve Europe’s research performance. Correct the anomaly that currently exists in EU law that offers protections both to individual consumers and businesses when seeking to access data and knowledge, but not the libraries and research institutions on which researchers, learners, educators and readers depend.

The priorities proposed in this submission aim to do just this, through: Enabling students, researchers and staff at universities and beyond to face lower administrative burdens and make a reality of a European Research Area. Such reforms will help demonstrate the benefits of EU membership in the academic and research community. Ensure that library users – from public library users in towns and villages to researchers in major institutions – are no longer faced with the non-availability of books or sub-optimal access because of a failure to regulate digital content markets for libraries. This should trigger better services, as well as better use of public sector resources, and be easily communicable at local level. Promote a public event celebrating the results of the OMC process on libraries under the Culture Work Programme. With sufficient media attention, this has the potential to show citizens that the EU is supporting the work of intensely local institutions – something that is a reality for them."
157,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b4c99eb8/Individual_submission_-_Submission_157.docx,,Individual,Retired,Small town in rural area.,1,"For its 2026 EU Presidency, Ireland should prioritise sustainable energy, rural resilience, and community-centred governance. In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
157,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b4c99eb8/Individual_submission_-_Submission_157.docx,,Individual,Retired,Small town in rural area.,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
157,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b4c99eb8/Individual_submission_-_Submission_157.docx,,Individual,Retired,Small town in rural area.,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri-investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry-specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

These thematics support the European Council’s Strategic Agenda for the Union 2024–2029, which calls for strengthening resilience, promoting healthier societies, and accelerating the digital and green transitions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention contributes to all three thematics by reducing chronic disease burden, supporting sustainable health systems, and leveraging digital innovation, including AI and health data infrastructure. The proposed focus areas also align with the European Commission Work Programme for 2026, which prioritises health security, digital transformation, implementation of existing legislative frameworks (including the European Health Data Space), and action on the growing burden of chronic diseases. Ireland’s Presidency can further advance priorities expected to be reflected in the Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2026, particularly improving access to healthcare, reducing inequalities, and strengthening the public health dimension of EU policy. CVD remains the leading cause of mortality across the EU, yet up to 80% of these deaths are preventable through population level strategies in combination with primary prevention, early detection of disease and secondary prevention and rehabilitation. Reversing metabolic risk factors in young adults through development of healthy choices and improved awareness will build resiliency. Ireland’s Presidency offers a timely opportunity to lead on Europe-wide prevention policy through the implementation of the forthcoming EU Cardiovascular Health Plan, reinforcing the EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024–2029. 1. “A Healthier Future for All” – Embedding Prevention Across the EU Policy Agenda Champion prevention as a cross-cutting EU priority. Drawing on Ireland’s experience with the Integrated Prevention and Management of Chronic Disease, the Enhanced Community Care programme, and established chronic disease pathways, Ireland is well positioned to support EU-level consensus on system-wide prevention measures. NIPC has a strong track record in the design, delivery, and evaluation of preventive cardiology programmes across both primary and secondary prevention, working in close partnership with the HSE and clinical services nationwide. Ireland, through NIPC, has also made a sustained contribution to EUwide prevention intelligence and benchmarking through participation in major ESC-led surveys, including EUROASPIRE and INTERASPIRE, providing robust real-world evidence on cardiovascular risk factor management, implementation gaps, and health inequalities across Europe. Key elements include: Life-course approaches to cardiovascular and metabolic health Strong EU action on tobacco, alcohol, nutrition, environmental exposures, and physical activity, with a focus on chronic disease management and CVD co-morbidities, including obesity and diabetes Strengthened health literacy and public engagement across Member States 2. “Equity and Access” – Reducing the EU’s Cardiovascular Health Inequalities Inequities based on socioeconomic status, gender, region, and immigration status continue to shape cardiovascular outcomes across Europe. Ireland should prioritise EU-level policies that: Embed equity in CVD prevention, screening, rehabilitation, early diagnosis and access to treatment Support gender-sensitive approaches to women’s cardiovascular health Strengthen access for vulnerable, rural, and multimorbid populations 3. “Data, Innovation, and Integrated Care” – Enabling Europe’s Transition to Modern Preventive Health Systems Ireland can lead by championing: Implementation of the European Health Data Space for real-time monitoring, benchmarking, and research Ethical integration of AI in prevention, early detection, and care delivery Digital–in-person hybrid models for cardiac rehabilitation and chronic disease management Strengthened multinational research networks These priorities reflect approaches showcased by Irish and international experts at national prevention conferences and are strongly aligned with the European Society of Cardiology’s advocacy agenda, with which NIPC maintains a close strategic partnership across prevention, research, education, and policy. Ireland also has a proven track record in preventive health leadership, including the world-leading 2004 smoking ban and the early establishment of chronic disease community hubs as a “third way” of delivering integrated care. Together with NIPC’s prevention delivery expertise and ESC collaboration, these achievements demonstrate Ireland’s readiness to lead the implementation phase of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan, which aligns with NIPC’s ongoing collaboration with national stakeholders, the Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officer, the HSE, and Ministerial priorities, positioning Ireland as an exemplar in cardiovascular prevention."

The focus on early detection, digital transformation, chronic disease management, equity, and workforce capability corresponds closely to the EU’s strategic direction for the next legislative cycle. Ireland should use its Presidency to champion and operationalise the adoption of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan at EU and national levels. NIPC recommends prioritising EU-wide progress in the following areas: 1. Establish EU Standards for Early Detection of CVD Ireland should lead negotiations on the development of: EU protocols for cardiovascular health checks Early detection pathways for high-risk individuals AI-enabled risk prediction tools integrated with clinical pathways A structured EU approach would significantly improve early detection and treatment and reduce preventable morbidity. 2. Advance Legislation Supporting Population-Level Prevention Ireland should work with EPSCO to strengthen or initiate EU policy action on: Tobacco control (including novel nicotine products) Alcohol minimum pricing alignment and cross-border restrictions Nutrition labelling reform and food-system measures Urban design and physical activity promotion These align with EU Green Deal priorities and Healthy Lifestyles initiatives. 3. Promote EU-wide Access to High-Quality Secondary Prevention & Cardiac Rehabilitation Ireland should seek Council conclusions or policy agreements that: Mandate equitable access to evidence-based CVD prevention and rehabilitation programmes Encourage menu-based, flexible models (including digital options) Support Member State capacity-building for multidisciplinary care 4. Support Implementation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) for Cardiovascular Health Ireland should prioritise: Harmonised data standards for cardiovascular outcomes EU-wide CVD registries and benchmarking tools Real-world evidence frameworks Cross-border research infrastructure 5. Workforce & Training: Advancing Preventive Cardiology in Europe Ireland should highlight: The absence of accredited preventive cardiology training pathways Workforce shortages in prevention across Member States The need for an EU-level competency framework This will support long-term system resilience and implementation of the EU Plan. In parallel, NIPC emphasises that Ireland must advance its own national Cardiovascular Health Plan and Strategy to ensure alignment between domestic priorities and EU-Presidency ambitions."

Together, these partners provide clinical, public health, implementation, and patient-centred expertise. A unified Irish position signals to the EU that Ireland can convene, coordinate, and accelerate Member State readiness for implementation. This multi-stakeholder model directly benefits EU citizens by driving: Faster detection of high-risk individuals Increased access to rehabilitation services Reduced health inequalities Lower system-level costs over time Stronger alignment between national and EU public health strategies Ireland’s demonstrated ability to deliver population-level health reforms (e.g., smoking ban, integrated care hubs, shift-left prevention policies) underscores its readiness to serve as a European exemplar in implementing the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan and a national Cardiovascular Health Strategy. By championing cardiovascular prevention through these collaborative, people-centred approaches, Ireland will advance goals identified in the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and strengthen implementation of initiatives foreseen within the Commission Work Programme 2026—ultimately maximising the impact of Ireland’s Presidency for citizens, communities, and health systems across the Union."

NIPC wishes to highlight the following additional points for consideration: Ireland is uniquely positioned to lead on cardiovascular prevention at EU level. Ireland’s experience in integrated community care, chronic disease programmes, national audits, and digital innovation provides a strong foundation for shaping the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. The EU Cardiovascular Health Plan should reflect the principles outlined in NIPC’s evidence submission. These include: Life-course approach to prevention Structured CVD screening and early detection EU-wide standards for secondary prevention and rehabilitation Embedding equity as a core pillar Workforce development in preventive cardiology Leveraging research, data, the EHDS, and AI Robust evaluation and continuous audit frameworks Ireland’s 2026 Presidency can serve as a launchpad for EU-wide health transformation. A strategic focus on prevention will: Reduce the burden of chronic disease Strengthen health system sustainability Promote innovation and digital health adoption Improve outcomes across all socioeconomic groups Enhance Ireland’s international leadership profile Integrating learnings from national and international experts. Insights from the National Prevention & Integrated Diabetes Care Conference—including those on multimorbidity, digital rehabilitation, women’s health, AI, lipid and hypertension management, and upstream prevention—support a contemporary roadmap for EU action. To achieve this, a unified national voice is required. NIPC strongly recommends that Ireland’s Presidency response is explicitly aligned with: NIPC Croí Heart & Stroke Irish Cardiac Society (ICS) Irish Heart Foundation • These organisations previously collaborated on the NIPC/ICS/IHF position paper “Advancing a Prevention Agenda for Cardiovascular Care in Ireland,” which called for a coordinated National Cardiovascular Prevention Strategy. The absence of such a strategy remains the single biggest barrier to Ireland fully implementing—and credibly championing—the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. This approach is consistent with the wider ambitions of the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, supports effective implementation of legislative commitments in the 2026 Commission Work Programme, and anticipates the shared priorities to be endorsed in the Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2026. By aligning national efforts with these EU-wide strategic orientations, Ireland can help ensure that cardiovascular prevention becomes a central pillar of Europe’s health and social policy agenda. With a national Cardiovascular Health Plan and Strategy—adapted from the EACH CV Health Plan blueprint, and aligned with Department of Health and Ministerial priorities—Ireland can again lead Europe, just as it did with the 2004 smoking ban and, more recently, with its shift-left wellness agenda and investment in integrated care hubs and chronic disease structures. Ireland is well placed to serve as a European exemplar for modern prevention-led cardiovascular policy during its EU Presidency."

In an era in which multilateralism is becoming eroded and social cohesion is coming under increased pressure, Ireland is uniquely placed to position itself as “Experts in Partnership”, and to illustrate the “Power of Partnership” to achieve positive and lasting change. In particular, we encourage a focus on the role that Partnership plays in making local communities in Ireland and across Europe more vibrant, cohesive, and sustainable. In this context, Partnership involves collaboration across multiple levels (local, national, EU) and sectors (government, civil society, and the private sector), but in all cases should involve – and revolve around the needs of – people and communities. Ireland has an excellent track record in this area, exemplified by the work of the Local Development Companies, who are eager to support Government in using the upcoming presidency to showcase the important role that the EU plays as an enabler of local and community development. This role will be illustrated through the work of programmes like LEADER and SICAP, both of which are co-funded by Ireland and the EU and delivered at a local level by the LDCs. Please follow the following links for an overview of some of the projects and initiatives that these programmes support: LEADER / SICAP. Why the theme of “Partnership”? “Partnership” speaks directly to the international persona that Ireland has long worked to project – in the EU and at the UN, Ireland aims to be an “honest broker”, leveraging its long-standing neutrality and diplomatic record to promote peace, unity, and multilateralism. “Partnership” speaks to our cultural history – one in which the spirit of meitheal underpins a strong collective ethos within communities. The concept of meitheal continues to resonate as a rallying call for communities to stand together, as was proven during Covid-19 and following the Storm Eowyn response. “Partnership” speaks to the overarching need to bring the EU closer to its citizens and to its communities – and this presidency presents an opportunity to show how EU supports (e.g., LEADER and SICAP) are having a real and visible impact in people’s lives. “Partnership” and the EU Council’s Strategic Agenda The theme of “Partnership” can be used as a connecting thread to bind together a number of key strands of the EU Council’s Strategic Agenda. These are set out below. Across these pillars and themes, the theme of “Advancing Together” is the one that speaks most directly to the concept of Partnership, both in a general sense and in the more specific context of local and community development. Some of the central precepts of this theme are: That economic growth should benefit all citizens. That the green and digital transitions should be equitable and inclusive. That the EU and its members will invest in the skills, training and education of its citizens. That the EU and its members will commit to social dialogue, uphold equal opportunities, and reduce inequalities."

This Strategy will be accompanied by a Child Guarantee that will include investments and reforms aimed specifically at tackling child poverty. Ireland is well-positioned to play a leading role in these areas, given 1) that Ireland has always been regarded as a prominent international voice in the area of poverty reduction and 2) the Child Poverty and Well-being Programme Office, which is housed within the Department of the Taoiseach, was established to achieve the same basic objective as the Child Guarantee – the elimination of child poverty – and learnings from Ireland’s experience should be disseminated and embedded in the policies of our European peers. Ireland’s next Roadmap for Social Inclusion will be published in advance of our Presidency commencing; making poverty a central plank of our Presidency will generate important early momentum for that policy. Ireland’s presidency will coincide with a pivotal phase of negotiations for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework, and it should use the platform afforded by the presidency to make the case for its policy and budgetary priorities. Rural Development – specifically the LEADER programme – should be a central focus of these advocacy efforts. Under the MFF Proposals set out by the European Commission last summer, no provisions are made for funding for LEADER/Community-led Local Development (CLLD) to be ringfenced, creating the possibility of much-diminished LEADER programmes across EU member states post-2027. LEADER is an established and effective tool for rural development, and any further diminution of LEADER would represent a significant blow to rural communities, and an effective abandonment of the EU Long-term Vision for Rural Areas, which was intended to serve as a framework for rural development in Europe through 2040. A key objective of Ireland’s Presidency – aligned to the Programme for Government commitment to “engage at EU level to increase funding for the next LEADER programme” – should therefore be to ensure that funding for LEADER/CLLD continues to be ringfenced within the MFF. Given that LEADER is both an enabler and an embodiment of the kind of community-led partnership which we hope will serve as an overarching theme of Ireland’s EU Presidency, we hope that Ireland will use its presidency to argue not only for the retention of LEADER programme, but for the mainstreaming of the LEADER methodology (characterized by bottom-up, community-led development) across other strands of EU policy, e.g., green transition, food security, demographic renewal."

It is through this approach that “Europe” shifts from something that people regard as cold, bureaucratic and remote to something that people can see, value, and feel part of. Ireland has the institutional infrastructure to do this – much of which has been touched upon already in this submission. Over the past 35 years or so, Ireland has developed an area-based development model, with LDCs to the fore, which is holistic, professional, and community-led. Although programmes like LEADER may be just as important in other European countries as they are in Ireland, Ireland is unusual in that the entities tasked with delivering LEADER (the LDCs) also deliver a broad range of complementary programmes, enabling them to take a much broader view of the needs and capabilities of the communities that they serve. These programmes are predicated on the trusted partnerships that LDCs have forged with a diverse array of government departments, statutory agencies, civil society organisations, and community groups. In this way, grassroots supports can be delivered across a range of thematic areas – including employment and training, enterprise and social enterprise, health and wellbeing, migrant integration, and climate and the environment – in a way that is cohesive and symbiotic. Ireland should use the platform of its presidency both to strengthen this model and to showcase it – as an exemplar of “Partnership in Practice” – to its EU peers."

This summary should also be limited to a maximum of 500 words. In using the word “citizen” in this submission, we are mindful that not all of those currently residing in Ireland and Europe are European citizens. Indeed, it is important that Ireland’s vision for the presidency takes account of the needs and circumstances of those that are not citizens. Through the Cork Declaration (1996) and the Cork Declaration 2.0 (2016), Ireland has earned a unique place in the history of the EU’s rural development policy. Ireland’s presidency will fall ten years on from the second Cork Declaration, and – given the uncertainty that the MFF proposals have generated for LEADER and other rural development instruments – consideration could be given to re-affirming Europe’s commitment to its rural areas via a Cork Declaration 3.0. About LDCN Local Development Companies Network (LDCN) is the national representative body for Local Development Companies (LDCs) in Ireland. LDCs were first established by government in 1991. Since then, their geographical coverage has expanded to the entire 26 counties, and the range of services and supports that they deliver has grown and evolved alongside the needs of the communities that they serve. However, their collective mission has remained consistent: to build a more just, inclusive, and equitable society. They share a vision of an Ireland in which everyone – regardless of where they live, their economic situation, their disability status, or their gender, ethnicity, or age – can build a life of dignity, fulfilment, and connection. They pursue this mission across multiple strands of work, including social inclusion, education, training and employment supports, early years and family supports, urban and rural development, and just transition.

In light of the draft EU Cardiovascular Health (CVH) Plan, three interconnected themes stand out as strategically important: (1) Leadership on cardiovascular health and early detection, (2) Enabling innovation through modernised MedTech regulation, and (3) Advancing value-based, innovation-friendly procurement. 1. Leadership on Cardiovascular Health and Early Detection Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the EU, with significant inequalities in prevention, screening and access to care. The draft EU CVH Plan identifies prevention, early detection and improved care pathways as core EU-level priorities. Ireland’s Presidency can play a central role in accelerating these efforts by championing a high-level focus on early detection and screening, including for Structural Heart Disease, an area where underdiagnosis is widespread. A presidency priority centred on cardiovascular health would support: Implementation of the proposed EU Protocol on Health Checks, enabling harmonised, scalable approaches to blood pressure, lipid, diabetes and structural heart assessments. Support the establishment of an EU Network of Centers of Cardiovascular Excellence to improve patient access, enhance efficiency and capacity in care, and strengthen clinical and innovation excellence in Europe Develop EU Guidance for patient pathways to improve access to referral, treatment and monitoring for enhanced patient management and care. A focus on equity, ensuring screening and prevention reach underserved and ageing populations. Such a priority would align the Presidency with the EU’s targets for 2035, including reducing CVD mortality by 20% and ensuring 70–80% detection and control rates for major risk factors. 2. Enabling Innovation Through Modernised MedTech Regulation Europe’s ability to deliver on the CVH Plan depends heavily on an innovation-friendly regulatory ecosystem. The draft Plan acknowledges the essential role of medical technologies in prevention, early detection, minimally invasive treatment and rehabilitation. Ireland—home to one of Europe’s largest MedTech clusters—is well positioned to lead on: Ensuring revisions to the Medical Device and IVD Regulations to simplify procedures and accelerate access to high-value cardiovascular technologies are progressed as swiftly as possible. The adoption of the new breakthrough device pathway, particularly relevant for implantable and structural heart interventions; that will ensure predictability and certainty. This focus would improve patient access, reduce regulatory bottlenecks and reinforce EU competitiveness in life sciences. 3. Advancing Value-Based Health Procurement The CVH Plan explicitly highlights the need to align financial incentives with prevention, early detection and improved long-term outcomes. Ireland can help modernise procurement approaches by prioritising: Expansion of value-based procurement frameworks that reward outcomes and lifecycle value. More effective joint procurement models for high-impact technologies. Greater inclusion of SMEs and innovative suppliers. Such reforms would accelerate adoption of life-saving cardiovascular innovations and support sustainable healthcare spending across Member States."
192,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a5abe7a1/Edwards_Lifesciences_-_Submission_192.docx,Edwards Lifesciences,Business,Health,EU Wide,2,"Ireland’s 2026 Presidency presents a timely opportunity to advance policies that strengthen health system resilience, support innovation and improve patient outcomes across the EU. In line with the draft EU Cardiovascular Health (CVH) Plan, four policy areas should be prioritised: (1) EU-level leadership on cardiovascular health and early detection, (2) targeted modernisation of MedTech regulation, (3) reform of procurement frameworks toward outcomes and innovation and; (4) Support these policy areas with funding from the MFF. 1. Advancing EU Action on Cardiovascular Health and Early Detection The draft CVH Plan proposes major EU initiatives—including a Council Recommendation on health checks, a screening protocol, and digital and AI-enabled detection tools—to reduce CVD mortality and achieve ambitious 2035 detection and control targets. Ireland can accelerate political agreement on these elements. The Presidency should aim to: Secure Council Recommendation endorsing the EU Protocol on Health Checks and encouraging Member States to implement harmonised approaches to detecting hypertension, and Structural Heart Disease. Including setting framework for patient pathways guidance and the creation of cardiovascular centres of excellence Support scalable community-based detection models, including mobile screening units. Advance discussions on interoperable cardiovascular registries, supporting the CVH Plan’s digital and data flagship initiatives. Support EU4Health and Horizon Europe funding streams focused on early diagnosis. These steps would reduce inequalities across Member States and anchor cardiovascular disease firmly within the broader European Health Union framework. 2. Strengthening and Modernising MedTech Regulation The draft CVH Plan recognises the essential role of medical technologies in diagnosis, treatment and personalised care, and highlights forthcoming reforms to the Medical Device and IVD Regulations to simplify procedures and improve patient access. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise: Secure a Council position on targeted revisions to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), including clearer timelines, proportionate requirements and improved pathways for breakthrough cardiovascular devices. Advancing measures to expand and strengthen notified body capacity, ensuring more consistent and timely assessments. Facilitating implementation of the new Critical Medicines Act and forthcoming Biotech Act where relevant to cardiovascular health technologies. These actions would improve predictability for manufacturers, reduce bottlenecks and enhance Europe’s global competitiveness in life-saving innovation. 3. Public Procurement Reform to Support Value-Based and Innovative Care The CVH Plan emphasises the need for financial frameworks that reward long-term prevention, early detection and efficient care pathways. Current procurement models—often centred on lowest price—limit the uptake of high-value technologies. Ireland should therefore aim to: Consider a specific section for public procurement of healthcare goods and services in the upcoming revision of the directive, that address the need to timely deliver healthcare to EU citizens, with a dedicated process for breakthrough implantable devices. Enhance strategic procurement and early dialogue with MedTech Innovators together with relevant stakeholders to jointly define the need to procure and establish true partnership through co-creation of medical solutions. The recommendations of the EU4Health project PROCURE should be leveraged in this regard. Foster Value-Based procurement and Public Procurement of Innovation to reflect patient’s outcomes and healthcare efficiency gains, leveraging HTA bodies to assess holistic value of breakthrough implantable devices, and enhance capacity and resilience of healthcare systems. Simplify procurement procedures and flexibility to incorporate value breakthrough implantable devices into tender lifecycles to reflect innovations lifecycles, by linking adoption to RWD/RWE. These reforms would accelerate equitable access to early detection tools, digital health solutions and evidence-based treatments. 4. Support the policy initiatives with funding from the MFF The new MFF will commence in 2028 and the Irish Presidency supports an opportunity to place the building blocks for the new EU Budget. It is an opportunity to ensure funding for the initiatives to support the EU CVH can be put in place at an early stage and so that the plan can deliver on its ambitions."

Aligning with the draft EU Cardiovascular Health (CVH) Plan, three areas stand out as offering the greatest potential impact: improved cardiovascular prevention and early detection, a modernised and innovation-enabling regulatory ecosystem and procurement systems that reward better outcomes and long-term value. 1. Improving Health Outcomes Through Prevention and Early Detection Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the EU, driving health inequalities and significant economic losses. The draft CVH Plan outlines an EU-wide shift towards prevention, screening and personalised care. The Irish Presidency can help turn this vision into measurable progress by advancing: The EU Protocol on Health Checks, promoting harmonised screening for hypertension, diabetes, lipid disorders, obesity and Structural Heart Disease—conditions that often go undetected until serious events occur. Support for mobile and community-based screening models, improving access for rural, ageing and underserved communities. Implementation of digital and AI-enabled tools for early detection and personalised risk prediction, as prioritised in the CVH Plan’s data and digital flagship initiatives. Delivering progress in these areas would reduce premature deaths, support healthier ageing and narrow outcome gaps across Member States—clear and visible benefits for communities. 2. Strengthening Innovation and Supporting Europe’s MedTech Ecosystem The MedTech sector is essential to Europe’s competitiveness, but current regulatory bottlenecks—especially in the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) framework—risk slowing innovation and patient access. The draft CVH Plan highlights the importance of simplifying regulatory processes, accelerating access to breakthrough devices and supporting digital tools. During its Presidency, Ireland can make a substantial contribution by progressing: Secure a Council position on targeted revisions to the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), including clearer timelines, proportionate requirements and improved pathways for breakthrough cardiovascular devices. Advancing measures to expand and strengthen notified body capacity, ensuring more consistent and timely assessments. Facilitating implementation of the new Critical Medicines Act and forthcoming Biotech Act where relevant to cardiovascular health technologies. These initiatives will strengthen Europe’s life sciences sector, protect high-quality jobs and enable faster introduction of technologies that improve patient outcomes. 3. Advancing Value-Based, Innovation-Friendly Procurement Procurement reform is a powerful lever to improve efficiency, accelerate adoption of innovation and promote long-term health system sustainability. The draft CVH Plan recognises the need to align financing mechanisms with prevention and improved care pathways. Ireland can help shape a more forward-looking approach by promoting: Value-based procurement frameworks that reward quality, outcomes and lifecycle value rather than lowest price. Strategic and joint procurement for high-impact cardiovascular technologies, reducing disparities across Member States. Greater participation of SMEs and innovative suppliers in EU tenders. These improvements would support innovation, make health systems more efficient and ensure patients receive the best available care."

The Presidency year provides a unique platform to demonstrate the EU’s practical impact on daily life, highlight Ireland’s leadership within Europe and strengthen citizens’ confidence in the EU as a force for stability, prosperity and shared progress. 1. Make EU Benefits Tangible and Locally Relevant Citizens engage most strongly when they see the EU’s value in concrete terms. Communication efforts should highlight clear, relatable examples of how EU membership improves quality of life in areas such as healthcare, consumer protection, workers’ rights, digital security, climate action and regional investment. Ireland should: Use case studies and real stories to show how EU policies have delivered benefits—from cheaper mobile roaming to improved healthcare access, reduced air pollution and investment in Irish towns, universities and public services. Highlight how the Irish Presidency’s priorities—such as improved health outcomes, innovation in MedTech and value-based public services—directly impact communities. Emphasise how EU membership amplifies Ireland’s influence globally and supports our economic resilience. By bringing EU achievements into local conversations, citizens can better see the relevance of EU action in their everyday lives. 2. Create Opportunities for Citizen Participation and Dialogue Ownership grows when citizens feel heard and included. The Irish Presidency should champion open, participatory engagement that encourages discussion, feedback and involvement from people of all backgrounds. Key actions include: Organising regional townhall events, school engagement initiatives and community dialogues to discuss EU priorities and gather citizen views. Partnering with universities, civil society organisations and youth groups to host debates, innovation challenges and policy workshops during the Presidency. Promote EU-funded training opportunities and illustrate how EU membership supports personal and professional development. Creating accessible online platforms where citizens can learn about Presidency activities, contribute ideas and follow policy discussions in real time. This participatory approach helps citizens recognise their role in shaping Ireland’s contribution to the EU’s future direction. 3. Communicate Through Trusted, Diverse Channels Effective communication requires reaching people through channels they trust. A mix of traditional and digital media, creative content and targeted outreach will be essential. Ireland should: Use social media strategically to share short, engaging content explaining EU decisions, their benefits and Ireland’s leadership role. Work with local radio, regional newspapers and community organisations to broaden reach and connect with citizens in rural and urban areas alike. Develop clear, jargon-free messaging to demystify EU processes and explain what the Presidency actually entails. Highlight the Irish Presidency as a national achievement, showcasing Irish expertise, diplomacy and influence. 4. Celebrate Ireland’s Place in the European Story Finally, the Presidency period should reinforce the idea that Ireland is an active, shaping member of the EU—not simply a beneficiary of it.

High Level Priorities 1.) Focus on Social Inclusion and Implementation of European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan leading to a more inclusive Europe. A key opportunity is to advance implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR) , pushing Member States to reduce poverty and address important issues via the following mechanisms: Progress EU Anti-Poverty Strategy. Prioritise Child Poverty and Reinforce the EU Child Guarantee. Progress EU Affordable Housing Plan and Combatting homelessness. Support implementation of EU Disability Rights Strategy (2021-2030) and address the Disability Employment Gap. Support Rural & Regional Inclusion See further details on these priorities in response to Question 2. 2) Implementation of EU Green Deal and Ensuring a Just Transition Support the acceleration of climate action and advancing the just transition, circular economies, and sustainable production and supply chains.  Ensure a Just Transition through a comprehensive Just Transition Policy framework ‘To ensure that nobody is left behind by the Green Deal and ensure a just transition, there needs to be greater attention given to the impact climate change legislation will have on women, persons with disabilities, ethnic minority groups, elderly, children, people living in poverty and young people. The European Commission should promote a full impact assessment of green legislation on marginalised groups to mitigate the detrimental social impacts and see how they are connected to the European Pillar of Social Rights.’ Enhancing the Social Climate Fund Social Climate Fund - Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion would help to make the green transition more inclusive by supporting vulnerable people and small businesses who are most affected by rising energy and transport costs, as Europe moves towards climate neutrality. Supporting the implementation of the European Council recommendation on the fair transition to climate neutrality EUR-Lex - 32022H0627(04) - EN - EUR-Lex would also support achieving the Just Transition objectives. It may be worth considering using the Environmental Protection Agency’s framework as a mechanism for assessing impact of the Just Transition. This would entail examining: a)Distributional justice (allocation of costs and benefits) b)Procedural justice (who participates in decision-making) c)Recognitional justice (respect for, engagement with and fair consideration of diverse cultures and perspectives) See Delivering justice in sustainability transitions | Publications | European Environment Agency (EEA)  Mainstream Climate across all EU spending and invest in Climate Capacity Building Consideration should be given to making climate conditionalities more ambitious in Cohesion Policy post-2027 to build on the progress of the Just Transition Mechanism 21-27 and investment in climate capacity building. From managing several climate and social inclusion programmes, Pobal believes that not all potential stakeholders are viewing their work through the climate lens or recognising new climate funding streams as potentially relevant for them. From our experience of grant administration, we see a real need for investment in climate capacity building at a local level. This could occur through knowledge exchange and exploration to ensure the full range of relevant partners are engaged. Specifically, we should not assume that all local actors see the relationship between social inclusion and climate justice, or that they can seamlessly integrate climate considerations into existing local economic development or social inclusion plans and initiatives. There would also be value in considering the following:  JUST TRANSITION: SUPPORTING PEOPLE AND REGIONS Expanding the Just Transition Fund scope post-2027 o Extending beyond coal regions to include carbon-intensive industrial areas, regions with high energy poverty and remote and rural areas vulnerable to energy shocks. Protecting workers and communities o Funding reskilling into renewable energy, digital services and circular economy industries. Affordable energy for households o Supporting energy-poor households through deep renovation grants, heat pump schemes and community power projects. A recent research report commissioned by Pobal indicates that households in the most disadvantaged areas are almost five times less likely to use renewable energy than those in more affluent communities. The findings reveal a need to address inequality gaps across Irish communities to support a fairer energy transition.

Ireland could aim to: Advance Council conclusions that reinforce Member States’ commitment to reducing poverty and child deprivation and support the development of the forthcoming EU Anti-Poverty Strategy to address the root causes of poverty. According to the Social Platform which is the leading network of EU civil society organisations working for a more social Europe 93.3 million people / 21% of the population in the EU were at risk of poverty and social exclusion in 2024 and for children this figure was 24%. It is therefore extremely important that efforts on the poverty reduction target are accelerated. Support Commission initiatives to tackle cost of living increases. Promote investment in social services, housing, and quality jobs. EU Affordable Housing Plan & EU Platform on Combatting Homelessness Ireland could play an important role in supporting greater EU investment in social and affordable housing and also: Enhance supports for the EU Platform on Combatting Homelessness. Push for an EU-wide target to reduce homelessness by 2030. Strengthen access to EU investment mechanisms for social housing such as using ERDF + EIB loans to address the housing crisis. Full Implementation of the EU Child Guarantee Ireland could aim to: Secure Council conclusions urging increased national funding for childcare, education, healthcare, nutrition, and housing supports. Create an inter-country dialogue on best practices in Early Childhood Education and Care, providing an opportunity to share Ireland's work on the Equal Start model. Encourage Member States to address intergenerational poverty and inequalities early.  EU Disability Rights & Accessibility Legislative actions: Implementation of the EU Disability Rights Strategy 2021–2030 Reviewing progress on the European Accessibility Act Ireland could aim to: Advance Council work on stronger accessibility standards (digital public services, transport, built environment). Promote equal labour-market participation for persons with disabilities. Push for EU funding streams to be more disability inclusive.  Labour Market Inclusion & Skills (Green & Digital Transitions) Relevant proposals: Updates to EU Skills Agenda – right to training and lifelong learning. Legislation linked to the Digital Decade targets to create a digitally empowered Europe. • Green transition employment supports Ireland could aim to: Prioritise inclusive upskilling programmes for low-skilled workers, migrants, persons with disabilities, and older workers. Promote Council progress on fair working conditions during automation and digitalisation. o Strengthen EU support for Just Transition regions to prevent regional economic exclusion.  Gender Equality & Work–Life Balance Relevant legislation: Pay Transparency Directive Possible updates to anti-violence or equality frameworks Ireland could aim to: o Drive forward consistent application of pay-transparency rules across Member States. o Encourage progress on EU measures addressing gender-based violence and workplace discrimination. o Promote expansion of family-leave and flexible-work measures."

Highlight the Importance of EU Funding The Presidency presents an opportunity to highlight the tangible positive outcomes that can result from the flow of EU funding to communities most in need, which is evident to Pobal through the EU Co-funded Programmes which we support, and to ensure that such EU funding is recognised as critical for enhancing social inclusion. The national Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) co-funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht (DRCDG) tackles poverty and social exclusion at a local level through local engagement and partnerships between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations and public sector agencies. SICAP is a targeted, holistic programme, for those who are most disadvantaged and less likely to access mainstream services, which provides supports directly to beneficiaries and links them into existing services. In 2024 alone the SICAP Programme supported over 3,000 Community Organisations throughout Ireland including 2,368 Local Community Groups and 473 Social Enterprises in addition to over 32,000 disadvantaged individuals. This EU Co-funded programme which has been running for many years has demonstrated enormous social impact. The Workability Programme co-funded by the Department of Social Protection (which supports people with disabilities to access the labour market) commenced in 2024 and over 13,000 people with a disability are expected to benefit from the programme over its lifetime and so far, 4,585 people have engaged with the programme. Since programme commencement, 1,091 participants have exited the WorkAbility Programme - accounting for 24% of all participants. For those who have exited: 380 (35%) participants found employment. 193 (18%) participants commenced training. Pobal has supported several iterations of the Peace Programmes since the inception of Peace 1 in the early 1990s and sees the enormous benefits that the projects have brought to Northern Ireland and the border counties, which would not have been possible without EU funds. Pobal is currently supporting actions in the PEACEPLUS Changemakes Programme in addition to partnering in the Victims and Survivors and YouthImpact Programmes. Some recent statistics from the Special EU Programmes Body (which demonstrate the value of PEACE funding) on outputs from the PEACE Programmes: 261,662 hours of guidance/counselling sessions 44,037 people attended 1,887 events assisting victims and survivors 25,429 people attended 2,184 conflict resolution workshops 42,540 participants in reconciliation projects 189,007 people attended 8,393 events that addressed sectarianism and racism or dealt with conflict resolution 121,868 children participated in cross-community contact through shared class activity 7-8,000 employment projects delivered 77,652 individuals entered or progressed into education or training Please see suggested priorities for the term as per Question 2 response and additional priorities outlined below: Strengthen Social Economy ecosystems in Europe Address societal challenges and support inclusive societies by strengthening social economy ecosystems and social enterprises in Europe. See recent report from the European Commission & OECD Social Economy in Europe | OECD . Promote Integration and Inclusion in Migration Policy Helping migrants to contribute socially and economically, would reduce exclusion, and lead to more cohesive communities, better labour-market outcomes, and improved social harmony. Overall Added Value of the Irish Presidency The most substantial impact of the Presidency will come from pushing forward existing EU commitments, ensuring that they translate into real improvements on the ground, and fostering consensus on policies that have a strong focus on social fairness. By championing the priorities outlined, the Irish Presidency could deliver substantial positive impact through: A more inclusive and competitive EU economy Linking social inclusion with economic growth ensures that businesses, workers and communities all benefit. Better access to essential services Improved housing, childcare, healthcare and social services strengthen social cohesion. Fairer opportunities for all Targeting vulnerable groups—children, persons with disabilities, migrants, and low-income households helps to build a more equitable society. Stronger communities and regional balance Focusing on rural and urban disparities helps to create a more unified Social Europe."

There would be value in helping citizens to understand not only what the EU does, but how Ireland shapes it and how it impacts their lives, communities and opportunities. Some suggested mechanisms: Make the EU Relevant to Daily Life Citizens engage more when they see concrete benefits. Ireland could emphasise how EU membership delivers in areas people care about by highlighting: The significant impact of EU funding on social inclusion and supporting the most marginalized by demonstrating the tangible positive outcomes that have resulted from the flow of EU funding to communities, as indicated in response to Question 3. Impact of EU funds including investments in infrastructure, regional development and rural areas. Workers’ rights, equality laws and social protections. Lower travel costs, consumer protections and roaming rules. Climate action, clean air, food safety and environmental protections. Student mobility, Erasmus+ and job opportunities across the EU. Communicate the Irish Presidency as a National Opportunity Instead of presenting the Presidency as a technical or diplomatic event, it could be framed as: A moment where Ireland leads and sets the agenda. An opportunity to shape Europe’s future on issues that matter to Irish people. A source of national pride, responsibility and influence. Clear, Accessible, Story-Driven Communication Short videos explaining “What the Presidency means for you”. Real stories of people and communities benefiting from EU projects. Visual explainers on how Council decisions work and Ireland’s role. Engage Young People Directly Young citizens are among the most pro-EU groups but may be less informed about its workings. Ireland could : Expand school and university outreach programmes. Use social media platforms popular with young audiences. Promote Erasmus+, EU careers, internships and youth exchanges. Support youth parliaments, model councils and debating events. Bring EU Discussions into Communities Host local events and conversations outside Dublin: Town-hall meetings, community forums, rural dialogues using community buildings and social enterprise services where possible. Exhibitions or EU information roadshows in regional centres. Collaboration with libraries, community groups schools and local media. Partner with Civil Society, NGOs and Business Networks These sectors can amplify messages and ensure inclusiveness. Partnerships could involve: Chambers of commerce (to highlight business benefits). NGOs working in social inclusion, youth, disability or environment. Universities and think-tanks for public seminars and citizen briefings. Use the Presidency to Highlight Irish Priorities If citizens see national priorities on the EU agenda—such as social inclusion, housing, digital skills, rural development—ownership will increase. Ireland could: Communicate clearly why these priorities matter. Show that Presidency work aligns with the challenges people face. Provide updates on progress in simple, relatable language. 8. Promote Transparency and Two-Way Communication Ireland could: Create public consultations on Presidency themes. Invite citizens to propose questions or topics for EU discussions. Maintain a transparent Presidency website with updates, timelines and results. Overall Strategy To create genuine public ownership of Ireland’s EU Presidency, it would help to ensure that communication is : People-focused — emphasising everyday benefits. Irish-led — highlighting Ireland’s influence and leadership role. Inclusive — reaching all regions, ages and communities. Participatory — involving citizens in shaping and discussing EU priorities. This approach would not only strengthen trust in the EU but would also reinforce Ireland’s position as an engaged, outward-looking member state with citizens who understand and value the role they play in Europe’s future."

According to the European Commission Public procurement accounts for around 14% of EU GDP, so using it strategically could have major social impact. Pobal has significant experience in this area and supported the DRCDG in overseeing the production of a report on Socially Responsible Public Procurement which reviewed best practice from 10 countries worldwide and entailed mapping, analysing and distilling SRRP policy successes, challenges, and trajectories within various local and regional contexts. See link 'Buy social' and Socially Responsible Public Procurement report . Pobal is very active in this space and is a member of a Social Procurement Working Group under the DRCDG’s Trading for Impact Strategy. Hosting such a conference during the Presidency would support Ireland’s agenda in several key ways: Advance Social Inclusion A conference would allow Ireland to highlight procurement as a practical tool to reduce poverty and strengthen labour standards across the EU. This would advance social inclusion goals by showing how public spending can create jobs for disadvantaged groups, support people with disabilities, integrate migrants, and improve access to work for long-term unemployed and young people. SRPP can promote fair working conditions, equality, skills development, and social inclusion which are central pillars of Ireland’s Presidency goals. It would also promote the European Pillar of Social Rights, demonstrating procurement as a practical tool to improve working conditions, equality, skills, and fair access to economic opportunities. Promoting the use of reserved contracts for social enterprises and inclusive employment models would strengthen the social economy and social enterprise sector, aligning with Ireland’s priorities for community development, inclusive labour markets, and local service delivery. Ireland could spotlight social enterprises as key partners in delivering community services, upskilling and local development. A conference could help build momentum for future EU initiatives on the social economy and implementation of the EU Social Economy Action Plan. Enhance Regional and Rural Development and Support the Green Transition Demonstrating how Socially Responsible Public Procurement can direct investment toward SMEs, rural communities, and underserved regions and promoting approaches that reduce regional inequalities and increase local economic participation would be beneficial. Highlighting procurement as a driver of low-carbon projects, circular economy solutions, and accessible digital services that leave no one behind would support green and digital transitions and would reinforce Ireland’s messaging that fairness and sustainability should go together. Build Member State Capacity and Increase Visibility of the Presidency Sharing best practices and practical tools that help contracting authorities integrate social value consistently across the EU would build Member State capacity and prepare the ground for future EU policy work, feeding into Council conclusions and potential updates to procurement guidance or legislation. A conference would allow Ireland to facilitate knowledge exchange, sharing best-practice and capacity-building for contracting authorities which would strengthen Ireland’s profile as a facilitator of practical, solutions-focused EU cooperation. A conference could also prepare the ground for stronger EU guidance or updated directives on socially responsible procurement and feed into Council conclusions Ireland may wish to steer which could strengthen political commitment among Member States to integrate social criteria consistently. A high-profile conference would demonstrate the Presidency’s focus on fairness, opportunity and community benefit as procurement affects jobs, local development, environmental standards and community services— tangible issues the public understands. It would help to communicate Ireland’s EU priorities in a clear, accessible way to citizens and stakeholders. Hosting such a conference would boost visibility and public engagement in Ireland’s Presidency by focusing on a tangible, easy-to-understand policy area that directly affects communities, businesses, and workers. Overall Added Value A conference on Buy Social and SRPP would support Ireland’s EU Presidency by: Promoting social inclusion through practical economic tools. Strengthening the social economy and local communities. Aligning procurement with green, digital and regional development priorities. Creating EU-wide momentum for fair and responsible public spending. Enhancing Ireland’s leadership and policy influence. In essence, it would turn one of the EU’s biggest spending instruments—public procurement into a powerful driver of social fairness, community benefit and sustainable development, directly reinforcing Ireland’s Presidency goals. Overall, such a conference would position Ireland as a leader in using public funds strategically to deliver fairness, inclusion, and sustainable community impact across the EU."

TBCT supports a people‑centred, performance‑driven approach in which screening participation, stage at diagnosis, time‑to‑treatment, quality of life and return‑to‑work are measured transparently. This aligns with Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan (EBCP). Close inequalities in prevention and early detection of breast cancer: EU data show large gaps in organised screening participation and outcomes. The EU screening scheme’s target of 90% of eligible citizens by 2025 has not been met, and the updated guidelines recommending screening for all women aged 45-74 remains under‑implemented in many Member States. Ireland’s own experience of declining screening number post‑COVID reinforces the need for action. The Presidency should drive implementation of prevention and early detection of breast cancer, focusing on equity and quality assurance and reaching underserved groups. Unlock health data for people and science: Deliver European Health Data Space (EHDS) implementation so patients and professionals have interoperable records and e-prescriptions across borders, while leveraging the secure secondary use of data for research and public health reasons. TBCT asks that the EHDS explicitly supports harmonised breast cancer registries that capture metastatic breast cancer and relapse, which would improve monitoring, close knowledge gaps, and help plan more equitable services. Secure access to innovation and reduce shortages: Time-to-access for oncology therapies remains long and uneven: EU average approx. 578 days from EMA approval to patient access; Ireland approx. 502 days, with lower shares of reimbursed new oncology medicines and biosimilars compared with EU peers. Under Ireland’s Presidency, the Council should conclude the Pharma Package to require supply obligations, enable earlier entry of generics and biosimilars, and strengthen environmental safeguards. At the same time, it should preserve incentives for innovation in unmet‑need areas and reduce patient time‑to‑access across the EU."

From a breast‑cancer perspective, the Presidency should also champion harmonised breast‑cancer registries, to include data on metastatic breast cancer and relapse. Council Recommendation on Cancer Screening: Ireland should drive the implementation of the recommendations on cancer screening and ensure full adoption of the 45-74 breast‑screening age range with appropriate 2-3‑year intervals, complemented by models that raise uptake (e.g mobile breast units). Meanwhile, tailored approaches should address underserved groups and ensure quality assurance and public reporting aligned with European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) guidelines. Pharmaceutical Package: The Presidency should conclude trilogues (if still applicable) on a balanced text that improves access and resilience: make supply obligations enforceable to prevent shortages; enable earlier market entry of generics and biosimilars; and reinforce environmental safeguards. TBCT’s priority is to expand access to biomarker testing (IHC/FISH/NGS, liquid biopsy), workforce training and reimbursement, and to cut time‑to‑access for oncology therapies, so each patient receives the right treatment at the right time. European Beating Cancer Plan (EBCP): TBCT also urges accelerated delivery of EBCP and the Mission on Cancer by expanding the EU Network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres, promoting multidisciplinary staffing, adherence to standards and cross‑border collaboration."

The Presidency should help Member States raise participation in organised screening by scaling approaches are tailored to specifically address local and national challenges and ensure equity of treatment and access across Europe. Patients and clinicians should benefit from the EHDS as soon as possible. Interoperable exchange of patient summaries, imaging, lab results and e‑prescriptions across borders cuts duplicate tests, speeds referrals, and supports continuity of care. The reform of the Pharma Package should translate into shorter time‑to‑access and fewer shortages. Concluding the Pharma Package with enforceable supply obligations, earlier market entry of generics/biosimilars, and clear environmental safeguards will help reduce the current EU average of approx. 578 days from EMA approval to patient access and raise availability and affordability of oncology medicines. For businesses and communities, EHDS standards and simpler performance reporting lower administrative burden and stimulate SME innovation (digital health, AI decision support), while wider availability of biosimilars and community‑based diagnostics reduces travel and cost burdens for families."

The Presidency’s communications should show, in plain language and real stories, how EU health policy improves daily life for people living with breast cancer and their families. For instance, explaining the EHDS as something citizens can use: your records, imaging, lab results and e-prescriptions are accessible and portable when you travel or receive cross-border care (always highlighting the strong privacy and security safeguards). Clinicians benefit too, because data exchange reduces repeat tests and speeds referrals. Screening should also be showcased through practical solutions that raise uptake (e.g. mobile screening units), alongside patient-reported experience feedback that improves logistics and confidence. The aim should be for citizens to see where their country stands and where the gaps need to be closed."

From a Galway Chamber of Commerce perspective, the Presidency priorities closely align with issues of competitiveness, innovation, skills, infrastructure and regional resilience that are central to the future growth of Galway and the wider West of Ireland. A core EU-wide priority in 2026 shoud be competitiveness and economic resilience. For Galway Chamber, this translates into advocating for a stronger Single Market that supports indigenous SMEs, high-growth scaling companies and export-oriented firms. Reducing regulatory complexity, improving access to finance through deeper capital markets, and supporting innovation-led growth are critical for Galway’s diverse enterprise base, including medtech, life sciences, digital technology, creative industries and tourism. The Presidency agenda offers an opportunity to highlight the importance of regional ecosystems in driving European competitiveness. Skills, talent and workforce development will be another key theme. The EU’s focus on the green and digital transitions aligns strongly with Galway Chamber’s priorities around skills pipelines, lifelong learning and industry–education collaboration. Ensuring that EU policy supports reskilling, upskilling and talent retention in regional cities is essential to sustaining growth and addressing labour shortages across sectors. The emphasis on digitalisation and emerging technologies is particularly relevant to Galway’s role as a hub for innovation and R&D. From artificial intelligence and data to advanced manufacturing and health technologies, Galway Chamber supports EU initiatives that enable businesses to adopt new technologies while maintaining proportionate and business-friendly regulation. Digital infrastructure investment, including connectivity and cybersecurity, will be essential enablers for regional competitiveness. Sustainability and climate transition will remain cross-cutting priorities throughout 2026. From a Chamber perspective, the focus must shift towards practical implementation that supports businesses to decarbonise while remaining competitive. This includes access to finance for green investment, support for energy transition projects, and recognition of the role of regional innovation in delivering climate solutions. For Galway, opportunities exist to link sustainability with growth in sectors such as renewables, marine innovation and sustainable tourism. EU enlargement and geopolitical stability also matter for Galway businesses. A stable and secure Europe underpins trade, investment and supply chain resilience. Galway Chamber supports a merit-based enlargement process and strong EU external relations, recognising their importance for export markets and international collaboration. Finally, the EU Presidency will advance discussions on EU funding, governance and cohesion. From a regional perspective, it is vital that EU programmes continue to support balanced regional development, infrastructure investment and innovation outside capital cities. Galway Chamber will advocate for policies that recognise the contribution of regional cities as engines of national and European growth. In summary, the EU Presidency priorities in 2026 closely align with Galway Chamber’s strategic focus on competitiveness, skills, innovation and sustainable regional development. The Presidency provides a platform to ensure that EU policy reflects the needs and potential of regions like Galway, enabling businesses to thrive in a more competitive, resilient and inclusive Europe."
376,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d63712f6/Galway_Chamber_-_Submission_376.docx,Galway Chamber,Membership Business CLG,Business,Galway City and County,2,"A primary policy focus should be competitiveness and the functioning of the Single Market. Legislative attention should be directed towards simplification measures, regulatory burden reduction and the removal of barriers to cross-border activity, particularly for SMEs and scaling enterprises. Progress on initiatives linked to the Capital Markets Union and access to finance will be critical. The Presidency should aim to deliver tangible improvements in the business environment, ensuring that EU regulation supports entrepreneurship, innovation and regional enterprise, rather than adding complexity. Innovation, digitalisation and emerging technologies should form a second core pillar. While much of the EU’s digital regulatory framework is now in place, the legislative focus in 2026 should shift towards implementation, clarification and proportionality. This includes ensuring that digital, data and AI-related legislation enables adoption and scaling by businesses of all sizes. The Presidency should aim to strike a balance between safeguarding citizens and fostering innovation, providing certainty for firms investing in research, development and advanced technologies across regional innovation ecosystems. A third priority area is skills, labour markets and the social dimension. Legislative and policy initiatives should focus on workforce adaptability, skills development and talent mobility, particularly in the context of the green and digital transitions. The Presidency should support measures that strengthen lifelong learning, reskilling and upskilling, while improving alignment between education systems and labour market needs. The objective should be to ensure that businesses across Europe, including in regional economies, can access the skills required to grow and remain competitive. Sustainability, climate action and the energy transition will remain central themes. Rather than introducing significant new regulatory frameworks, the Presidency should prioritise the effective implementation of existing Green Deal legislation. Legislative focus should be on coherence, investment frameworks and practical supports that enable businesses to decarbonise without undermining competitiveness. The Presidency should aim to ensure that climate policy is economically realistic, innovation-led and supportive of regional development. Migration and demographic resilience should also feature prominently. Legislative efforts should concentrate on the implementation of the EU Migration and Asylum Pact alongside broader discussions on legal migration and labour mobility. The Presidency should aim to promote a more strategic, economically informed approach to migration, recognising its role in addressing labour shortages and supporting growth. Finally, EU funding, cohesion and governance will be an important cross-cutting area. The Presidency should work to ensure that EU financial instruments and budgetary discussions support balanced regional development, infrastructure investment and innovation capacity. The overarching aim should be to reinforce the role of regions and regional cities as key contributors to Europe’s economic and social resilience. In summary, the 2026 EU Presidency should focus on delivering a more competitive, innovative and resilient Europe, with policy and legislative progress that is practical, inclusive and supportive of regional business communities."

To make the most substantial positive impact, the Council’s work should be guided by a strong focus on delivery, inclusion and long-term resilience, ensuring that EU policy translates into real-world outcomes. A first priority should be turning policy into practice. Much of the EU’s legislative framework in areas such as digital regulation, climate action and migration is already agreed. The Irish Presidency can make a meaningful difference by focusing the Council’s work on effective, consistent and business-friendly implementation. By prioritising clarity, proportionality and coherence in Council negotiations, Ireland can help ensure that EU legislation delivers certainty for businesses and practical benefits for citizens, rather than unnecessary complexity. Competitiveness and quality employment should be central to the Council’s agenda. The Presidency can drive progress on strengthening the Single Market, reducing administrative burdens and improving access to finance for SMEs and scaling companies. This will directly benefit businesses while supporting job creation and regional economic vitality. A strong focus on competitiveness is also essential to sustaining Europe’s social model, as thriving enterprises underpin investment in public services and community development. For people and communities, the Council’s work should prioritise skills, inclusion and opportunity. Ireland’s Presidency can champion Council initiatives that support reskilling, lifelong learning and labour market participation, ensuring that the green and digital transitions are inclusive and fair. By promoting policies that align education and training systems with labour market needs, the Council can help individuals adapt to change and access quality employment, particularly in regions facing demographic or structural challenges. Regional balance and cohesion should be a defining feature of Ireland’s approach. The Council plays a key role in shaping EU funding, governance and policy direction. Ireland can use the Presidency to ensure that regional voices are reflected in Council discussions and that EU programmes continue to support infrastructure, innovation and services in regional and rural areas. This will help strengthen trust in the European project by ensuring that growth and opportunity are widely shared. The Presidency can also make a positive impact by promoting a pragmatic approach to sustainability and climate action. Through the Council, Ireland can help ensure that climate policies are implemented in a way that supports communities and businesses, balancing ambition with economic and social realities. Emphasising investment, innovation and local solutions will help communities transition sustainably while maintaining competitiveness. Finally, the Irish Presidency can add value by fostering a culture of consensus and constructive dialogue within the Council. Ireland’s reputation as an honest broker positions it well to bridge differing perspectives among Member States. By encouraging collaboration and compromise, the Council’s work can progress more effectively, delivering outcomes that benefit citizens and businesses across Europe. In essence, the greatest impact of the Council’s work during Ireland’s Presidency will come from focusing on implementation, competitiveness, inclusion and regional cohesion ensuring that EU policy improves everyday life for people, strengthens businesses and supports resilient, thriving communities across the Union."
376,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d63712f6/Galway_Chamber_-_Submission_376.docx,Galway Chamber,Membership Business CLG,Business,Galway City and County,4,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union offers more than a diplomatic role; it presents a rare opportunity to reconnect Europe with its citizens and to strengthen a shared sense of ownership in the European project. At a time when trust in institutions is fragile and global uncertainty is growing, how we communicate the values and benefits of EU membership matters as much as the policies we advance. The starting point must be a simple but powerful shift in perspective: the European Union is not something that happens to people, but something they actively shape. For Ireland, EU membership has always been rooted in values that resonate deeply with our national identity solidarity, fairness, opportunity and cooperation. From peace-building and regional development to workers’ rights, research innovation and climate action, the EU has been a quiet but constant partner in Ireland’s social and economic progress. However, benefits that feel distant or abstract risk being taken for granted. During the Presidency, communication should focus on making Europe visible in everyday life. This means telling local stories how EU investment has supported broadband in rural communities, research in universities, small businesses exporting for the first time, or young people studying and working across borders. When citizens can see the European Union reflected in their own town, workplace or family experience, the EU becomes real and relevant. Equally important is moving beyond one-way communication towards genuine participation. A sense of ownership grows when people feel heard. Ireland’s Presidency should create space for citizen dialogue that is inclusive and accessible, engaging young people, rural communities, workers, entrepreneurs and civic groups. Crucially, these conversations must close the loop, showing how citizen perspectives inform priorities and decision-making at European level. Participation without feedback risks deepening cynicism rather than trust. Trusted messengers also matter. People are more likely to engage with stories told by peers than by institutions. Farmers, researchers, apprentices, artists, sports clubs and community leaders can all act as authentic voices of Europe, sharing how EU membership supports their ambitions and values. By equipping these networks with simple tools and narratives, Ireland can amplify a diverse and human picture of Europe. Ireland’s strengths in culture, creativity and sport offer further opportunities to connect emotionally with citizens. Cultural expression and shared sporting experiences transcend politics and speak directly to values of inclusion, respect and cooperation. Embedding these elements into the Presidency programme can help communicate Europe not just as a political entity, but as a shared social and cultural space. Finally, honesty is essential. Communicating the value of EU membership does not mean ignoring challenges or trade-offs. Acknowledging concerns whether around cost of living, climate transition or migration while explaining how Ireland advocates for fairness within Europe builds credibility and trust.

In particular the aim of improving cross-border provision of funds and reducing operational barriers facing asset managers is key to realizing the aims of SIU. The recently announced Market Integration Plan, to address market fragmentation, has much to recommend it[3] to help increase scale and efficiency (notwithstanding regulatory change brings operational challenges and costs). Implementing the key measures in a timely deliberate and effective way, led by the Irish presidency liaising with the co-legislators, other member states and stakeholders, will be important so the improvements are not delayed or watered down. (IAIM would observe at this point that proposals ESMA supervisory overlay for large cross-border managers, if it progresses, should be proportionate and not affect the clarity or finality of national regulators' decisions and approvals.

In addition, a Eurobarometer survey in 2023 showed that a large majority of Europeans (84%) believe that the welfare of farmed animals should be better protected in their country than it is now. A similar number (83%) support limiting the transport time of animals. Therefore, it is clear that EU citizens do indeed want better protections for animals. For the Council to ignore their wishes is an affront to democracy and the Treaty of Lisbon. In light of the above, it is imperative that the Council acts in accordance with the wishes of its citizens with respect to animal welfare, and that it progresses animal welfare proposals in a meaningful way. By attempting to water down or prevent new animal welfare proposals, and continuously pushing back on promises made in this regard, this does not show that the EU has value, quite the opposite. Each member of the Council should also be made aware of the importance of enforcing existing animal welfare legislation. The poor level of enforcement that currently exists and which allows serious animal welfare breaches to occur on a massive scale does not instill confidence in EU citizens. We would also suggest that an animal welfare conference is organised during the Irish Presidency which discusses the progress of new animal welfare proposals and sets out how they will improve animal welfare when enacted (and properly enforced).

For communities: safer, well-designed lighting solutions; enhanced public spaces; reduced municipal energy costs; and stronger engagement with environmental protection. For businesses: best practice European guidance on sustainable lighting; development opportunities for lighting and design industries in the EU; and innovation in satellite-friendly, astronomy-compatible technologies. For biodiversity and ecosystems: improved conditions for pollinators, migratory species, and nocturnal wildlife, supporting implementation of the Nature Restoration Regulation. These benefits reflect EU-wide priorities under the European Green Deal, Zero Pollution ambition, Biodiversity Strategy, and energy-efficiency objectives.

In particular, we propose the following priorities: 1. Early learning as a driver of sustainable economic prosperity and competitiveness Investing in accessible, high-quality early learning lays strong foundations for lifelong learning, boosting human capital from the earliest years. We recommend championing an EU-wide roadmap that supports affordable, high-quality services. Ensuring that more families have access to reliable early learning and care not only supports parents’ labour market participation (especially women), but helps build a more skilled, adaptable future workforce. This can contribute directly to the competitiveness and long-term economic resilience of the EU. Early education and childcare as part of quality of life and social fairness Under Ireland’s Presidency, we recommend that policies be explicitly integrated into the work programme under these social priorities. By doing so, the EU can promote equality of opportunity from the start of life - offering children from all socio-economic, ethnic and migrant backgrounds access to quality early learning. This helps reduce inequalities from the earliest stages and strengthens social cohesion across Member States. Early learning as a tool for peacebuilding, inclusion, and democratic values Under the strategic ambition of “a free and democratic Europe,” early childhood services can play a subtle but powerful role in building shared European identity, social inclusion, and intergenerational solidarity. Ireland’s Presidency could, for instance, promote cross-national exchange and cooperation on curricula that foster mutual respect, democratic values, inclusion of minorities and migrants, helping prevent marginalisation and social fragmentation. High-quality early learning and care can be a stabilising force in communities, particularly states facing economic or demographic pressures, and can contribute over time to peaceful, cohesive societies. A European ‘Early Years Pact’ embedding early learning and care in long-term EU policy frameworks We propose that Ireland use its 2026 Presidency as a catalyst for agreement among Member States around an ‘Early Years Pact’. This would commit the EU to measurable targets: universal or nearuniversal access to quality early learning, staff training and professionalisation, funding mechanisms, inclusivity and equity, and monitoring/quality assurance systems. Leveraging early learning and care to support demographic and social changes across the EU. Many EU states face demographic shifts, ageing populations, gender labour-market gaps, and growing inequality. High-quality early learning services help address these challenges by supporting childhood development, enabling workforce participation, and promoting gender equality. Under Ireland’s Presidency, a renewed focus on early education and childcare could be positioned as key to tackling demographic, social, and economic challenges, consistent with the Commission’s ambition for sustainable prosperity and social fairness."

Embedding early learning and childcare under “Prosperous and Competitive Europe” Under this umbrella, the Irish Presidency should: Advocate for a European-level framework or strategy to support universal access to affordable, high-quality early learning and care across Member States. Such a framework could help to unlock full workforce participation, especially among women, thereby boosting labour supply and economic productivity. Encourage recognition and support for early education and childcare as a foundational investment in human capital - equipping future generations with skills, social and cognitive development, and long-term societal benefit. Promote policies that integrate early learning and care funding and support mechanisms into EU recovery and cohesion funds, making early learning part of broader social investment rather than a national afterthought. Advancing “European Social Fairness” and “Quality of Life / Social Cohesion” The Irish Presidency could champion: Legislation or non-legislative EU guidance setting minimum standards for staff qualification, educator-child ratios, inclusivity, and quality assurance in early learning and childcare to ensure that early learning is not just available, but of genuinely high standard. Initiatives targeting equal access for children from disadvantaged, migrant, or minority backgrounds, ensuring early learning and care contributes to reducing inequality from the earliest stages of life. Cross-national cooperation and exchange of best practices for early learning and care, enabling smaller or under-resourced Member States to build capacity and benefit from shared learning and EU support. A Means of Social Cohesion, Inclusion, and Peacebuilding - contributing to “A free and democratic Europe” Under its Presidency, Ireland should: Encourage embedding values of inclusion, tolerance, diversity, and democratic citizenship into early learning curricula across the EU. High-quality early learning and care can nurture respect for human rights, mutual understanding, and long-term social cohesion - contributing to peacebuilding and stable communities across the Union. Use the Presidency to launch or support an EU-wide “Early Years for Inclusion and Cohesion” initiative - encouraging Member States to adopt early learning policies that foster social integration, reduce marginalisation, and build shared civic values from early childhood onwards. What Ireland Should Aim to Achieve by End of 2026 By the close of its Presidency, we would like to see Ireland deliver: A clear, strategic European commitment to early learning - e.g., a Council Conclusions document endorsing early education and childcare as a priority for social investment, economic growth, and social cohesion. Agreement among Member States on minimum quality standards and equity of access for services. Commitment to mobilising EU funding (e.g., through cohesion, social, recovery or structural funds) to support expansion, workforce professionalisation, and inclusion - especially in underserved regions or communities. An EU-wide network or platform for sharing best practices, data, and monitoring outcomes - to promote continuous improvement and ensure accountability. Recognition of early learning and care as a cross-cutting policy: contributing not only to education or social policy, but to labour market participation, gender equality, demographic resilience, integration, and long-term social stability. We stand ready to provide detailed proposals, data, and partnership to support these ambitions."

Driving competitiveness and productivity through early years investment Ireland’s Presidency can make a concrete difference for businesses by treating early learning and care as essential economic infrastructure: Prioritise full implementation and strengthening of the EU Early Childhood Education and Care ‘Barcelona’ targets. Children Aged 3 to Primary School: At least 96% participation. Children Under 3: At least 45% participation Duration: Services ideally accessed for at least 25 hours per week. Frame early learning and care expansion as a labour-market and productivity measure, supporting parental employment, entrepreneurship and skills, not just a “social” cost. EUSocialCit Promote the use of EU funds for childcare infrastructure, workforce development and innovation in early learning, particularly in underserved rural and cross-border regions. This approach supports SMEs and local economies by improving workforce availability, reducing absenteeism and fostering a more skilled future workforce. Advancing social fairness and quality of life via the European Child Guarantee We recommend that Ireland: Makes implementation of the European Child Guarantee a flagship Council priority, emphasising free and effective access to quality early education and childcare as a core service for children in need. Encourages Member States, via Council debates and conclusions, to use Child Guarantee National Action Plans to reduce child poverty, address regional inequalities in early learning, and embed minimum quality standards (staff qualifications, ratios, inclusion, child-centred pedagogy). Alliance for Investing in Children+1 Champion “child-rights budgeting” so that fiscal and structural reforms under EU economic governance are assessed for their impact. UNICEF Strengthening democracy, cohesion and peacebuilding from the earliest years Ireland’s Presidency could: Lead Council discussions and conclusions highlighting the role of early learning in social cohesion and peacebuilding, especially in communities marked by conflict legacy, polarisation, migration pressures or socio-economic divides. Promote EU-level support for early years curricula and educator training that explicitly foster empathy, non-discrimination, gender equality, conflict resolution and respect for diversity. First Years First Priority+1 Encourage cooperation on cross-border early years projects and exchanges, particularly in border regions or areas with a history of tension, showcasing how shared services for young children and families can build trust and shared identity over time. What the Irish Presidency should aim to deliver 1. Strong Council Conclusions that: o reaffirm early learning and care as a strategic priority cutting across competitiveness, social fairness and democracy; o call for ambitious implementation of the European Care Strategy, Barcelona targets and Child Guarantee. A concrete “Early Years implementation track” within ensuring that early childhood is reflected in economic, social and territorial cohesion debates. A political signal that investing in quality early learning is one of the EU’s most effective tools for: o boosting productivity and innovation; o reducing poverty and inequality; o building inclusive, peaceful and democratic societies.

Tell a simple story: “The EU in your child’s early years” The Presidency could use early learning and childcare as a storytelling lens for EU membership: Highlight how initiatives such as the European Child Guarantee, cohesion policy and the European Pillar of Social Rights support access to quality early childhood education and care, especially for disadvantaged children. Show that early learning and care is not just a social good but a driver of prosperity and competitiveness: enabling parents to work or train, supporting local businesses and developing the future skilled workforce. Campaigns, short videos and local case studies from early years settings across Ireland and the wider EU can humanise EU policy: “This is how Europe is investing in your child, your job, your community.” Use early years spaces as democratic and social hubs Early years settings could become front-line communication hubs: Support preschools, crèches and community early years centres to host “EU in the Early Years” weeks – simple activities, displays and conversations with parents about how EU funding and cooperation benefit local services. Provide accessible materials in multiple languages explaining EU values of solidarity, social fairness and equal opportunities, and how these underpin investment in early learning. Involve early years practitioners as trusted community messengers, equipped with clear, nontechnical information on EU policies affecting families (child poverty, parental leave, work–life balance, inclusion). Highlight peacebuilding, inclusion and democracy from the earliest years Protecting democracy and upholding our values – could be communicated through the lived experience of young children learning to live well together: Showcase cross-border and cross-community early years projects on the island of Ireland as practical examples of EU-supported peacebuilding, demonstrating how shared provision for young children builds trust, reduces prejudice and strengthens long-term social cohesion. Promote early years curricula that nurture empathy, respect for diversity, conflict resolution and participation, and communicate these as the roots of democratic culture and European values. Ensure that Presidency communication materials emphasise children’s rights and participation, aligning with EU child-rights and fundamental rights frameworks. 4. Co-create the Presidency with citizens, families and children To build ownership over Ireland’s Presidency: Involve parents, early years educators and young children in designing logos, stories or local events linked to the Presidency. Fund small community projects in early years and family centres that explore “Our lives in the EU,” feeding their outputs into Presidency exhibitions and digital platforms. Communicate in plain language, via local media and community networks, how Presidency decisions connect back to these everyday realities. By putting quality early learning services at the centre of the story of EU membership, Ireland can communicate that the EU is about the wellbeing, opportunities and peaceful future of every child, family and community across Europe."

The importance of early learning and care & school-age childcare and the vital role it plays in the economy and society was evident during the Covid pandemic. Throughout the pandemic providers ensured continuity of care and education to children, supported parents, played a special role in caring for the children of essential workers, and enabled the economy to reopen at a time of unprecedented crisis. Global research shows that learning starts in infancy and in the early years, and this is the optimal stage where basic abilities can be altered. The most economically efficient time to develop these skills and abilities is in the very early years (0-5) when developmental education is most effective. Additionally, ability gaps between the advantaged and disadvantaged open up early in the life of the child. If society intervenes early enough, it can affect cognitive and socio-emotional abilities and the health of disadvantaged children. Early interventions have much higher returns than other later interventions such as reduced pupil-teacher ratios, public job training, convict rehabilitation programmes, tuition subsidies or expenditure on police. Countries that invest well in early learning and care recognise improvement in: The economy: both short-term, by facilitating labour, in particular of working women (mothers and grandmothers), and long-term through the upskilling of the future workforce Mental and physical health for children and families, including less at-risk behaviours Social welfare and criminal justice, less family violence and social crime Educational achievement, including better outcomes of young children at-risk Earlier identification of and support for special educational needs and disabilities."

106,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4eab2d0/Skillnet_Ireland_-_Submission_106.docx,Skillnet Ireland,National Organisation,Business Support,,1,"The criticality of Skills for a competitive European economy: The September 2024 publication of Mario Draghi’s report on European Competitiveness has raised existential questions around the future of the European economy and business competitiveness which will continue to dominate policy debates when Ireland assumes the rotating EU Presidency in 2026. Among Draghi’s recommendations is the need for a fundamental rethink of the EU’s approach to upskilling and skills policy. Draghi argues that EU competitiveness and the success of the EU’s social model requires a labour force endowed with the correct knowledge and skills, and that skills are the foundation of a thriving and competitive economy. The availability of a highly skilled workforce is fundamental to Ireland’s and Europe’s shared competitiveness and the achievement of the green and digital transitions. At present the EU is experiencing a skills shortage in strategic sectors which is hampering businesses’ ability to compete at the global level and the Draghi report highlighted that 54% of European businesses consider skills shortages to be among their most pressing challenges. The launch of the Union of Skills within the first 100 days of the new European Commission term by Commissioner Minzatu, alongside the formation of a dedicated Intergroup on Skills policy in the European Parliament, demonstrates the growing importance of Skills on the EU policy agenda. Access to a highly skilled workforce is a long-standing feature of Ireland’s economic success. Over decades, Ireland has demonstrated how sustained investment in education and workforce development can serve as the foundation of national prosperity and driving force behind FDI. Across Europe, businesses face growing difficulty accessing the skills they need to scale, innovate, and compete globally. Key sectors include AI and digital technologies and green and renewable energy industries. These shortages constrain productivity, delay critical infrastructure and climate projects, weaken innovation performance, and reduce Europe’s strategic autonomy. The Irish Presidency can play a transformative role by placing access to skills at the core of the EU’s competitiveness agenda. Ireland is unique among EU member states in having the dedicated workforce development agency, Skillnet Ireland, which focusses on boosting economic competitiveness through upskilling, with over 25 years' experience. In 2024, Skillnet Ireland was accredited as ‘International Best Practice’ across upskilling agencies from 47 countries by the European Commission as part of the ‘Pact for Skills’ initiative for the organisation’s impact on boosting economic performance through upskilling and its impact on the individual learner and green and digital transitions. Throughout the EU Presidency term, Ireland can draw on our country’s leading reputation in forging higher education partnerships between industry and academia to develop flexible learning pathways, with a view to shaping a European approach to upskilling that is accessible to learners and aligned with the needs of business. For Ireland, ensuring continued access to a skilled, adaptable workforce is central to maintaining its economic prosperity, increasing productivity levels in existing industries, and maintaining growth into the future. Championing a skills-driven competitiveness agenda, Ireland can help steer the EU toward a stronger, more dynamic, and more resilient economic future, while reinforcing one of Ireland’s enduring strategic advantages."
106,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4eab2d0/Skillnet_Ireland_-_Submission_106.docx,Skillnet Ireland,National Organisation,Business Support,,2,"A central priority for the Irish Presidency of the Council in 2026 should be to secure an ambitious outcome in the negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), with a clear and protected allocation for skills policy. Skills are the backbone of Europe’s competitiveness, resilience, and social cohesion. Ensuring that the next MFF provides stable, predictable, and ring-fenced funding for skills is essential not only for Ireland but for the long-term strategic capacity of the European Union. Why skills must be ring-fenced in the next MFF: As Europe works to meet the challenges of the green and digital transitions that require unprecedented investment in the European workforce, access to employees with the necessary skills remains one of the most pressing challenges facing European businesses according to the Draghi report. Concerningly, Europe’s skills shortage is most pressing in critical sectors such as renewable energy, construction, AI and digital technologies, cybersecurity, health, and advanced manufacturing. The upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework will set Europe’s path to meeting these challenges over the coming years and without necessary funding, member states will struggle to deliver the workforce development initiatives at the necessary scale. Ring-fencing funding for upskilling within the MFF will ensure programmes such as the European Social Fund+, Erasmus+, the Just Transition Fund, and digital skills initiatives have the financial capacity to deliver real impact. For Ireland, where economic success has long depended on a strong and adaptable talent base and constant access to upskilling opportunities, securing this outcome is fundamental to preserving the country’s competitiveness and continued attractiveness to investment. As part of the MFF agenda, the Irish Presidency should focus on advancing files that underpin Europe’s talent pipeline, including the strengthening of ESF+ as the primary EU instrument for skills and employment. The overarching objective should be to secure a robust MFF that secures protected funding to skills policy, ensuring that long-term EU policy priorities translate into meaningful national action. Specifically, the Irish Presidency should aim to: Guarantee ring-fenced funding for skills within ESF+ and other relevant programmes. Ensure that skills funding is flexible enough to respond to labour market needs. Prioritise funding mechanisms that support upskilling in SMEs and regional development particularly those which incorporate industry need in order to maximise their relevance to European businesses. • Embed skills as a cross-cutting requirement in all major EU funding programmes from cohesion to climate action to digitalisation. By championing protected investment in skills, Ireland can shape an MFF that strengthens Europe’s competitiveness, supports sustainable growth, and ensures all access to upskilling across the EU over the coming years."

The agri-food sector generates about 8-10/ of Ireland’s GDP. Ireland needs to transition away from beef and dairy production to a veganic (organic plant based) agricultural system. Ireland needs to set up a start up fund for Plant Based Companies and create a EU Plant Based Action Plan. Food security and Food System Productivity is a second critical Priority. While Ireland exported about €19 billion in agri-food products we also imported about €13.5 billion. Irish tillage farmers produce 30 times the food calories of its beef farmers, which is an incredibly inefficient way to produce protein. Ireland and the EU need to transition to plant proteins and away from animal derived protein sources. Ecosystem Restoration – Ireland has one of the lowest Biodiversity Intactness Index in the world. Many species continue to go extinct and the two biggest impacts are farming and fisheries. Ireland should return 40% of the current agricultural land area back to bogs, wetlands and forest. Ireland and the EU have committeed to 30% of land and marine area being fully protected. This is a critical area of focus. Protein Diversification The development of an EU Plant-Based Action Plan was also included in the program of the Danish Presidency of the Council.

This is the main goal of the VSI as enshrined in its constitution. EU Plant-Based Action Plan Billions of animals are imprisoned and slaughtered in the EU Agricultural and Fisheries sectors. A shift to healthier, more sustainable, affordable and whole food plant based dietary pattern is essential for a successful transition to a more sustainable food system. In this sense, the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of Agriculture expressly recommended the EU Commission (EC) to “develop, by 2026, an EU Action Plan for Plant-based Foods to strengthen the plant-based agri-food chains from farmers all the way to consumers”. For more information on this topic, you can find the EU Policy Blueprint here. This was endorsed by 130+ organisations representing farmers, consumers, health, animal welfare and environmental interests Common Agriculture Policy and Common Market Organisation Regulation The discussions on the next Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and revision of the Common Market Organisation(CMO) will take form during the Irish Presidency. This presents key opportunities to influence the agri-food sector at the EU level, and support EU Farmers, Producers and Consumers. Under the next CAP framework, we strongly call on the upcoming Presidency to hold discussions on the topics of protein diversification and creating opportunities for farmers producing, or looking to produce plant-based foods. We see some potential in the following proposals by the European Commission: Diversification support under agri-environmental and climate actions; Transition help under agri-environmental and climate actions; Capping of direct payments and redistribution with a focus on smaller holdings and more sustainable farming models; Investment support focusing on contribution to the overall resilience of European agriculture; New support schemes for young farmers, including a starter-pack; The creation of a mandatory protein sector under the Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation (recognition of producer organisation, access to sectoral interventions, marketing standards, promotion policy) Public Procurement Public procurement policies, accounting for 15% of the EU GDP, can play a central role in leveraging public money to shape a more sustainable EU food system. Overall, we strongly believe that by prioritising plant-based options in public procurement (PP) policies, demand will be driven towards more sustainable food products, thereby supporting EU farmers and fostering innovation in sustainable agriculture. This approach would also benefit public health, food security, farmers’ competitiveness, and the environment. EU School Scheme We would call for the phasing out of providing dairy in the EU school scheme. As a first step we call for widening the scope of eligible products under the school scheme, by including unsweetened and fortified plant-based milk alternatives. Plant based milks cater to those who cannot or choose not to consume cow's milk for medical, ethical, environmental, or taste reasons. Unsweetened and fortified plant-based milk alternatives can be a healthy part of a nutritionally varied and well-planned diet, serving as a great nutritious alternative to cow’s milk."

The existing legislative framework is clear in its objectives. For example, the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) is a cornerstone of the EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan, designed to accelerate the clean energy transition and strengthen Europe’s industrial base for net-zero technologies. This, along with other legislation, such as the Renewable Energy Directive, and the European Grids Package, will aim to remove bottlenecks, bolster energy security, enhance competitiveness and advance the EU’s clean technology capabilities. The timely agreement of the MFF will be key to unlocking opportunities. The two major energy files/packages likely to feature during Ireland's Presidency are of critical importance for several reasons. With respect to the European Grids Package, grids are critical to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The investment is crucial given that electricity demand is projected to increase by 60% by 2030. The revised EU Energy Security Framework aims to strengthen the resilience and adaptability of Europe’s energy system considering new geopolitical, technological, and climate realities. It will be key to enabling the energy transition: decarbonisation and electrification increase system complexity and interdependence, requiring more robust integration of renewables, grid development, and energy storage.

The Lancet Countdown Report 2025 states that “the health threats of climate change have reached concerning, unprecedented levels”, with delays in climate action resulting in millions of excess deaths every year (3). Climate change has been unequivocally linked to the use of fossil fuels (4), yet the fossil fuel industry continues to thrive. As well as record temperatures, 2024 saw record levels of gas emissions. At the current rate of production of fossil fuels, the world is headed for a catastrophic 2.7°C temperature rise by the end of this century. Despite decades of science-based warnings, fossil fuel production is not slowing down, to the contrary, it’s speeding up. In response to the energy crisis precipitated by Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine in 2022, governments have funneled tax-payer’s money into subsidies to keep energy affordable, amounting in some cases, to more than the entire health budget (3). In 2023, Ireland paid €4.9 billion in fossil fuel subsidies (5), coming close to the Health Service Executive’s spend on the pay and pensions of its entire clinical staff (€5.4bn) (6). Ironically, we support practices harming human health almost as much as those who work to benefit it. The energy crisis also led to a backslide of climate commitments, with some EU countries restarting the exploration of fossil fuels to reduce reliance on imported liquefied natural gas. Last month, Greece issued its first offshore oil and gas exploration license to a consortium of fossil fuel companies, paving the way to the exploitation of an estimated 200 billion cubic metres of natural gas in the Ionian Sea. Italy is also considering renewing offshore oil and gas exploration, as is Poland, following the discovery of a major offshore oil field (7). Meanwhile, the COP 30 summit could be seen as a coup for fossil fuel companies and their beneficiaries, who successfully lobbied for an agreement that failed to mention a phase-out of fossil fuels at all (8). Europe’s historic legacy of colonialism has led to deep divides that persist in modern society (9). The people of the global south suffer disproportionately from climate change, despite having contributed the least to the problem (10). With the current US administration endorsing climate denialism and withdrawing from the Paris agreement, it falls to the EU to stand in solidarity with those at the frontline of climate change, reverse the current backslide, reinvigorate commitments to climate action, and end our reliance on the consumption of fossil fuels. The injustices of the past cannot be allowed to prevail again. The world is at a crossroads, and the actions taken now will impact future generations for centuries to come."

This would release billions of euro which could be reinvested in renewable energy and sustainable public transport systems, ending our reliance on fossil fuels. While a short-term increase in fuel prices is inevitable, this may be offset by financially supporting communities in a transition to safe and renewable energy sources. Eliminating EU country’s reliance on fossil fuels and empowering countries to develop domestic renewable energy sources will enhance energy security for Europe during this and future times of instability. Renewable energy sources are about 50% cheaper than fossil fuels – so short-term costs can be offset by longer-term savings (11). The funds to support the transition are already available too – stimulus packages released by the worlds’ governments in response to the COVID pandemic amounted to 10 times what would be needed to achieve net zero emissions for the entire world by 2050 (12). Ban the exploration and production of fossil fuels. An immediate ban on the exploration of fossil fuels is imperative if we are to halt climate change, mitigate the damage already done and prevent the impending climate disaster predicted to occur by the end of this century, within the lifespans of our children and our children’s children. The first climate tipping point of no return – widespread diebacks of warm water coral reefs – has already been reached. Other tipping points – ice melt, the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, and the circulation of vital ocean currents – will follow. The collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC) could plunge north-west Europe into an ice-age, with a catastrophic impact on millions of lives (13). We already have everything we need to achieve this. Renewable energy sources are all around us, and there is more than enough potential to meet the world’s energy needs (11). There are also ample raw materials to support the transition to clean, renewable energy and while the extraction of materials will have its own environmental impact, it will still be a fraction of the damage being caused by burning fossil fuels (15). We are not lacking the technology or resources to transition to safe, renewable energy; what we are lacking are the political structures that could prevent bad actors from exploiting the planet and jeopardizing all our futures. What is needed is bravery, vision, and commitment. Ireland, a small country with a big voice, has an opportunity to step up and meet the defining health challenge of the 21st century, as recognized by the WHO (15). The time to act is now: in the words of former Uachtarán na hÉireann, Mary Robinson, “Climate change is a fundamental problem that we must solve and not merely pass on to the generations to come… We can’t let our children and our grandchildren look back on this critical period and say that we failed them”."

Communicating the necessity in the interest in public health to shift away from fossil fuels, coupled with a transparent redirection of released funds into greener measures will not only positively impact health, but ensure awareness of said impact. Transparency and communication surrounding funds released by ending fossil fuel subsidies, and their redirection into green initiatives (supporting public and active transport schemes, renewable energy projects) ensures public buy-in and facilitates a just transition towards a sustainable lifestyle fostered by EU presidency. Certain initiatives could be implemented to fully engage communities in a just transition away from fossil fuels. These could include increasing urban green space in cities and investing in the 15-minute walkable city, which improves social, mental and physical wellbeing, in addition to economic benefits from the resulting increased commerce. This would also reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in cities, resulting in shorter commutes and cleaner air for all. Retrofitting schemes for existing housing would also assist in preventing fuel poverty from rising fuel prices. Including marginalized groups in decision-making will be key to optimizing positive impact. Low-income and migrant demographics, the elderly, are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and are most often overlooked when transition policy and measures (e.g. carbon taxes) are implemented."

Ireland should ensure that this is firmly on the Agenda of the Presidency, that the proposed budget is preserved and ensure 90% is devoted to ODA, reinstating minimum spending targets for fragile and conflict affected states and LDCs, counter proposals on aid conditionality and balance flexibility with predictability for partner countries. We should focus on ensuring an explicit reference to poverty reduction, and setting clear targets for human development, gender equality, climate and biodiversity and civil society. Policy coherence for sustainable development is critical. Ireland should specifically focus on the following: ● In regards to Climate action, the Irish Presidency should focus on: The post-2030 climate framework, ensuring that adaptation financing, gender action plan and just transition principles are embedded in EU law. Strengthening the EU’s Leadership by influencing Climate Finance Contributions - quality and quantity: Ireland is recognised by Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States as a trusted partner in climate finance negotiations and has built a strong reputation through its principled, grant-based climate finance support. To maintain influence within the climate negotiations and impact through climate action, Ireland could leverage its role in COP31 to influence the EUs approach to international climate finance contributions, while maintaining a focus on adaptation and loss and damage financing. Prioritise the external aspects of the European integrated framework for climate resilience, to support a just transition globally and highlight the inclusivity, intersectionality and interconnectedness of climate action. - With COP31 taking place during Ireland’s Presidency, work towards a substantive outcome to the SSJWA whose current 4 year mandate ends at COP31. An outcome which firstly recognises the imperative of addressing the agriculture climate finance gap and supports accessible grantbased actions for resilient and equitably transformative agriculture and food systems and secondly includes a formal decision for the continuance of work on climate action on agriculture and food security post COP31. Work closely with the Commission on the substantive implementation of the EU Civil Society Strategy in European member states, across EU institutions and in EU’s external action, including in the Global Gateway Strategy, which is critical to countering the shrinking of civil society space globally. The EU has the opportunity to respond positively to global trends by showcasing the value of a thriving, vibrant and well-resourced civic space. Ensuring the active participation of autonomous civil society in the design, implementation and monitoring of EU's strategy, including the Civil Society Platform and online knowledge hub, would set an important precedent in this regard. Prioritise Nutrition: A recent European Court of Auditor’s special report on the Commission’s support to fight hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa notes that the shift in focus from structural and persistent malnutrition to supporting value chains risks sidelining chronic nutrition crises, as nutrition is losing prominence on the EU agenda. This trend is reinforced by the Global Gateway initiative, which prioritises other sectors and does not directly address food insecurity or malnutrition. Ireland should use its presidency to put nutrition high on the EU’s political agenda. Integrating nutrition across relevant Council agendas would help reverse declining global attention and reaffirm nutrition as a foundation for sustainable development and stability. Existing EU frameworks, such as the Action Plan on Nutrition (2015–2025) and the Guidelines on Addressing Undernutrition in Emergencies, are now outdated and poorly aligned with newer EU priorities. Ireland can play a pivotal role by inviting the Commission to update its food security and nutrition policy frameworks. A renewed EU Nutrition Policy Framework is urgently needed, particularly in light of the recent reduction in U.S. foreign aid and limited willingness among other donors to fill the gap. Ireland and the EU’s N4G pledges should be amplified to support leadership on nutrition policy globally. Champion principled humanitarian aid and international humanitarian law through the COHAFA, CODEV and COHOM working party groupings: The European Commission (DG ECHO) is preparing a non-legislative Communication on humanitarian aid for Q2 2026 which is expected to focus on three areas: a Commission-wide integrated approach to fragility, international humanitarian law, and supply chains. Although much of the preparatory work on the Communication has occurred during the current Danish presidency and the Communication will be presented under the Cypriot presidency, any Council Conclusions (and potential European Parliament resolution) will fall under Ireland’s presidency. By including sufficient COHAFA agenda time for discussion and briefings from civil society organisations who engaged in the consultation processes for the Communication, Ireland can work to ensure well-informed Council Conclusions, which will be taken into account by the Commission for the implementation of the Communication on humanitarian aid."

At a time of EU member states looking increasingly inward, closing space for civil society, and increased fragmentation of society within Europe, we must strongly champion the critical role of civil society and support efforts to foster global solidarity. Ireland’s principled position on ODA and humanitarian assistance provide an opportunity to show leadership through focusing on the values of peace, justice, human rights and solidarity in its agenda setting on foreign affairs matters in particular. These principles are key to security and stability, which are key elements of the EU’s strategic agenda for 2024 - 2029, and which are critical concerns to EU citizens."
349,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/188d1758/Dochas__-_Submission_349.docx,Dochas,,,,4,"EU citizens consistently support EU humanitarian aid and support EU engagement in partner countries. The Irish public in particular has been steadfast in its support and beliefs around ODA provision over the last six years, which emanates from a strong values base. Their understanding is founded in the belief that ODA provision must be based on human rights, humanitarianism, and shared humanity, demonstrating a clear public mandate for the Irish Government and Presidency to expand Ireland’s global engagement through aid, peacebuilding, and international cooperation. This is underscored by the fact the majority of the Irish public believes in Ireland's role on the international stage. 71% of the Irish public believes Ireland has a role to play in promoting peace and stability worldwide, further strengthening the call for an Irish Presidency promoting our soft power and founded in promoting humanitarianism, peacebuilding, and aid. Given the strong support for ODA in Ireland, we should emphasise the values and benefits that the EU provides globally, through its development and humanitarian funding. The Irish public, particularly young people, feel disconnected to the EU due to its lack of leadership in Gaza. This is an opportunity to show the positive work that the EU is supporting for communities affected by conflict, climate and hunger. Irish people want to see their values reflected in European policies and positions. Ireland’s strong Global Citizenship Education sector can be harnessed to communicate the values and benefits of the EU across regions, ages and demographics. In addition, Ireland can leverage the reach and influence of civil society organisations to showcase EU programmes that have had direct positive impact on Irish citizens, as well as those that have demonstrated Ireland’s and the EU’s values overseas. This will work towards further generating public awareness and empower civil society organisations to deliver this through their own networks and supporters. This would require financial support, capacity building opportunities and tangible inclusion in the formulation in the EU Presidency programme, essential to foster the required trust and goodwill needed to deliver joint communications and outreach."

The effective inclusion of civil society in the EU Presidency spaces and processes would enhance debate and discussion and work towards ensuring that a diversity of voices and perspectives are reflected in EU Policy making. Throughout the Presidency, Ireland can demonstrate what meaningful engagement with civil society looks like. The following are some suggestions: Work with Dóchas, the Irish network for Development & Humanitarian Organisations, who are implementing a Presidency Programme with the EU Commission that is focused on global citizenship, civil society space, financing for sustainable development, climate and food security. Dóchas members include members of the Irish Emergency Alliance, and other INGO networks, can act as a link for the Irish Government to civil society organisations, and their partners in the Global South. Create opportunities for direct engagement between civil society and ministers in the margins of or during informal meetings of EU ministers being convened in Ireland. This could be through providing speaking opportunities, inclusion in social events, inviting civil society to co-design events, and/or providing for roundtable format events to allow for broader discussion on thematic areas and support engagement between political leaders and civil society representatives. As an example, the informal meeting of EU Ministers for Development (FAC-DEV), the informal meetings of the CODEV and COHAFA working parties, are key opportunities for our sector to shine a light on issues of common concern or raise specific themes outside the legislative agenda in a conversation with civil society representatives. These formats have benefited from civil society participation and resulted in enriching discussions. Consult with civil society organisations in the development of agendas for meetings and events Utilise informal meetings of working party groupings to shine a light on specific themes and provide civil society actors a platform to speak to lived experiences and perspectives, and bring in additional expertise from specific sectors to add value to the discussions. Apply the same level and depth of engagement with civil society, as we did during Ireland’s term at the UN Security Council. During this time, Ireland used its position to bring civil society voices - particularly those from the Global south - to the centre of dialogues and debates affecting them."

Postal Regulation",Ireland,1,"Trust and Innovation in Digital Infrastructure and Services: Reliable and innovative Digital Infrastructure underpins many of the objectives in the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, for a Europe that is secure, prosperous and competitive. Resilient and secure digital infrastructure ensures a level of trustworthiness, which enables consumers to choose and use electronic communications network (ECN) and services (ECS), and digital products/services with confidence. Resilience and security, along with regulatory certainty, can also foster investment and innovation, which will in turn ensure competitiveness and strengthen the Single Market. This proposed priority aligns with the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 (pillar two, a strong and secure Europe; and pillar three, a prosperous and competitive Europe). Connectivity is the backbone of the digital transformation, which means there is an increasing criticality and reliance on digital infrastructure. Communications, including ECN/ECS and cloud, are integral technologies to our daily lives. Access, resilience and cybersecurity are critical to ensuring the trust and confidence of consumers and businesses, a critical part of the efficient function of consumers’ work and social needs. Networks need to evolve to facilitate the proliferation of technologies (including AI and IoT) across all sectors – everything from energy, to transport, manufacturing, retail, health and agriculture. Ireland’s – indeed, Europe’s - future competitiveness depends on our capacity to respond to the pace and scale of technological change. This capacity in turn is contingent on resourcing; several pieces of EU digital legislation have led to significant increases in the remit of independent regulators. These digital regulators must be adequately equipped with additional resources, particularly at senior level, to ensure that Ireland and the EU remain a regulatory hub of choice for digital industries. A failure to deliver these resources is likely to result in significant negative consequences, including economic and reputational risks for the EU. Trust: Digital networks must be reliable, resilient and secure to foster trust among consumers/users - in particular vulnerable end-users - to choose and use digital products and services safely and with confidence. Additional consumer protection in the digital space is also a focus of the upcoming Digital Fairness Act (DFA). Regulatory certainty is also an important element for both consumers and businesses, to make decisions on expenditure and investment. Reliability and Resilience: As the response to disruption to telecommunications networks and services occasioned by extreme weather events such as storms indicates, network resilience is a prerequisite for businesses and end users. Furthermore, geopolitical challenges include assuring the security of Europe’s physical and digital communications assets in the face of malfeasance by state and non-state actors. Innovation: Competition is a key driver of both innovation and investment in high-speed digital networks. The provision of innovative solutions for the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem requires a regulatory environment that facilitates the development of effective competition and innovation to the benefit of users across Europe. Both the European Commission’s “Simpler and Faster Europe” initiative and the recently published Digital Omnibus proposal have the goal of lightening the administrative burden by making regulatory obligations easier to understand and faster to implement, without compromising consumer protection. The desired outcome is to stimulate competitiveness and innovation leading to increased economic growth. The Digital Omnibus proposes to streamline existing rules on AI, cybersecurity and data in Europe. However, and from a prosperity perspective, any simplification or other legislative measures should not lead to the lowering of users’ protection, including vulnerable end-users, or create a digital divide."

Postal Regulation",Ireland,2,"ComReg suggests that the best means to identify legislative proposals for the Irish Presidency is by reference to the three pillars and key priorities of the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029. As Ireland’s Presidency occurs half-way through this period, it may be opportune to take stock of what has been achieved in the first two and a half years of this cycle and what remains to be done particularly with regards to digital infrastructure and services. The second pillar of this Agenda, ‘Strong & Secure’, lists among its various priorities: Strengthen resilience, preparedness, crisis prevention and response capacities Fight against organised crime (note - which includes cybercrime) The third pillar of this Agenda, ‘Prosperous & Competitive’, lists among its various priorities: A deeper single market, notably for energy, finance and telecommunications The green and digital transitions, including a genuine energy union and investment in game-changing digital technologies in Europe Digital Networks Act (DNA) Of particular interest to ComReg is the draft Digital Networks Act (DNA), due in January 2026. Europe’s future competitiveness depends on our capacity to respond to the pace and scale of technological change. This legislative proposal (due January 2026) will aim to reinforce competitiveness and drive a more integrated single market, while addressing challenges to the deployment of advanced networks, such as fibre, 5G/ 6G and cloud-based infrastructure. Ireland has been a key Member State in informing the European Commission’s thinking regarding many aspects of this upcoming legislation concerning digital networks/infrastructure. The DNA will also address how to tackle barriers for cross-border business operations, boost innovation and increase investment in the European electronic communications sector. These objectives will ultimately also benefit consumers/users of electronic communications networks and services, alongside the additional vertical consumer protections, and horizontal consumer protections that will be covered in another EU legislative proposal - the upcoming Digital Fairness Act (DFA). Digital Omnibus and Digital Omnibus on AI Regulation Proposal If implemented, the Digital Omnibus proposal would affect the regulatory obligations regarding AI (AI Act), cybersecurity (including for NIS2, CER, EU Digital Identity) and data (including Data Act). Clarity regarding these two simplification proposals will be crucial during the time of the Irish Presidency to provide regulatory certainty for both industry and for consumers /end users. Simplification should not be conflated with the concept of ‘reregulation’ and furthermore should not lead to the lowering of users’ protection, in particular vulnerable ones. For cybersecurity, simplifying reporting may ease the regulatory burden for industry but coordination will be required to ensure consistent and cohesive understanding across relevant regulatory bodies."

We suggest that the Irish Presidency can make the most substantial positive impact by driving forward the three pillars of the Strategic Agenda 20/24/2029 which distil down to democracy, security, prosperity. It would be useful to distinguish between the following: New projects to commence during the Irish Presidency. Existing projects to advance during the Irish Presidency. As the Council, like any organisation, does not have unlimited resources and it is necessary to acknowledge this constraint it would help to identify actions that are realistically achievable and to set reasonable timeframe for achieving them."

Postal Regulation",Ireland,4,"A challenge for institutions like the European Council and the European Commission is that citizens may only engage with them when perceived issues or inadequacies arise or when something becomes politically contentious. The steady stream of technical improvements and regulatory refinements that quietly enhance daily life of our citizens may go unnoticed and unacknowledged. This may be because large public institutions are not always as effective at communicating their achievements or demonstrating their benefits to the wider public. This problem is often compounded by the fact that critics of those same institutions can be quite effective at getting their messages across, whether in traditional media or through social media and other channels. The Irish Presidency could address this communications gap by working to highlight the ways in which life has been made better by laws and regulations. A key challenge is to simplify complex issues and to develop and disseminate easy to understand and clear accessible messages that everyone can quickly digest and understand. Many people may reply on newspapers, television, and spend time on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to get information. These channels need to be utilised to achieve wider reach for engagement and awareness. End-users can be further engaged by highlighting ‘success stories’ of the EU to date (for example, Roam Like At Home, where you can use your mobile phone service across the EU just like you use it in your home country), and how future legislative proposals, such as the DNA, will build upon these benefits to citizens and consumers. The Irish ‘AI Summit’ scheduled to take place in October 2026 during the Presidency will be a great opportunity to showcase opportunities to be unlocked in Ireland and the EU regarding the future of AI. The Communicating Europe Initiative launched in 2025 could also be broadened. This initiative supports voluntary organisations, educational bodies, civil society groups and Local Authorities in raising awareness about the European Union and Ireland’s place within it (66 projects approved for funding to date)."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (nonlegislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally.

Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities.

We would like to highlight three interlocking priorities: Moving from targets to tangible delivery should be at the heart of the Presidency. The EU has set ambitious goals on climate neutrality, circularity and strategic autonomy; the next phase must focus on making projects bankable, reducing uncertainty, and streamlining project development and permitting processes across Member States so capital can flow at the required scale and speed. Industrial decarbonisation should be explicitly linked to European security, competitiveness, and affordability. By accelerating low carbon industrial projects, resilient Critical Raw Materials (CRM) supply chains, and circular business models, the EU can simultaneously reduce dependence on external suppliers, mitigate energy price shocks and support high-quality employment across regions. The circular economy and CRM should be framed not only as environmental imperatives, but as core to Europe’s long-term industrial strategy. Harmonised and predictable rules for recycling, reuse and secondary raw materials can unlock large volumes of private investment and reduce strategic vulnerabilities in key value chains such as batteries, polymers, and fuels."
447,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e406f076/Ara_Partners_-_Submission_447.docx,,,,,2,"Given the limited duration of a Council Presidency, we suggest the Irish Presidency concentrate on a small number of enabling priorities where Council leadership can have an outsized impact on implementation: Permitting, zoning and project delivery for strategic industrial and decarbonisation assets Today, lengthy and fragmented permitting and zoning processes are one of the most significant deterrents to investment in industrial decarbonisation, CRM processing and circular infrastructure. We encourage the Irish Presidency to: Prioritise work in relevant Council configurations (notably TTE, ENVI, COMPET and ECOFIN) on mechanisms to streamline and harmonise permitting timelines and requirements for projects deemed of strategic European importance, including repurposing existing infrastructure to meet European climate priorities. Promote EU level benchmarks or indicative maximum timelines for permitting of qualifying projects, coupled with transparent monitoring and reporting by Member States. Explore instruments that link EU financial support and incentives to demonstrable progress on national level permitting reforms and administrative capacity. Consistent and timely implementation of existing EU legislation In areas such as biomethane, plastics recycling and broader circular economy legislation, the key challenge is not always a lack of EU-level ambition but uneven and delayed national implementation. This creates uncertainty for investors and can strand otherwise viable projects. The Presidency could support efforts to: Enhance monitoring and peer review of national transposition and implementation of key Green Deal and circular economy files Encourage the use of clear, enforceable minimum requirements and common methodologies where appropriate, to ensure that EU-wide legislation leads to predictable investment conditions rather than a patchwork of divergent national approaches. Provide political space in the Council for Member States to share best practices on effective implementation, particularly on topics such as waste-to-resource infrastructure, CRM recycling, and industrial decarbonisation support schemes. Industrial decarbonisation, CRMs and circular economy as core competitiveness priorities The Irish Presidency could use its role to ensure that industrial decarbonisation, CRM resilience and circularity are consistently treated as competitiveness and security issues, not niche environmental topics. Specific areas of focus could include: Facilitating progress on files and initiatives that support recycling and recovery of CRMs and other strategic materials. Encouraging policy coherence between energy, industrial, environmental and trade policies so that decarbonization projects are not undermined by conflicting signals. Highlighting and advancing measures that link circular economy solutions with lower lifecycle emissions and reduced import dependency."

By promoting enabling conditions for these projects, the Presidency can help support quality employment, skills development and regional regeneration, particularly in areas that might otherwise feel left behind by the transition. Providing a predictable and credible framework for investors and businesses Businesses of all sizes value predictability, speed and clarity. The Presidency can help by: Championing regulatory approaches that are proportionate, risk-based and coherent across sectors and Member States; Encouraging stable long-term frameworks over frequent, ad hoc changes; and Supporting platforms for constructive dialogue between EU institutions, Member States, investors, industry, and civil society."

Case studies of concrete projects across Member States — including in Ireland — can bring this to life. Highlighting EU economic and trade benefits The Presidency has an opportunity to reaffirm how the single market, common standards and shared investment frameworks enable countries like Ireland to attract investment, grow exports and participate in resilient European value chains. This narrative can help counter perceptions that EU rules are only burdensome rather than enabling. Engaging local actors and investors in the conversation Involving local authorities, community organisations, businesses and investors in Presidencylinked dialogues and events can help citizens see that EU policy is something they can influence and benefit from, rather than something distant and abstract. In our experience, direct engagement between EU institutions and the investment community is less common in Europe than in some other jurisdictions; creating structured opportunities for such engagement during the Presidency would be highly valuable."

Precisely because of this, Ireland is well-placed to use its Presidency to: Elevate implementation, permitting reform and investment conditions as cross-cutting priorities across Council configurations; Encourage stronger, more systematic dialogue between EU institutions, Member States and investors on how to unlock capital for decarbonization, CRMs and the circular economy; and Showcase Ireland’s own experience as an open, investment-friendly economy and apply lessons learned to support a more competitive and cohesive European Union."
172,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f8513e23/Indeed_-_Submission_172.docx,Indeed,,,,1,"European competitiveness through investment in people Ireland's Presidency should position European competitiveness through investment in people as its central theme. In an era of rapid AI transformation and growing global competition for talent, Europe's greatest competitive advantage lies not in technology alone, but in ensuring its workforce can adapt, innovate, and thrive. AI is already changing how people work. Indeed's AI at Work Report reveals that 4 out of 5 jobs will be affected by AI in some way. For most workers, this means learning to work alongside and orchestrate AI rather than being replaced by it, as our most recent analysis reveals only a tiny fraction of skills (0.7%) are on track to total automation. The question is not whether AI will change employment, but whether European workers will be equipped to adapt and harness the opportunities these technologies create. Ireland should champion workforce adaptability as a key Presidency priority. Two legislative initiatives provide ideal vehicles for this agenda: the Quality Jobs Act and the Fair Labour Mobility Package. Together, these strengthen the current workforce whilst making the Single Market more attractive to talent. Quality Jobs Act The European Commission's Quality Jobs Roadmap presents a crucial opportunity to integrate workforce quality and adaptability into the heart of EU employment policy, with the Act poised to modernise existing rules on worker protection while fostering competitiveness. Ireland should use its Presidency to advance the Quality Jobs Act, ensuring it delivers on key areas identified in the Roadmap such as the Skills Portability Initiative and intergenerational fairness. Responsible use of algorithmic management Indeed supports the EU’s efforts to ensure the digital transition in the workplace upholds transparency, fairness, and worker protection. The Act’s focus on algorithmic management and AI at work should reflect these priorities while also avoiding regulatory overlap with issues already addressed by the AI Act, the GDPR, and existing labour law, as recognised by the Roadmap. The Quality Jobs Act should align with EU objectives for competitive, innovation-friendly labour markets that benefit both jobseekers. Job transitions and a skilled workforce Skills and quality jobs are key drivers of EU growth. According to the Indeed Hiring Lab’s 2025 AI at Work Report 2025, nearly half (46%) of the skills in a typical job posting fall into the categories of “hybrid transformation” or “full transformation. Under the report’s framework - the GenAI Skill Transformation Index (GSTI) “hybrid transformation” refers to skills where generative AI can perform the bulk of routine tasks, but human involvement remains essential for oversight, interpretation, handling exceptions, and ensuring ethical or legal compliance. In other words: hybrid transformation is not about full automation or replacement, but about reshaping how work gets done and integrating human judgment with AI-augmented efficiency. In that context, 46% of the ~2,900 commonly listed work-skills assessed by Hiring Lab are classified as being at risk of such hybrid transformation. Given this, “AI-driven hybrid transformation” should be understood as a shift toward AI-augmented workflows in which humans and AI collaborate: AI handles repetitive or automatable tasks, while humans continue to contribute the uniquely human skills, such as judgment, oversight, creativity, and interaction, to ensure quality, adaptability, and resilience. This distinction is important: rather than seeing AI as replacing workers, the GSTI shows AI as a partner - reshaping tasks and required skills, and creating demand for new combinations of human and AI-complementary capabilities which, if managed effectively, could foster a workforce rich in critical thinking, managerial competency and creativity. However, given these transformative changes, workers need targeted support in the context of a generally weaker labour market. The Ireland Presidency should advance the Skills Guarantee to help workers in restructuring sectors transition into strategic growth areas. For example, an increase in cybersecurity related and AI ethicist roles on our platform which demonstrates one pathway for workers facing transformation in perhaps tech or tech-adjacent vocations. The Quality Jobs Act should also provide incentives for employers adopting skills-based hiring that prioritises competencies over formal qualifications. Indeed believes that skills-based hiring can open up a much broader talent pool and foster a flexible labour market. Fair Labour Mobility package Labour mobility is a cornerstone of European competitiveness. Indeed's research reveals European workers are three times more internationally mobile than their American counterparts: 16.7% have foreign work experience, compared with 5.1% in the United States. Ireland stands out with 41.9% international mobility, second only to Switzerland at 50.9%. This positions Ireland uniquely to champion policies that strengthen this competitive advantage. Skills Portability Initiative The Single Market’s full potential will be unlocked by circulating skills. Cross-border work continues to rise, with 1.8 million people commuting or teleworking across borders in 2023, demonstrating the critical need for the Skills Portability Initiative to make it easier to recognise and accept skills and qualifications across the EU, independently of where they were acquired, and promote the use of interoperable digital credentials. Today, having skills and qualifications understood by employers in other EU Member States remains challenging, particularly as diplomas are often paper-based. When a worker in Cork can have qualifications recognised in France or Germany more easily, when an SME in Galway can recruit skilled workers from across Europe without administrative barriers, EU membership's value becomes immediately clear and personal. The initiative should build on existing tools for transparency of skills and qualifications, promote interoperable digital credentials, and make it easier for qualifications to be understood and accepted across the EU, independently of where they were acquired."

This submission is presented from the perspective of both Family Carers Ireland and Eurocarers.",1,"Family Carers Ireland and Eurocarers urge the Irish Government to place family and informal carers at the centre of its presidency of the EU Council, prioritizing policies and legislation that will help achieve high-quality, affordable care services for people of all ages, that supports both care receivers and caregivers and promotes gender equality in care responsibilities. Approximately 80% of all long-term care in the EU is provided by informal carers with an economic value estimated to be €350bn per year (2.5% of EU GDP). The long-term care budget would have to double if this informal care had to be replaced by minimal formal care. Rationale: Demographic projections indicate a significant increase in demand for long-term care across the EU, with the number of people requiring care expected to rise from 30.8 million in 2019 to 38.1 million by 2050. This surge is driven by higher life expectancy and a growing share of the population aged 80 and over, creating challenges such as workforce shortages, rising costs, and the need for policy adjustments to ensure sustainable care systems. However, Europe is heavily reliant on informal care to meet the care needs of its citizens due to insufficient formal care services. This dependence on informal care carries substantial social and economic consequences for unpaid carers, including financial hardship, reduced employment opportunities, pension penalties and potential negative impacts on their physical health and wellbeing. There is an increasing recognition of the crucial role informal care plays in supporting both functional societies and the economy. This importance is highlighted by numerous reports from a range of EU institutions and international organizations, including DG EMPL, ECFIN, Santé, RTD, Connect, JUST, as well as the European Parliament, Committee of the Regions, European Economic and Social Committee, EIGE, Eurofound, WHO and OECD. These reports collectively emphasize that informal care (i) Reduces pressure on formal health and social care systems (ii) Contributes significantly to economic stability by enabling workforce participation (iii) Supports the social and emotional well-being of both care recipients and caregivers and (iv) Plays a critical role in upholding human dignity, particularly for older persons and people with disabilities. Central Proposal: In addition to the broad recommendations set out in this submission, Family Carers Ireland and Eurocarers propose, as a flagship event, hosting a two-day conference in Brussels as part of Ireland’s Presidency. The conference will explore informal care across Europe and include representatives from the Irish Government, member states, the European Parliament, and EU institutions. A draft programme for the two-day event is attached. Themes: Building a Caring Europe Together: Ensuring quality, affordable and accessible care services to improve the situation of informal carers and the people they care for, promoting person-centered care and championing the rights of the care workforce, Empowering Lives, Upholding Dignity: Advancing the rights of informal carers, children, people with disabilities, older people and all persons who need care across the EU.

Several of these principles are particularly relevant to promoting the rights and well-being of informal carers, older people and persons with disabilities: Principle 18 – Long-Term Care: Affirms the right to affordable, high-quality long-term care services, particularly home care and community-based services. During Ireland’s Presidency the focus should be on: Support and recognition of informal carers through work–life balance measures, financial supports, respite, training, and counselling. Supporting Member States to move from institutional care to home and community-based alternatives. Expanding personal assistance, respite services, day centres, and community supports. EU quality guidelines for long-term care. Person-centred care planning that respects individual preferences independent living. Development of integrated care pathways. Fair and sustainable financing models that protect households and promote EU monitoring of affordability indicators. Improving working conditions, wages and contractual stability of care workers and develop EU standards for training, skills recognition, and continuous learning. Mobilisation EU funding programmes to invest in long-term care reforms. Principle 2 – Gender Equality: Promotes equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men in all areas. During Ireland’s Presidency the focus should be on: Advancing women’s rights through the integration of gender perspectives across all policies, and targeted measures for empowering women. Pay transparency to ensure equal pay for equal work, gender reporting and penalties for employers guilty of pay discrimination. Principle 9 – Work-Life Balance: Supports the right to balance professional and caring responsibilities. During Ireland’s Presidency the focus should be on: Work Life Balance Initiatives that promote a good balance between care, family and work commitments and equal opportunities for women and men in the workplace and at home. Implementation and promotion of the Work-life Balance Directive across members states. Develop measures to protect carers from discrimination and dismissal, encourage the gender-balanced use of leave, and supports the use of European funds to improve care services. Principle 10 – Health and Safety at Work: Emphasises workers’ rights to a high level of protection for health and safety. During Ireland’s Presidency the focus should be on: Ensuring fair pay and stable contracts for professional care workers. EU-level guidance on adequate minimum wages and wage structures that reflect the skill, responsibility, and emotional labour of care work. Reducing reliance on zero-hour, precarious contracts, ensuring predictable hours and income stability. Principle 17 – Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities: Recognises the right of people with disabilities to participate in the labour market and in society, including access to enabling services. During Ireland’s Presidency the focus should be on: Ensuring access to enabling services such as personal assistance, assistive technologies and mobility aids, housing, rehabilitation, OT and community-based services and respite. Enforcement of EU accessibility laws more consistently across Member States. Improve inclusive labour market policies. Strengthening social protection and income supports for disabled people and ensure disability benefits, allowances, and pensions do not penalise people for entering work. Advancement of independent living and deinstitutionalization across member states. These principles collectively provide a framework to ensure social protection, equality, and dignity for vulnerable groups, including older persons and people with disabilities, while fostering inclusive economic and social participation."

As Ireland assumes the Presidency of the EU Council, there is an important opportunity to place informal care and long-term care at the centre of the European agenda.

Make the Irish Presidency visible and participatory: Instead of presenting the Presidency as something happening “in Brussels,” bring it home to Ireland. Host local town-hall events, listening sessions, and thematic dialogues (e.g., disability and care, climate, rural development, digital skills); Create opportunities for citizens to suggest priorities or submit ideas; Involve youth councils, NGOs, carers’ organisations, disability groups, and local volunteer networks. The more people feel consulted, the more they feel ownership. Promote co-design with NGOs and civil society: Invite NGOs, carers’ organisations, youth groups, disability and older persons organisations to co-host events; participate in Presidency working groups; lead thematic campaigns (e.g., “Ireland and Europe in 2050”), thus embedding the Presidency in community life.

This submission is presented from the perspective of both Family Carers Ireland and Eurocarers.",5,"Long-Term Care in the European Union: Challenges and Priorities Long-term care systems across the EU vary in design and maturity, but they face several common challenges: Rising Demand: The number of people needing long-term care is projected to rise from 30.8 million in 2019 to 38.1 million by 2050. Demographic changes—fewer children, families living further apart, and more women in the labour market—threaten the sustainability of traditional LTC models that rely heavily on informal carers. Unmet Needs: Many people’s care needs remain unmet due to limited LTC services, insufficient social protection coverage, and variable quality of care. In 2019, only around a quarter of people with severe difficulties in personal care or household activities received home care. Workforce Challenges: Attracting and retaining formal care workers is difficult due to low wages and challenging working conditions. Labour shortages risk leaving the job creation potential of the care economy untapped, a problem expected to worsen in the coming years. Informal Carers: Informal carers face multiple challenges, including limited access to support measures and difficulties balancing care with paid employment. Social inequalities and territorial disparities often restrict access to quality care, particularly for those from disadvantaged or rural areas. Gender Dimension: Care responsibilities disproportionately affect women, who make up the majority of both formal and informal carers. Women are more likely to leave the labour market due to care obligations and are also more likely to need long-term care themselves, but with limited financial resources. Rising Costs: Long-term care is the fastest-growing social expenditure in the EU, projected to rise from 1.7% to 2.5% of GDP between 2019 and 2050, with significant variation across Member States. Underinvestment has contributed to structural weaknesses that must be urgently addressed. The provision of quality, affordable and accessible long-term care services is one of the most significant social challenges facing the European Union. We recommend that, during its Presidency, Ireland: Adopts the theme “Building a Caring Europe Together” and prioritises policies and legislation that strengthen long-term care provision and support both informal carers and the people they care for. Hosts a European Conference: Organise a two-day conference in Brussels on long-term care and informal care, bringing together Member States, EU institutions, carers’ organisations, and stakeholders to share best practices and build a collaborative vision for the future (draft Conference Programme attached).

These themes reflect our lived experiences and our strong commitment to future-oriented, people-centred policy. 1. Peace and Security We emphasised the need for a safer, more stable Europe. Our priorities include confronting disinformation, regulating AI, and improving digital security. We see misinformation, political polarisation, deepfakes, online hate, and far-right extremism as threats to democracy and peace. We want Ireland to champion an EU-wide approach to cybersecurity, digital literacy, and online protections, including transparent age-verification and stricter oversight of harmful content. We also called for stronger humanitarian responses to conflicts, especially in Gaza and Palestine, and for a more unified EU foreign policy. We also noted divided views on the question of arming Gardaí. 2. Climate Action and a Just Green Transition We stressed that climate action must focus on affordability, accessibility, and fairness. We experience gaps in rural transport, the high cost of sustainable energy and retrofitting, and the need for greater investment in renewable infrastructure. A just transition requires targeted grants, improved public transport, sustainable housing, and supportive incentives rather than punitive measures. We also want the EU to prioritise climate education, urban planning reform, and fair treatment of farming communities. Climate anxiety is widespread among us, and we want real, immediate action—not distant targets. 3. Education, Youth Rights, and Participation We believe Ireland should prioritise strengthening education systems across the EU. This includes mental health supports in schools, reforming guidance counselling, and providing more training for teachers working with neurodivergent students, along with meaningful civic and political education. We also see the need for clear AI regulation in education so that digital tools enhance, rather than replace, critical thinking. Beyond schools, we want stronger European commitments to youth participation, including improved structures for youth voice and expanded mobility opportunities such as Erasmus+. 4. Cost of Living and Social Inclusion The cost-of-living crisis creates barriers to independence, education, housing, transport, childcare, and even access to basic necessities like period products. We want Ireland to champion EU-level action on housing affordability, energy costs, quality public services, and social protections for young people, families, and students. 5. Equality, Inclusion and Human Rights We think Ireland should prioritise gender equality, anti-racism, LGBTQIA+ rights, cultural inclusion, and equitable access to education, healthcare, and public spaces. We experience barriers linked to religion, disability, race, and low income, and we are calling for better accessibility, cultural understanding, and mental health support. We want Ireland to use its Presidency to help build a more inclusive Europe that protects minority communities and expands equal opportunities. 6. Care, Safety and Wellbeing Finally, we highlighted concerns about substance misuse, youth homelessness, and the experiences of young people in the care system. We want EU-wide approaches that prioritise prevention, trauma-informed services, and supports that give every young person stability and dignity."

Our recommendations fall into five key domains. 1. AI Regulation, Cybersecurity and the Digital Sphere We strongly support robust implementation of the EU AI Act and further work to regulate deepfake technologies, data privacy risks, and harmful online behaviour. We recommend: A licensing system for access to high-risk AI (e.g., deepfakes). EU-wide standards for age-verification and platform safety. Stronger sanctions for cybercrime, hacking, and data breaches. Investment in media literacy and digital education. 2. Climate Action, Transport and a Just Transition We want the EU to prioritise affordable, accessible climate action. We recommend: Investment in rural public transport and cross-border rail. Grants for retrofitting, solar panels, and energy-efficient homes. Regulations to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. Action on fast fashion, electronic waste, and greenwashing. Support for farmers through fair subsidies and sustainable agriculture. 3. Education, Skills, and Youth Rights We want the EU to strengthen education systems and protect young people's rights across Member States. We recommend: EU frameworks for mental health supports in schools. Teacher training for neurodivergence and inclusive education. Regulation ensuring AI supports rather than replaces learning. Expansion and promotion of Erasmus+ and youth mobility. Development of EU-wide civic and political education programmes. 4. Housing, Social Protection and the Cost of Living We highlighted urgent needs, including: EU cooperation on housing affordability and homelessness. Investment in public and student accommodation. Stronger worker protections and equal minimum wage for young people. Access to free period products and menstrual health supports. Childcare affordability and income supports for working families. 5. Equality, Anti-Discrimination, and Care Reform We want Ireland to prioritise: Gender equality and anti-racism measures. LGBTQIA+ protections. Equal access to healthcare, including mental health supports. EU-wide standards for young people in care, ensuring safety, cultural respect, and trauma-informed practice."

Across all world café tables, we consistently highlighted that EU decisions have the greatest positive influence when they reduce inequality, strengthen community resilience, improve access to essential services, support young people’s transition to adulthood, and ensure that climate and digital transitions are both fair and affordable. A clear priority for us is action that reduces the cost of living and increases socio-economic security. We highlighted that housing insecurity, energy costs, the affordability of transport, and unequal access to education create barriers that limit our mobility, opportunities, and participation in society. Measures that improve access to affordable housing, expand public transport (especially in rural regions), reduce the cost of education, and ensure equal minimum wages for young workers were frequently identified as areas where the EU Presidency can deliver tangible benefits for communities. Improving access to grants, expanding maintenance supports, and ensuring fair pathways into employment, particularly for first-time workers, were viewed as high-impact actions at EU level. Climate action was also seen as an area where the Presidency can deliver significant community benefit, provided it is approached in a way that is fair, practical, and regionally balanced. We stressed that the impact of climate change is not equal across Europe and that infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas, make climate action harder for many communities. EU-level work that focuses on affordable green transport, renewable energy accessibility, positive incentives for households and farmers, and stronger regulation of major corporate polluters was viewed as essential. We believe these measures can reduce household costs, strengthen energy security, and protect communities from increasingly severe climate impacts. Digital safety and security emerged as a major cross-cutting concern. We linked misinformation, deepfakes, online harassment, and data exploitation to declining trust, polarisation, and fears about political interference. We see the Presidency as an opportunity for the EU to strengthen media literacy, accelerate implementation of the AI Act, improve age-verification and safety standards on digital platforms, and require greater transparency from large technology companies. We emphasised that citizens, businesses, and democratic institutions all benefit from a safer, more trustworthy digital environment. We also called for EU policies that strengthen social cohesion and inclusion. We highlighted the need for improved mental health supports, better access to youth facilities, stronger protections for marginalised communities, and meaningful mechanisms for young people to influence policymaking. We stressed that investing in the wellbeing of children and young people yields long-term social and economic benefits for communities and businesses."

To create a sense of ownership over the Presidency, communication must be youth-inclusive, accessible across regions, and delivered through channels and formats that meet people where they are, including schools, youth spaces, and digital platforms. A recurring message from us was that EU communication should move beyond technical language and focus on practical impacts, demonstrating how EU decisions directly improve people’s lives. We highlighted the importance of education and civic literacy as foundational to building meaningful engagement with the EU. We strongly support the development of standardised, EU-wide civic and political education that teaches students about their rights, the functioning of EU institutions, and how they can influence policy. Many of us noted that current curricula do not equip young people to understand how EU decisions affect their lives or how to engage with EU consultations. We believe Ireland’s Presidency should be used to promote clear, accessible civic learning resources, teacher training, and digital tools that help young people understand and participate in European democracy. Communication must also address misinformation and disinformation, which we identified as one of the most significant threats to trust in the EU. We emphasised the need for large-scale public education on deepfakes, online manipulation, and AI-generated content. We recommended EU-backed campaigns that explain how to recognise misinformation, as well as stronger regulation and transparency requirements for social media platforms. We stressed that the Presidency should model responsible, factual communication and highlight the EU’s leadership in regulating AI and protecting citizens online. We also called for communication to reflect Europe’s diversity and to acknowledge the lived realities of different groups, including minorities, rural populations, migrants, LGBTQIA+ young people, and those experiencing poverty or discrimination. We expressed that citizens feel ownership when they see themselves represented and when policies respond to the issues they face- housing, mental health, transport, education, and climate action. Campaigns that showcase real stories of how EU initiatives make a difference in people’s everyday lives were seen as particularly effective. Importantly, we want communication to emphasise positive, hopeful narratives. Many of us described feeling overwhelmed by “doom messaging” around climate change, conflict, and the economy. We recommended framing the EU as a community capable of shared solutions, highlighting successful EU projects, cross-border cooperation, Erasmus+, environmental progress, and examples of social progress. Positive storytelling, combined with practical information on how citizens can participate, was viewed as essential to building a sense of collective European identity. Finally, we stressed that participation itself must be communicated as a benefit of EU membership. We advocated for opportunities to co-design policies through youth assemblies, digital platforms, local deliberation spaces, and youth-friendly consultations. We emphasised that when young people see their ideas reflected in policy outcomes, their sense of ownership and connection to the EU grows significantly."

Mental Health as a Foundational Issue Mental health emerged repeatedly for us as a core concern across all discussions, affecting education outcomes, participation in sport, social inclusion, risk of homelessness, substance use, and personal wellbeing. We described long waiting lists, inconsistent support in schools, and a lack of youth-friendly spaces. We want Ireland to champion EU-level collaboration on mental health supports, best-practice sharing, and youth-centred services, recognising mental health as foundational to all other areas of life. We also noted the importance of access to sport, arts, and leisure essential parts of youth wellbeing but often underfunded. 2. The Importance of Youth Participation We emphasised that decisions about our lives must include our voices. We proposed that every EU Member State establish structures similar to Comhairle na nÓg to ensure young people can influence policy at both local and national levels. We also recommended that EU institutions increase youth representation and enhance political education so that all young people understand their rights and can engage confidently with democratic processes. 3. The Role of AI in Society Across all themes, we returned to the transformative and disruptive impact of AI not only on job security and education but also on peace, misinformation, and democracy. We voiced concern that rapid AI development risks outpacing regulation, creating inequalities and new forms of harm. We want the EU to take a leadership role in ensuring AI supports society without undermining safety, mental health, or social cohesion. 4. Rural Disadvantage and Unequal Access to Opportunities We highlighted deep disparities between rural and urban areas in transport, youth facilities, education support, healthcare access, and employment opportunities. We stressed that EU policy must recognise rural contexts and ensure no young person is left behind because of where they live. 5. Visibility, Culture and Identity We also raised issues related to culture, the Irish language, identity, and representation. We want the EU and Ireland to strengthen support for cultural diversity, languages, and inclusive spaces where every young person can “be themselves safely.” 6. Care Systems and Trauma-Informed Practice We highlighted serious concerns about housing, staff turnover, lack of cultural recognition, and the trauma many young people in care face. We want EU-level cooperation on standards of care, advocating for consistency, safety, and child-centred, trauma-informed practice. 7. Stability, Security and Humanitarian Concerns We expressed deep concern about rising instability within and beyond Europe. Many of us highlighted the humanitarian crisis in Palestine and urged stronger, more consistent EU engagement. We also discussed increasing far-right influence across Europe and its impact on minority communities and democratic norms. Our views on public safety were mixed: some of us supported expanded Garda armed units, while others cautioned that broader arming could erode community trust."

Economic security will already feature prominently in the EU policy cycle and Ireland can drive stronger partnerships with industry on securing critical infrastructure and supply chains, strengthening foreign investment screening and improving information sharing on strategic dependencies. Within this, sanctions should remain a policy priority to align with the current mission of supporting Ukraine and countering Russian hybrid threats, as well as tackling other threats such as transnational organised crime and cyberattacks on EU critical infrastructure, businesses and individuals. The EU continues to work on enhancing its sanctions toolkit and Ireland will be well positioned to back its effective implementation and support the domestic architecture responsible for enforcement. Ireland has supported the adoption of 19 sanctions packages against Russia to date and, given the country’s own exposure to serious and organised crime threats posed by groups like the Kinahan and Hutch cartels, would be well positioned to support the refining of existing measures and to lead on the creation of a new regime. As a member state with a highly international economy, Ireland hosts a significant number of global firms whose exposure to restrictive EU measures is complex and fast evolving. Strengthening coordination between national competent authorities, improving resourcing for enforcement bodies and providing clearer guidance to the private sector on sanctions would help provide clarity and ensure more effective implementation. Using the Presidency to leverage these EU-level tools and drive improvements across the Union would also reduce compliance burdens for Irish businesses. Ireland should also frame maritime safety as a matter of national and European security. The expansion of Russia’s shadow fleet is reshaping shipping routes around Europe and growing scrutiny in the English Channel has pushed many of these ageing, poorly maintained and inadequately insured tankers westward toward Irish waters. This poses acute risks to Ireland’s maritime safety, marine ecosystems and coastal economies. Ireland should drive this issue at Council level to demonstrate leadership on a challenge that affects Ireland and the entire Union."

The Presidency should support efforts identifying gaps across existing EU restrictive measures and resolve outstanding divergences between member states. Additionally, the Presidency should promote the efforts to develop an EU sanctions regime on transnational organised crime. This might require an initial phase to gather information from relevant stakeholders and input from Member States but the ultimate aim should be the development of a new sanctions regulation. Ireland should also champion the EU’s ongoing efforts to strengthen maritime domain awareness, including advancing work on legislative frameworks such as the Vessel Monitoring Directive. Coastal states in particular face growing pressures from high-risk vessels and the EU must keep pace with this evolving threat. A key gap concerns the reporting of insurance information by vessels that enter EU waters. Although the obligation exists in principle under the Mandatory Ship Reporting Systems, implementation remains inconsistent. Ireland can play a leading role in shaping an operational and enforceable model that ensures transparency, supports safety and reduces exposure to maritime security and environmental risks. The Irish Presidency would also be best placed to encourage closer alignment between EU and UK sanctions regimes. For a member state with unique economic connections to the UK, regulatory divergence creates disproportionate complexity and cost for Irish and EU businesses that operate across both jurisdictions. Ireland should facilitate structured dialogue and coordination to simplify compliance, support competitiveness and help maintain the integrity of EU sanctions."

EU citizens would benefit from effective action against illicit finance to support the resilience of European democracy by limiting external interference, malign influence and criminal proceeds that undermine public institutions. The threats posed by Russia, transnational organised crime and Improved sanctions guidance and a more consistent regulatory landscape across the EU would reduce compliance burdens and uncertainty for EU businesses. Clearer rules allow firms to operate with confidence, allocate resources more efficiently and avoid costly regulatory inconsistencies. Enhanced enforcement coordination also creates a more level playing field across the EU, which benefits legitimate operators and strengthens the overall competitiveness of the EU economy. Communities across the EU, especially coastal and rural communities, would benefit from assertive action against the risks posed by the shadow fleet. An oil spill from an uninsured or inadequately insured tanker could devastate fisheries, tourism and local ecosystems, imposing long term economic and social costs. With these measures, Ireland would help protect livelihoods that depend directly on natural resources and coastal integrity. Thus, the Irish Presidency can demonstrate that sanctions and economic security policies have real world benefits that extend far beyond technical regulation."

National level: We advocate for timely screening and detection in several EU Member States, including Italy and Poland. 
EU level: Our work focuses on advancing legislation that enables Member States to implement timely screening initiatives. We also advocate for an EU-wide men’s health strategy with a dedicated emphasis on prostate cancer.",1,"Ireland’s 2026 Presidency presents a timely and strategic opportunity to place citizens’ health, equity and screening at the centre of the European Union agenda. As Europe faces increasing pressure from demographic ageing, growing cancer incidence and persistent health system inequalities, a Presidency grounded in people-centred health improvements would resonate strongly across Member States. LTPC recommends three overarching thematic priorities that reflect Ireland’s unique strengths, particularly its pioneering work in men’s health, and that support the European Union’s wider objectives for a fairer and healthier society. The first priority should focus on creating a healthier and more equitable Europe. Significant disparities remain in screening, diagnosis and outcomes for major diseases, including prostate cancer. It is the most common and the second most deadly cancer among men in Europe. However, access to timely diagnosis, imaging and specialised care varies greatly across Member States. Ireland is the only country in the European Union with a dedicated Men’s Health Policy and Action Plan and operates a national Prostate Rapid Access Clinic network. Ireland also participates in the PRAISE U project. These national strengths provide Ireland with a strong foundation to lead a broader European discussion on gender specific health inequalities. Prostate cancer represents an effective entry point for such a discussion because it is highly prevalent, widely recognised and closely aligned with ongoing European initiatives such as Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. The second priority should emphasise secondary prevention and timely diagnosis as key elements of future-proof and resilient healthcare systems. Across Europe, the value of prevention is well understood, but implementation remains uneven. Prostate cancer clearly demonstrates why delays in diagnosis matter. Late-stage diagnosis results in poorer clinical outcomes and a significant decline in quality of life, while placing far greater pressure on health systems. Treatment of advanced disease is approximately ten times more expensive than treatment of early-stage, potentially curable disease. Ireland has made considerable progress in streamlining diagnostic pathways, expanding Rapid Access Clinics and promoting awareness among men. This experience equips Ireland to guide a European-level conversation on how to improve screening pathways, strengthen population health literacy and expand diagnostic capacity. By drawing from its national achievements, Ireland can inspire practical and evidence-based actions that improve screening rates and reduce inequalities. The third priority should focus on building a Union empowered by data, innovation and evidence. The European Union is advancing several major initiatives, including the European Health Data Space, the EU Life Sciences Strategy and a range of innovation-focused legislative files. Ireland can play an important leadership role by ensuring that these frameworks translate into meaningful improvements for citizens. One concrete contribution would be to advance the development of an EU-level Men’s Health Indicator, beginning with prostate cancer. Such indicators could include time to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, access to imaging and access to specialised care. Introducing these indicators would support Member States in identifying gaps, tracking progress and developing outcome-based policies."

EU level: Our work focuses on advancing legislation that enables Member States to implement timely screening initiatives. We also advocate for an EU-wide men’s health strategy with a dedicated emphasis on prostate cancer.",2,"Ireland’s 2026 Presidency presents a strategic opportunity to advance policy areas where European cooperation can improve screening, timely diagnosis and outcomes for major diseases. Given Ireland’s recognised leadership in men’s health and its strong national record in prostate cancer awareness and care, the Presidency could play a decisive role in elevating prostate cancer and broader men’s health considerations within key European Union policy frameworks. This focus would support more equitable and resilient healthcare systems across the Union. A first area of focus should be the implementation of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, particularly the Council Recommendations on cancer screening. These Recommendations aim to expand screening programmes, yet implementation across Member States remains uneven. Prostate cancer illustrates this clearly. It is one of the most common and most deadly cancers among men in Europe, yet access to screening, diagnostic imaging and follow up care differs substantially between countries. Screening programmes are only effective if men participate, yet participation rates remain as low as twenty to thirty per cent in some Member States. Ireland is well placed to highlight these inconsistencies and encourage more coordinated action. By promoting public awareness, health literacy and communication strategies that motivate men to respond to screening invitations, Ireland can help ensure that screening programmes deliver impact. Ireland’s experience with streamlined diagnostic pathways, its national Prostate Rapid Access Clinic network and its participation in the PRAISE U project, including pilots led by Mr David Galvin exploring innovative PSA sampling, provide practical models for Member States. Ireland can promote risk based prostate cancer screening models and support improvements in participation rates, follow up diagnostics and specialist referrals. A second area that merits attention is the EU Life Sciences Strategy. This Strategy will shape European approaches to research, innovation and health literacy and offers a platform to support targeted and risk stratified prostate cancer screening pilots. Ireland’s National Men’s Health Policy and Action Plan provides a clear proof point of how gender specific health considerations can be embedded into policy through structured indicators, targeted awareness initiatives and coordinated care pathways. These elements demonstrate how national approaches can be replicated within the Life Sciences Strategy to ensure that innovation and health literacy initiatives respond to the needs of men. Ireland should advocate for the integration of such mechanisms to improve screening participation and reduce disparities in access to diagnostics. A third relevant policy area concerns the Innovation Act and the Biotech Act. These initiatives aim to expand Europe’s capacity to develop and deploy new health technologies. Ireland can encourage the inclusion of gender specific and disease specific health needs within innovation assessment frameworks, ensuring that diagnostic tools, imaging technologies and clinical investigations respond to diseases such as prostate cancer. A fourth opportunity lies in the European Health Data Space. High quality, sex disaggregated and disease specific data are essential for identifying inequalities and guiding policy. Ireland can promote comprehensive indicators, beginning with prostate cancer, to help Member States benchmark progress and identify gaps in screening and diagnostic pathways."

These areas directly influence the quality of life of European citizens and contribute to the resilience and efficiency of health systems. By drawing on its national experience in men’s health and its strong reputation for practical and people-centred policymaking, Ireland can guide Council work that delivers tangible improvements across Member States. A first way the Presidency can improve outcomes for people is by supporting earlier and more accurate diagnosis of major diseases through effective screening pathways. Prostate cancer provides a clear example. Without structured screening, most cases are diagnosed only once symptoms appear, often at an advanced stage when treatment options are limited and prognosis poorer. If Ireland encourages Member States to strengthen screening pathways and diagnostic capacity, citizens will benefit from shorter waiting times, improved access to imaging and more timely referrals to specialist services. These improvements are visible to the public and are perceived as indicators of a functioning and equitable healthcare system. A second area of impact concerns communities and local health systems. Many regions across Europe face shortages in diagnostic capacity, unequal access to specialist care and limited health literacy. Guided by Ireland’s experience with Rapid Access Clinics and targeted awareness campaigns, the Council can promote actions that help Member States share best practices, identify system gaps and invest effectively in screening and secondary prevention. Strengthening these elements reduces avoidable pressures on hospitals and helps ensure that communities receive sustainable and responsive healthcare. A third area of impact relates to the broader European economy and businesses in the health and life sciences sectors. When health systems articulate clear needs and when policies support innovation that responds to real population challenges, businesses can invest with confidence. The Presidency can contribute by advancing outcome-oriented frameworks under the Innovation Act and the Biotech Act. Integrating gender specific and disease-specific indicators, including those related to prostate cancer, will support the development of diagnostic tools, digital health solutions and clinical research aligned with the needs of European citizens. A fourth contribution relates to cohesion and solidarity within the European Union. Reducing inequalities in screening and treatment strengthens citizens’ expectations that they can access timely and high-quality care regardless of where they live. Council work focused on equity strengthens trust in public institutions and reinforces the principle that European cooperation delivers measurable and meaningful benefits. Through leadership in these areas, Ireland’s Presidency can improve daily life for citizens, support stronger communities, create clearer conditions for innovation and contribute to a more resilient and cohesive European Union."

Communication should focus on themes relevant to people’s daily lives, demonstrate clear and measurable benefits and reflect Ireland’s longstanding commitment to fairness, inclusion and public health. By grounding its communication in practical improvements to health and well-being, Ireland can help citizens across the Union see the Presidency as directly relevant to their own interests. A central element of this approach should be the use of health as a tangible and relatable example of European added value. Citizens consistently identify health as an area where cooperation across borders can make a real difference. By emphasising how improved screening pathways, more equitable diagnostic access and consistent standards of care can save lives, reduce anxiety and shorten waiting times, the Presidency can demonstrate how European-level action improves daily life. Prostate cancer provides a clear and relatable illustration, affecting families in every Member State and offering a compelling example of where cooperation can deliver visible improvements. A second way to strengthen citizen ownership is to highlight Ireland’s leadership in men’s health and its commitment to fairness and equity. As the only Member State with a national Men’s Health Policy and Action Plan, and with established Prostate Rapid Access Clinics and participation in PRAISE U pilots, Ireland can present its Presidency as grounded in experience and public health expertise. Sharing these best practices demonstrates how national strengths can benefit the wider Union. A third way to enhance public engagement is to involve civil society, patient organisations, clinicians and community groups in Presidency activities. Including these voices ensures that communication is participatory rather than top-down. Citizens are more likely to feel connected to the Presidency when they see individuals like themselves represented and when their concerns are acknowledged. This approach deepens trust and reinforces the principle that the European Union is shaped not only by its institutions but also by the communities it serves. A fourth communication opportunity lies in sharing positive and practical stories of cooperation. Highlighting examples of strengthened screening pathways, improved diagnostic infrastructure, or successful community-based prevention efforts helps citizens understand how European initiatives translate into local benefits. These stories should emphasise partnership, collective progress and the shared goal of improving public health. By focusing on relatable themes, showcasing national leadership, engaging diverse voices and presenting clear and evidence-based examples of impact, Ireland can help citizens feel more connected to the European project and take pride in the 2026 Presidency."

As a multistakeholder and expert-led platform bringing together clinicians, patient advocates, researchers and public health organisations, LTPC is committed to supporting evidence-based policies that improve outcomes for men across Europe. Prostate cancer remains one of the most significant health challenges affecting European men. Its impact extends beyond mortality to quality of life, mental health and social wellbeing. Although this submission has focused on prostate cancer as an urgent entry point for broader European action on men’s health, LTPC emphasises that this should contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of gender specific health needs throughout the lifespan. Ireland’s national Men’s Health Policy and Action Plan, its Rapid Access Clinic network and its participation in the PRAISE U project demonstrate how structured interventions can improve awareness, support help-seeking behaviour and strengthen care pathways. Ireland’s Presidency also provides an opportunity to reinforce the country’s international leadership. Very few countries globally have developed a framework comparable to Ireland’s approach to men’s health. By embedding men’s health considerations within key European Union initiatives, Ireland can contribute to shaping global discussions on screening, health promotion and cancer control. Finally, LTPC would welcome continued engagement with Irish authorities during the preparation phase of the Presidency. Our expert group stands ready to provide evidence, insights and best practices that may support the development of proposals related to screening pathways and health equity.

Without adequate flexibility, Member States face increased cost in the form of renewable curtailment, inefficient use of grid assets and price fluctuations. Other activities - Supporting events: SupergridEurope encourages the Irish Presidency to advance the four priorities listed above by organising energy policy-related events under the auspices of the EU Presidency. SupergridEurope are in discussions with partners in Brussels and Ireland to cooperate on: Q1 2026 event in Ireland to put focus on the energy initiatives expected from the upcoming Irish precedency. The intention is a broader discussion on Irish EU priorities to a wider stakeholder group to allign on EU energy priorities, agree why these are important in Ireland and abroad, idenfify messages and use participants to amplify – in Ireland and abroad, rallying support for Irish EU priorities. Q2: Informal event to communicate the priorities of the EU Presidency to Brussels stakeholders, including Permanent Representations, European Parliament, Commission, ACER, and the ENTSOs. H2 2026: SupergridEurope and Trifecta Ireland would be eager to contribute to activities during the informal Energy Council meeting in Ireland."

Specifically, Energia supports a focus on EU security, competitiveness, and simplification. With regards to security, electrification powered by renewables and flexibility is the surest route to energy security. As a world-leader in building a renewables-led system, Ireland has an important role to play in promoting electrification and security of supply at the European level. This can be achieved through simplifying and accelerating the planning, permitting and connecting procedures for new generation, strengthening the EU Energy Union through our integrated electricity markets, and building a grid that is fit for an electrified Europe. In addition to energy security across Europe, energy security within Europe should also be an important theme of Ireland’s presidency. With regards to energy, each member state is bound by the reality of their own unique geographical location and the historic development of their market. As such, each member state must be responsible for ensuring the security of supply of its system and taking the necessary steps appropriate to their market. As a small-island system on the edge of Europe with strong links to non-EU countries, Ireland is well placed to represent this view through the Presidency. For example, while promoting interconnection generally across Europe is important for security of supply and competitiveness, each member state will have a level of interconnection linked to the size and physical characteristics of their market beyond which further interconnection can lead to increased dispatch down of renewable generation and challenges for national security of supply. EU policy should allow for these national characteristics to be accounted for as required. On competitiveness, strengthening and deepening Europe’s electricity market and promoting the increased participation of new technologies and demand response is the route to lowering prices and incentivising innovation. Ultimately, the largest gains for competitiveness and affordability will come from improved grid which promotes flexibility, gets more zero-cost-marginal renewables onto the system and lowers imperfections costs. On simplification, reducing the administrative burden on the delivery of new generation and grid and breaking down barriers to customer participation in the renewable transition can only be positive in delivering the EU’s energy transition and the attainment of the climate targets."
318,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a04414c8/Energia_-_Submission_318.docx,Energia,,,,2,"Energia is committed to powering the energy transition in a socially, environmentally, and ethically responsible manner. Through this, Energia supports a strengthened 2040 climate goal ambition that provides clarity and certainty to investors, communities, and customers alike. The Presidency should prioritise the underlying delivery mechanisms that contribute to the rollout of renewables, at appropriate scale and least cost. Aligned with Ireland’s national priorities, this includes streamlined permitting, increased simplification, improved market design, and greater support for storage and flexibility. A successful delivery of the 2040 climate targets will put us on course for climate neutrality by 2050, protect the EU’s competitiveness and strengthen our strategic autonomy. Furthermore, Energia supports the continued alignment of these 2040 goals with the EU Competitiveness Compass, Clean Industrial Deal, and Affordable Energy Action Plan. Energia believes that grid reinforcement, operational resilience, and system flexibility are primary enablers of further renewable growth. Through the rollout of the European Grids Package, Energia advocates for these priorities to be kept at its core. The focus should be on optimising and strengthening domestic grids, to accommodate for increasing renewable penetration. It will be essential to the energy transition to build a resilient, reliable, and future-proofed grid. Member State’s should have the freedom to assess and determine what would be the best approach for their own systems, and as such it will be important that the regulation surrounding this topic is non-prescriptive. A resilient and optimised grid is fundamental to delivering renewable energy at a lower cost, minimising imperfection costs, and ensuring reliable system performance as variable generation increases in the system. Key Presidency priorities related to this should include the acceleration of strategic grid reinforcement, enhanced operational flexibility, and reduced constraints and curtailment through improved planning and grid management. Energia also supports a focus on the Electrification Action Plan, which will support accessible and affordable electrification of heat, transport, and industry. Customer-centred electrification, supported by smart technology and tariffs, demand-side flexibility, and targeted assistance for vulnerable households, can materially reduce whole-system costs by shifting demand into periods of high-renewables on the system. Energia advocates for the implementation of this action plan to prioritise affordability, clarity, and investment certainty in order to deliver benefits for both domestic users and energy-intensive industrial sectors. Across all policy areas, Ireland in its Presidency should aim to push forward evidence-based, non-prescriptive regulation that gives room for the diversity of the Member States’ systemic nuances and complexities. By focusing on these policy areas through the lens of competitiveness, affordability, and security of supply, Energia believes that the Presidency can help to further the energy transition in a way that will help bolster Europe’s resilience and economic stability."

As a vertically integrated utility operating over 1.1GW renewable and flexible generation and supplying over 912,400 customer sites across the island of Ireland, Energia is committed to an Irish EU council presidency which drives a competitive and secure energy transition. While Ireland’s Presidency will encompass a broad range of priorities, this submission is focused on the areas identified as most relevant to Energia’s business. Energia recognise that there are clear intersections with wider aspects of the Presidency agenda, and as such the below recommendations are framed with these crossovers in mind. The Presidency provides a valuable opportunity to advance priorities that underpin Europe’s economic and energy resilience, the just energy transition, and the EU 2040 – 2050 climate ambitions. These include simplification of regulation, improved and clarified market design, and accelerated grid reinforcement to maximise indigenous renewables potential and reduce system constraints. A strong focus on electrification and flexibility will help lower whole-system costs, improve affordability, and bolster European competitiveness. Security of supply must remain central, with resilient domestic infrastructure and operational flexibility ensuring stability through the transition. Energia urges the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure Ireland uses its Council Presidency to promote a nuanced and holistic approach to electricity interconnection. The presidency can recognise that there are significant benefits to interconnection but is cognisant of the challenges and risks of a system that is over-reliant on interconnection such as excessive curtailment of indigenous renewables or the viability of domestic security of supply and system stability. In the context of competitiveness and security, Ireland has a valuable opportunity to prioritise and streamline simplified policies that accelerate the development of domestic grids to maximise the use of indigenous renewables. Energia is confident that Ireland’s insights from being a small-island system located on the edge of Europe with a high-level of renewable penetration will add enormous value to its term in the Presidency."

Ireland’s leadership in brain health, interdisciplinary research, public engagement and skills development positions it to champion themes that address major health and innovation challenges while emphasising collaboration, societal impact and economic value. These themes directly support the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, advancing health resilience, digital transformation, research competitiveness, and sustainable economic growth. They align with the mission of the wider EU brain research community to promote cooperation between brain research organisations and other stakeholders, consistently promoting dialogue between scientists, industry and society. 1. Elevating Brain Health as a Central Societal and Economic Priority Brain health is fundamental to wellbeing, workforce participation and economic resilience. Neurological, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions impose growing social and financial burdens across Europe, with estimated annual costs exceeding €800 billion, underscoring the economic imperative for coordinated EU action. Ireland is particularly well placed to foreground this issue, with world-leading expertise in dementia, ageing, prevention, genomics, neuroscience, neuroimaging, digital health and precision medicine. Irish researchers have contributed to major breakthroughs through population-based studies, advanced genetic epidemiology and high-impact Phase 1 clinical trials. Ireland also hosts strong biomedical and neural-engineering programmes that support technological innovation. Highlighting brain health would allow Ireland to underscore the societal benefits of prevention and early intervention, alongside the economic importance of reducing the long-term burden of neurological disease. 2. Promoting Integrated Research Ecosystems that Deliver High Impact Ireland’s research landscape demonstrates how collaboration across universities, hospitals, industry and patient groups can accelerate discovery and deliver tangible societal and economic benefits. Irish-state supported research centres such as FutureNeuro, the Global Brain Health Institute, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, ADAPT, Insight, APC Microbiome, CÚRAM, Galway Neuroscience Centre, Centre for Pain Research, Ageing Research Centre and the Neuroimaging and Cognitive Genomics Research Centre illustrate the value of connecting basic science, engineering, clinical research and data-driven technologies. By emphasising integrated research ecosystems, Ireland can highlight how coordinated, cross-sectoral approaches generate high-impact science, foster innovation, and stimulate economic activity. 3. Strengthening Public and Patient Involvement to Enhance Societal Impact Ireland’s strong culture of public and patient involvement (PPI) is a distinctive national advantage. Advocacy organisations—particularly those within the Neurological Alliance of Ireland—work closely with researchers and clinician scientists to ensure studies reflect real-world needs and lived experience. This commitment to co-production enhances the societal relevance of research, builds public trust, and supports more effective translation of new findings into practice. Positioning PPI as a priority would allow Ireland to showcase the value of meaningful engagement for improving outcomes, strengthening public confidence and increasing the societal impact of research. 4. Investing in Skills and Talent for Long-Term Scientific and Economic Resilience Ireland’s growing talent base in genomics, data science, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, digital health and AI demonstrates the importance of sustained investment in people.

The Irish Presidency should support coordinated implementation across Member States, promoting interoperability and ensuring that governance structures for the secondary use of health data are robust, trusted and research-friendly. Particular emphasis should be placed on facilitating responsible access for scientists, clinicians and innovators while maintaining strong safeguards for privacy and cybersecurity. The Presidency can also promote alignment between national digital health systems and the EHDS architecture to accelerate early benefits for patients and health systems. Ireland should also play a leading role in supporting implementation of the AI Act, helping to ensure that Europe’s AI ecosystem is both competitive and trustworthy. The Presidency is an opportunity to champion the implementation of the National Strategy for Accelerating Genetic and Genomic Medicine in Ireland, to optimise patient outcomes through precision medicine, attract clinical trials while leveraging the Irish research community to drive discovery and innovation. Ireland should also support work towards the development of a comprehensive EU Coordination Plan for Brain Health, recognising the growing burden of neurological, neurodegenerative and mental health conditions. In parallel, the Presidency could prioritise coordinated EU action on mental health by advancing implementation of the EU Mental Health Strategy, promoting integration of mental health indicators within the European Health Data Space, and strengthening support for prevention and early-intervention research, particularly in youth mental health. The Presidency can build on ongoing implementation of the ERA Policy Agenda 2025–2027, which aims to improve research careers, mobility and open science practices across Member States. The European Research Area Act offers a unique opportunity for the Presidency to advocate for measures that tackle longstanding challenges in Europe’s research ecosystem. There is also an opportunity for Ireland to further promote cross-border training and mobility programmes. There is a growing need to support clinician–scientist pathways that bridge clinical practice and research. Ireland can highlight this as both a workforce and innovation priority and could initiate a roadmap for strengthening clinician–scientist careers as part of Europe’s broader health workforce strategy."

This concentrated expertise also strengthens industry partnerships, attracts global investment and talent, and supports the expansion of Ireland’s medtech clusters. Strong public and patient involvement underpin evidence-based research and prevention initiatives, providing a strong platform for leadership at the European level. Despite these strengths, gaps in infrastructure, fragmented data systems, limited neurorehabilitation services, workforce constraints, and the absence of a unified National Brain Health Plan present significant opportunities for development. A key priority lies in the creation of modern, integrated research infrastructure. Expanding digital health records and establishing a national Trusted Research Environment would allow researchers to securely link clinical, imaging, genomic, and outcomes data, accelerating discovery and enabling large-scale population studies. Increasing neuroimaging capacity outside Dublin and supporting the growth of national registries and biobanks within a robust ethical and governance framework would broaden participation in clinical research and enhance Ireland’s attractiveness for international collaboration. Sustained, long-term investment is essential to maintain and grow Ireland’s research excellence. Additional multi-year funding programmes would allow universities, hospitals, and community organisations to plan strategically, build stable research teams, and develop world-class facilities. Strengthening translational research infrastructure, from advanced preclinical laboratories to high-end clinical imaging, would facilitate the movement of discoveries from the laboratory to clinical application. Expanding structured PhD programmes, postdoctoral pathways, and early-career supports would reinforce the talent pipeline and ensure the next generation of researchers has clear and attractive career trajectories. Improving neurorehabilitation represents another major opportunity. Enhancing access to specialist services, developing consistent regional provision, and expanding pathways for both mild and moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury would improve patient outcomes while generating valuable clinical research data. Embedding outcomes evaluation into rehabilitation programmes and providing structured supports for caregivers would strengthen service design and create evidence base capable of informing best practice across Europe. Developing talent, particularly clinician-scientists, is crucial to Ireland’s future competitiveness. Structured career pathways in neurology, psychiatry, rehabilitation, and related fields, combined with training in AI, data science, and translational neuroscience, would help retain highly skilled professionals and bridge the gap between scientific discovery and clinical care. Strengthening collaboration between clinical and academic institutions and recognising research as a core component of high-quality care would further integrate research into the health system. Finally, a unified National Brain Health Plan would consolidate existing strategies across neurology, psychiatry, neurodevelopment, rehabilitation, prevention, and research, reducing fragmentation and providing a clear framework for long-term implementation. Reinforcing collaboration across disciplines, institutions, and sectors, and linking researchers with clinicians, industry, and patient organisations, would amplify Ireland’s translational impact, scientific visibility, and competitiveness for international funding. By capitalising on these opportunities, Ireland can significantly strengthen its brain health ecosystem and position itself as a leader in European brain health research and innovation during its 2026 Presidency and beyond."

A renewed EU commitment to cooperative security, climate diplomacy, humanitarian solidarity, and fair global financing signals that Europe will not retreat into geopolitical fragmentation or transactionalism. Ireland can convene member states, civil society, and global South partners to restore confidence in shared rules, evidence-based negotiation, and long-term commitments. Also prioritise mechanisms that strengthen transparency, accountability, and inclusive representation so multilateralism becomes more democratic, responsive, participatory, and resilient in the decades ahead. Intergenerational Equity - The principle of “leave no one behind” also requires policies attentive to the needs of future generations. Ireland should therefore elevate intergenerational fairness from rhetoric to operational principle: embedding youth participation in EU policy cycles, integrating future-impact assessments in climate, digital, and budget decisions. The Presidency should include formal youth advisory structures where delegates participate alongside official representatives that include long-term risk planning, protection of planetary boundaries, and the establishment of a Future’s Commissioner so today’s progress does not sacrifice the wellbeing of future generations. Accelerated SDG Delivery through Financing, Partnerships, and Monitoring - Ireland’s EU Presidency should champion an EU SDG Acceleration Declaration, pushing for innovative financing (e.g. blended finance, green bonds) and a regular EU-wide SDG review process. This should be supported by evidence-based, actionable approach to localising global goals and improving supporting data systems. Education/upskilling is also vital to success. The SDGs remain the indispensable global framework for sustainability and justice and is a living testament to Ireland’s leadership and soft power at the UN. Inclusive, Rights-Centred Digital Governance & AI Ethics - Ireland’s EU Presidency should advance digital commitments for universal internet access, safe and inclusive digital spaces to bridging the digital divide and advance human-rights focused AI governance structures especially focused on protection of young people. Ireland should lead an authentic EU Digital Trust & Inclusion initiative, focusing on digital literacy, equitable access, AI transparency, and data governance aligned with the rights of people and planet so that emerging technologies benefit all. A Just Transition of ‘Leaving No One Behind’ in Practice - Ireland’s EU Presidency should use EU social cohesion mechanisms and funds to target support for rural, island and disadvantaged communities; promote equitable recovery, job creation, and training especially in energy and digital sectors. There should be an overt commitment to equity, social inclusion, and support for vulnerable populations as we advance a critical green transition focused on a more secure and competitive Europe. Strengthening Science-Policy Integration, Research and Capacity-Building - Ireland’s EU Presidency should launch an EU Research & Sustainability Policy Lab that links scientific experts, academia, and EU institutions which aim to produce policy briefs, identify research needs, and pilot initiatives that bridge the gaps amongst researchers, policy makers and policy practitioners. Ireland should embed science, research and data-driven policy into the heart of EU decision-making especially with regards to supporting sustainable development, green competitiveness, technology governance, and human rights."

Highlight how EU membership enables Ireland and its citizens to contribute and at times lead EU implementation of climate action, social inclusion, sustainable development, environmental protection, and global solidarity. Connect EU Action to Everyday Lives - Showcase success stories that are meaningful to the lives of individuals, families and communities including local initiatives in green infrastructure, digital inclusion, rural development, coastal resilience, healthcare, education, and EU funded projects. Celebrate our success but acknowledge shortcomings and areas to improve. Engage Citizens Directly - Launch an Irish Presidency Citizen Forum, facilitate online and local town-hall consultations, inviting citizens to propose priorities, comment on draft Presidency initiatives, and shape how EU-level decisions reflect local context. Include youth and future generations: create youth advisory panels for the Presidency, link with schools and third-level institutions to align with intergenerational equity goals. This could also be linked to the existing citizens assembly. A Platform for National Strength & Global Voice - Position EU membership as amplifying Ireland’s voice internationally: through climate diplomacy, global development, digital governance while reinforcing sovereignty by collaborating, not isolating. Convey solidarity - remind citizens that many challenges (climate change, pandemics, economic shocks, disinformation) are transnational and EU membership offers collective strength and shared burden. Tell the story on how the EU stood behind Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement during Brexit negotiations. Celebrate the Presidency - Brand the 2026 Presidency as a moment for Ireland to lead Europe and invite citizens to “own” it. Use storytelling, the arts, cultural events, public media campaigns, social media, community events, and civil society engagement to make it relatable."

At around 15% of all spending in EU, public institutions are one of the largest consumers in Europe (Public Procurement Database, Europe 2025). This is public procurement, and it is the catalyst through which Europe can drive population health, create a new meaning of competitiveness, and be the concrete manifestation of abstract values. Procurement is an excellent theme because cuts through all the themes of The EU Presidency; it gathers many different stakeholders – from farmers, to legal experts, to innovators, to health practitioner, to policymakers, to justice & equity stakeholders – in a forum that galvanises all of us in a common purpose; it has tangible goals and outcomes that can be felt by Europeans on the ground. Competitiveness: what incentives/disincentives are structurally within the procurement system that we want to enhance or replace? How can we change tax and subsidy levers to make sustainable/ecological/local options more affordable for public institutions? How can we use platforms and clearing houses to enable small and micro suppliers into the system? How can we easily verify sustainability claims? How can we ensure that compliance is the same amount of work for any supplier, large or small? What can we learn from other disciplines or areas of the economy that informs our perspective on competitiveness? Values: what types of values do we want to imbue in public procurement, and how do these differ regionally, and across goods? For example, food procurement might be envisioned as local, slow, less complex, and ecological. Medical procurement might be envisioned as scaled and speedy. What innovations are needed in supply chains to get the values we want? For example, how can we have less packaging in procurement, reward local producers, incentivise slow production techniques? How can we share goods and services with nearby institutions in frictionless and workable ways? Are there lessons from other economic domains on using supply chains to articulate values? How can the culture of public institutions change to become less materially intensive, or more frugal, and what are the hidden dangers in such culture shifts? What conflicts of interest exist between public and private exchanges of goods and services, and how can we improve this? Security: resilience is defined as ‘the ability of a system to recover from perturbation, the ability to repair itself’ (Meadows Thinking in Systems p.78). Its opposite is, surprisingly, stability (Meadows p. 77). Too much stability in a system makes it brittle and prone to systemic breakdown, but we desire stability as it drives productivity. Long, complex supply chains have huge stability benefits, and low resilience ones. What technology and metrics are available to measure ‘security’, and how can these be incorporated into decision dashboards? How much security is in our procurement is a balance of resilience and stability – have we got the right combination? For example, Ireland exports 90% of food it grows; it is one of the most nitrogen-intensive users in the world by size. This has resulted in stability (high productivity) but low resilience.

We posit that the “structure of feeling” (Williams 1978) within Europe is that this logic and rhetoric is wearing thin, and we should grasp a mechanism such as procurement to embody and enact the vision, rather than articulate it in strategy documents, launches, websites and so on. The work of the Council could actually adopt a different tone-of-voice to that which everyone expects, and play with the idea of boring. Procurement is seen to be boring, but it is the secret spine that that stimulates: Innovation – legislative innovation on how to design policy and legislation to even the playing field, incorporate radical values, be hyper-local, massively micro, and so on.

The housing crisis in Ireland remains the defining and most urgent issue in our society, and has been a dominant problem for the better part of the last 20 years. It is negatively impacted and shaped the lived experience of multiple generations and continues to cast a long shadow over our collective future. This issue is not just confined to Ireland. A recent research paper, “One roof, many realities: Europe’s complex housing crisis”, published by the Council of the European Union, clearly illustrated that this is a Union-wide problem. Affordability is one of the key issues when it comes to housing. Average housing prices have risen by 91.8% in Ireland between 2015 and 2025, and across Europe they have surged by 60.5%. As access to housing is increasingly constrained by unaffordable costs, the ensuing scarcity and precarity that people experience profoundly impacts them in vast number of ways. Essentially every social challenge that we must confront in both Ireland and the wider EU, from poverty and inequality to mental health, addiction, social cohesion and community development can be linked to a lack of access to housing. We must recognise this impact and reframe housing in a way that reflects its role at the heart of our society; as a fundamental human right and an essential social good. As the Council of the European Union’s recent research paper outlines, institutional investors such as private equity firms and real estate funds have been increasingly active in housing markets across the EU. For these entities, housing is primarily treated as a financial asset or investment vehicle. This is at odds with a recent statement made by President Ursula von der Leyen who said in September 2025 “Housing is about dignity. It is about fairness. And it is about Europe’s future. Eight years ago, the European Pillar of Social Rights made housing a social right in Europe. It’s time to turn this promise into reality”. It is impossible to reconcile this position with those who profit from the financialisation of housing and who are increasingly expanding their influence over housing markets. Since 2017, nearly half of all units in Ireland have been purchased by investment funds. In Sweden, institutional investors own 24% of private rental apartments. In the four largest Dutch cities, investors have bought a quarter of homes sold in recent years. The provision of social and affordable housing becomes even more challenging in the context of this landscape. Ireland should be using its Presidency of the Council to explore and examine how the EU can respond to this challenge. While there are significant variances across member states in their national housing problems, it is still the most profound and common issue that is shared among the citizens of the EU. It would be utterly irresponsible to dismiss these shared crises as a matter solely for national competence, and responding to them would be a way to show how meaningfully the EU’s actions can impact on the lives of Europeans."

These supports should aim to increase state capacity for the provision of public and social housing, increase areas of innovation in the construction sectors to challenge the significant cost increases that the sector has faced over the last decade, and provide access to capital for states to embark on ambitious and radical housing policy. How housing is being viewed within the EU is shifting. The first ever European Affordable Housing Plan is set to be published next week. The Housing Advisory Board issued 15 recommendations to the European Parliament last week outlining the need for a “paradigm shift, so housing is seen as essential social as well as economic infrastructure and discourage the ‘financialisation’ of housing, where it is valued as a speculative asset rather than someone’s long term home”. The provision of social housing should be central to illustrating housing as an essential social good. The Board called for a reframing of affordability in the context of vibrancy and health of neighbourhoods and local communities, ending homelessness and taxing short term rentals as a means to fund these efforts. They suggested the promotion of cost rental models which, importantly, calculated rent based on actual costs of housing provisions rather than linked to market rents. Importantly in an Irish context, the Board recommended that there should be a focus on the efficient use of existing buildings and on urban regeneration, with a keen awareness to avoid displacement in these efforts. It is well documented that there are over 160,000 vacant homes in Ireland, and roughly 20,000 derelict properties. Tackling this should be a central policy focus during Ireland’s presidency. Another key recommendation that came from the Board was to insure minimum protection for tenants. They suggested that rental accommodation should “at a minimum, not pose a threat to the health and safety of tenants” and outlined how homelessness prevention should be made into a statutory obligation within national legal frameworks. The recommendations also included a call to amend State aid rules to help with housing provision. The EU has shown that it can provide significant resources to facilitate defence spending across member states, with the SAFE instrument providing €150 billion in loans for common procurement of defence equipment backed by the EU budget. EU Recovery funds that are due to cease in 2027 also showed how the Union was able to respond with huge resources to the challenges presented by the pandemic, with the largest stimulus package ever financed in Europe. The Board singled out existing financial instruments such as InvestEU to accelerate affordable housing supply. These instruments should also extend to the provision of social housing. The housing crises across member states are having immediate and profound impacts on the lives of millions of EU citizens right now. The intersection of these crises and the myriad of problems that are tearing the social fabric apart across the continent cannot be denied."

Therefore, we need to address how delivery of a radical re-framing can be achieved. Something that is often communicated by the Irish Government is that the State does not have the capacity to finance wide-spread provision of public housing. Another key recommendation from the Housing Advisory Board was to fund better competence in assessing the financing and wider impacts of housing projects. They suggested that public authorities needed to strengthen financial literacy in housing project evaluation and public officials should be able to analyse housing project finances to be able to assess the real funding needs of projects and use subsidies more effectively. These types of measures are key to ensuring we can begin to build capacity within the State to effectively and efficiently deliver housing in a manner that can assess economic, social and environmental impacts simultaneously and find meaningful paths forward. Another issue that is raised is the State’s access to capital. Alongside the expansion of dedicated financial instruments designed for the provision of social and affordable housing, the Housing Advisory Board’s suggestion of the creation of a pan-European Affordable Housing Investment Fund could be a way to leverage the financial power of states collectively for the common good to create an EU-wide housing investment platform, investing equity and debt in different Member States into diversified forms of strictly regulated affordable housing and supporting infrastructure. Again, these mechanisms should also be explored for the provision of social housing. It is critical that we begin to develop state and EU led mechanisms that can shift away from our reliance on speculation by private investors for the provision of housing. This reliance will continue to have disastrous impacts on the lives of EU citizens and will continue to maintain a stranglehold on the provision of social housing and further exclude more and more proportions of society from the prospect of affordable home ownership. Local authorities still play an important role in the provision of social housing in Ireland, however they lack access to adequate resources to fulfil this function properly. As part of the introduction of any EU grants or financial instruments, local authorities should be able to directly access these funds and provided with the appropriate tools to utilise such monies. Construction costs have increased across the EU by 56% from 2010 to 2024. A significant substantial impact could come in tackling this barrier to affordable housing provision, for both public and private housing. The work of the Council should focus on sustainable, innovative methods in the construction sector to drive these costs down, such as Modern Methods of Construction and the requisite education and technical training that is required to implement such techniques."

Our road network is something that is widely recognised by Irish citizens as having been developed due to benefits accrued by our membership in the EU. Between 1994 and 1999, EU funding contributed to 61% of total expenditure on roads. When the resources of the EU are directed towards things that impact people’s lives is a positive and meaningful way, this will create a sense of ownership and pride amongst citizens. If the work of the Council can clearly contribute towards the provision of social and affordable housin, towards reframing housing as a social good and a fundamental human right, and if the actions of the EU can be seen to be challenging the interests of profit seeking speculators who seek to financialise housing markets and exclude more and more Europeans from the provision of social housing or the prospect of home ownership and housing security, then there won’t be much need to communicate the benefits and values of EU membership. It will simply become profoundly apparent in their lived experience."

However, he maintained that it is precisely during times of war that we must turn to education, learning and reason. De Valera’s Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies consisted of three schools – the School of Theoretical Physics, the School of Cosmic Physics and the School of Celtic Studies. Mr. De Valera was keen to develop knowledge of the sciences in Ireland. However, he had special reasons for including the School of Celtic Studies.

In dermatology, Ireland has already demonstrated leadership by initiating a public consultation on banning sunbeds, one of the most harmful and avoidable risk factors for skin cancer. As Europe has the highest number of UVattributable cancer cases, representing 46% of all cases worldwide, we see this thematic priority as a key opportunity to reduce such burden. EADV welcomes the Institute of Public Health’s (IPH) report on suggesting a sunbed ban to reduce skin cancer in Ireland and seeks to transfer the scientific findings into actionable policies to safeguard the public. Public health campaigns in schools promoting sun protection and sun-safe behaviours have been wellreceived, and similar preventive initiatives could be highlighted and expanded during the Presidency. The theme of prevention could also extend to measures reducing children’s exposure to harmful content, including the promotion of unrealistic beauty ideals that may encourage unsafe practices like sunbed use. Stepping up the work in preventive health is also part of the Mission that Commission President Von der Leyen assigned to the Commissioner of Health and Food Safety. Any work on prevention should include skin cancer, a largely neglected disease that poses a huge burden on Europe’s healthcare systems and economy. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council comes at an ideal time to promote stronger sunbed regulation and skin-health initiatives. Ireland is already recognised as a leader in this area, and there is growing momentum across Europe for tighter controls on sunbed use. The European Code Against Cancer outlines 14 recommendations for preventing cancer through personal behaviours and broader public-health measures. The eighth recommendation warns against excessive sun exposure and explicitly advises to “never use sunbeds”, urging policymakers to harmonise and enforce policies and recommendations on protection from exposure to UV radiation – including from sunbeds - across the EU. Furthermore, the World Health Assembly adopted in May 2025 a Resolution classifying skin diseases as a global health priority, urging governments and the international community to prioritise these conditions in their health programmes. The Irish Presidency is therefore uniquely positioned to lead the EU on skin cancer prevention (particularly regulating the use of sunbeds) and will be able to draw on international examples to limit the existence of skin cancer through sunbed use. EADV would be happy to support the Council in its work and to provide our expertise in the subject area."

However, in reality, the LVD only governs the intensity of UV in sunbeds, but not the exposure duration, which is far more relevant according to the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental, and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). The GPSR similarly cannot regulate exposure behaviour, despite the Commission arguing that the GPSR addresses all other health concerns outside of the LVD. In addition, under the LVD, the EU standard for sunbeds, EN 60335-2-27, allows a total erythemaeffective irradiance of <0.3 W/m² (made up of <0.15 W/m2 UVB and <0.15 W/m2 UVA), equivalent to an “extreme” UV index. At this intensity, unprotected skin can burn within minutes. Therefore, new legislation is necessary in the area of sunbed use in the EU to address one of the most preventable risk factors for skin cancer. It is key to note that individuals who use sunbeds have an 83% higher risk of developing skin cancer. Despite this evidence and the existence of legislation that bans sunbed use for children under 18 in Ireland, the UK, and over 20 EU Member States, many minors are still accessing sunbeds, increasing their chances of skin cancer. We would like to build on the excellence of the Irish Department of Health and continue its work on inhibiting preventable risk factors for skin cancer. In order to continue this work at the EU level and ensure that EU citizens, particularly children, are protected from skin cancer, we would advocate for the proposal of Council Conclusions on skin cancer prevention, echoing the need for a partial or full ban on sunbed use in the EU. This topic could be further addressed through a High-Level event under the patronage of the Irish Presidency, gathering representatives across the EU institutions and associations to amplify the need for a ban on sunbed use (at least for minors) across the EU. We would request additional attention towards the protection of children and young people from harmful content on social media, including material that promotes negative body image or unsafe behaviours like excessive tanning. We are pleased with the Council Conclusions for greater efforts to protect the mental health of children and teenagers in the digital era reached in June. It is essential to continue the work on protecting young people from material that promotes negative body image or unsafe behaviours such as excessive tanning. In a poll for European children from 2023, 68% felt the need to look beautiful on social media, with 51% of them feeling the need to change something about their bodies. We stand prepared to work with the Council on ensuring the protection of children and young people on social media."

Firstly, the Council’s policy work will be chief in producing the most substantial positive impact for the people and businesses of the EU, namely through its work on achieving a potential ban on sunbed usage to reduce the prevalence of skin cancer. As noted in a 2020 study on the impact of policy-based interventions, it was found that a ban on commercial indoor tanning, in combination with a public information campaign on the use of sunbeds, would result in 204,000 melanomas and 2.4 million keratinocyte carcinomas in Europe, saving EUR 21.1 billion. This policy work from the Council is the first key step in bringing the most positive results to the people of the EU. Secondly, it will be paramount to engage with stakeholders to maximise the impact of the Presidency and ensure that policies are given sufficient support. As a professional society representing leading experts in dermatology, we are eager to support any relevant initiatives the Presidency chooses to champion. With a community of more than 12,000 members across all EU Member States, and a broad network of established communication channels, we are well-positioned to amplify the visibility, reach, and effectiveness of these efforts. Additionally, Ireland has been a trailblazer in the area of sunbed regulation, and through its continued advocacy and excellence in this area, the Irish Presidency can pave the way for a Europe better protected from skin cancer."

By highlighting how EU membership and policies impact citizens’ daily lives, the Presidency can make the Union tangible and relevant. As the EU champions public health initiatives for all EU Member States, it is key to emphasise the work the Irish Council Presidency does during its term that makes a difference. We believe that due to the increasing prevalence of skin cancer diagnoses in the EU, skin cancer prevention efforts would generate an impactful outcome for those living with skin cancer and those susceptible to it. Disseminating the harmful impacts of sunbeds through digital platforms, traditional media, and public events could be combined to ensure that diverse audiences learn of the work of the Irish Presidency and feel that their concerns are represented in EU decisions. As above, we feel that engagement with stakeholder organisations such as the EADV will help to broaden the reach of Ireland’s Presidency and will allow existing networks of relevant constituents to be exploited for maximum impact."

In line with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, the Presidency should focus on priorities that strengthen social cohesion, support Europe’s long-term competitiveness and ensure that EU policies make a real difference in people’s lives, particularly for younger generations. Inclusion, Opportunity and Social Cohesion Ireland should prioritise policies that widen access to education, training and mobility opportunities and address barriers that limit participation in EU initiatives. Social, economic and regional inequalities continue to shape who is able to benefit from EU programmes in practice. Education, training and learning mobility play an important role in bringing people together, strengthening intercultural understanding and supporting democratic resilience, especially for young people and students from under-represented backgrounds. A stronger focus on inclusion helps ensure that EU education and youth policies remain fair and sustainable over time, and supports the agenda objective of strengthening democracy and social resilience. Skills, Education and EU Competitiveness The Presidency should underline the role of education, skills development and youth mobility as long-term investments in Europe’s future. Learning mobility under the Erasmus + Programme contributes to the Union of Skills by developing adaptable, multilingual and interculturally competent graduates, while also supporting their transition into the labour market and contributing to innovation and productivity across the Union. When education, employability and lifelong learning are better connected, regions are better placed to grow and benefit from the Single Market. Youth Participation and Practical Implementation Ireland should place strong emphasis on how EU policies affecting young people and learners are delivered in practice. At the same time, young people, students and civil society organisations should be actively involved in shaping and communicating EU priorities. This supports democratic participation and helps build a sense of shared ownership over EU decision-making. Consistent with the European Commission’s 2026 Work Programme focus on simplification, Ireland is well placed to champion a practical approach that improves how EU policies function on the ground. Youth-facing programmes are particularly sensitive to administrative complexity, delays and inconsistent implementation across Member States. Clearer processes, lower administrative burden and better coordination between institutions and authorities are essential if EU education and youth programmes are to work as intended. Combined, these priorities would support a Presidency that is inclusive, forward-looking and focused on practical outcomes, while helping Ireland guide the Council's work in a balanced and constructive way."

These areas are central to the work of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council and have clear links to employment and competitiveness objectives. A key priority should be the implementation of Erasmus+ and other EU education and youth programmes. While these programmes are widely recognised as successful, challenges remain in areas such as accessibility, inclusion and consistency across Member States. Europe-wide student evidence highlights challenges related to grant predictability, inclusion support, accommodation shortages and uneven recognition of learning outcomes. Addressing these issues does not require new legislative frameworks, but rather improved guidance, monitoring and coordination among institutions and national authorities, which the presidency should support. Secondly, the Presidency should support progress on recognition of learning and skills, building on existing Council Recommendations and Bologna tools. Automatic and timely recognition remains inconsistent across Member States and institutions, affecting academic progression and employability outcomes. Thirdly, Ireland’s Presidency could facilitate EU-level discussion on student accommodation and cost-of-living pressures, which increasingly affect access to education and mobility. Sharing experiences and good practice across Member States could help address common challenges. Lastly, Ireland should advance discussions on administrative simplification and digitalisation, in line with the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme. Complex and disconnected procedures can discourage participation and place unnecessary strain on institutions. The Presidency could encourage practical steps to streamline processes and improve coordination between national and institutional levels. Across these areas, the Presidency should aim to achieve practical improvements that make EU policies easier to access and more effective for those they are intended to support."

This strategic challenge should focus on connecting policy to projects and institutionalising youth voice. First, the Presidency should prioritise effective delivery and implementation of existing EU initiatives, such as the Erasmus + Programme. Many EU programmes already have strong policy foundations, but their impact depends on how well they function in practice. By promoting this, the Council can help ensure that EU policies are accessible and workable for citizens, educational institutions and civil society organizations. The Irish Presidency can leverage the Erasmus+ Programme to make the most substantial impact in this area by championing the Vocational Education and Training (VET) dimension and focusing on real-world recognition of skills acquired through mobility programmes. This can be done by: Advocating for the prioritisation and increase in volume of Key Action 1 mobility for VET learners and apprentices. Standardising recognition and certification for hidden skills gained abroad such as resilience, adaptability, cultural competence and language skills through the use of the Youthpass certification for non-formal learning and the Europass mobility document for formal learning. However, the most immediate and substantial impact Ireland’s Presidency can have on young people is by making the Erasmus+ programme accessible to those considered to be with “fewer opportunities”, as defined by the Erasmus+ regulation, by lobbying the European Commission and other Member States to simplify funding access by focussing on small-scale partnerships under Key Action 2 and encouraging the use of the ‘Exceptional Costs’ category within Key Action 1 to remove financial barriers for persons with disabilities or with socio-economic needs. Additionally, Ireland’s Presidency could lobby for the maximum allowable pre-financing of these costs prior to mobility as this is vital in tackling the financial barriers/burden associated with mobility programmes like Erasmus+ for young people coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. By strategically focusing its efforts within the Council on the financial flexibility and skills recognition mechanisms of the Erasmus+ Inclusion and Diversity Strategy, the Irish Presidency can make the Programme an unparalleled tool for promoting social inclusion and economic opportunity for the most vulnerable young people across the EU."

Utilising digital forms of media such as social media platforms to engage national/EU youth-focused organisations to shed a light on Council decision-making, policy debates and outcomes. This provides valuable transparency and accountability by meeting young people precisely where they are and by presenting the information in an accessible yet digestible format. Embedding EU values in education by promoting the integration of EU values via non-formal and informal learning outlets, such as youth work (something Ireland has a strong track record in). Elevating EU youth dialogue by hosting the final EU Youth Conference of the current Youth Dialogue cycle as the Presidency’s flagship event. This would shift the youth consultation and presentation of policy recommendations by young people from being a nicety to a compulsory step in policy design, validating young people’s expertise and giving them agency over the Presidency’s agenda. A youth check on Presidency Priorities by establishing a Youth Advisory Panel diversely compose of young people and youth workers to vet the Priorities of the Irish Presidency and the accompanying Council Conclusions. This would give young EU citizens a visible, structured role in shaping the work of the Ireland Presidency as youth-proofed. Showcasing mobility as civic action by reframing the Erasmus+ Programme and the European Solidarity Corps projects as acts of European citizenship (volunteering, cross-border cooperation, diversification of youth engagement) as opposed to travel/study/work opportunities. Ireland’s existing strengths in youth work as managed by the National Youth Council of Ireland and its commitment to the EU Youth Strategy, position it perfectly for this Presidency to lead by example. A highly appropriate response to this would be to use the Presidency to institutionalise youth voice, turning policy consultation into genuine policy input and demonstrating that the Council’s work is directly influenced by its young citizens."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefitsharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
413,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/84c67ba2/National_Biogas_Concern_Group_Ireland_-_Submission_413.docx,National Biogas Concern Group Ireland,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “peoplecentred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, communityled projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
413,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/84c67ba2/National_Biogas_Concern_Group_Ireland_-_Submission_413.docx,National Biogas Concern Group Ireland,,,,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agriinvestors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industryspecific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

As Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026, there is a significant opportunity to elevate physical activity as a strategic policy priority across EU institutions and Member States. Doing so would align with Ireland’s national strengths in sport, community engagement, and public health promotion, while contributing to EU-wide ambitions for healthier, more inclusive societies. As a policy priority, there are cross-sectional benefits to physical activity; Future proofing public health – promoting preventative healthcare, physical activity, physical literacy, and active living has both physical and mental health benefits. Strengthening communities – across Europe there are many communities that have insufficient access to physical activity facilities, amenities, active travel opportunities. Through its Presidency of the Council, Ireland can play a leading role in coordinating best practice in this area among member states to address this lack of opportunities and focus. Basis for inclusion as a policy priority: Despite decades of research and public campaigns, one-third of EU citizens do not meet recommended physical activity levels, and 45% report never engaging in sport or exercise. This widespread inactivity negatively impacts individual health, creates long-term pressure on healthcare systems, and undermines social cohesion. Inactivity is influenced by complex factors, including limited access to facilities, socioeconomic barriers, gender disparities, and health-related constraints. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated, cross-sectoral action across health, education, transport, urban planning, and social policy."

Primark recommends the following high-level priorities that reflect the EU Strategic Agenda, Ireland’s consultation framing, and the needs of businesses and citizens across the Union. 1. A Competitive and Integrated Single Market Ireland should champion policies that enhance Europe’s competitiveness, reduce administrative complexity through harmonisation of interpretation and implementation of regulation across the EU, and support innovation and investment. A focus on regulatory coherence, simplification and digitalisation (objectives outlined in this consultation overview) will support Europe’s retail sector, improve productivity and preserve affordability for consumers. This aligns with Primark’s emphasis on a predictable, proportionate regulatory environment that enables physical retail and digital businesses to operate on a level playing field. 2. A Coherent, Practical and Ambitious Transition to a Circular Economy Ireland is uniquely positioned to lead discussions on the Circular Economy Act and the Environmental Omnibus Package. Primark supports an approach that balances ambition with feasibility, ensuring EU-wide harmonisation in areas such as eco-modulation, waste definitions and end-of-waste criteria. Specifically, we expect a deeper revision of the EPR in line with the Environmental Omnibus plans. In addition, the integration of the SCIP provisions into the Digital Product Passport requires sensible implementation. A harmonised framework will advance circularity while lowering administrative burden and supporting affordable access to more sustainable products. Strengthening EU-wide durability requirements is also critical, and Primark is committed to contributing to solutions that extend product lifespans while supporting a competitive and affordable single market. 3. A People-Centred Europe Supporting Affordability and Inclusion As an Irish-founded international retailer, Primark strongly supports an EU that protects and promotes jobs, recognising retail’s role as the largest private sector employer in the EU economy, strengthens community life across urban and rural areas, and maintains access to affordable, more sustainable products. This aligns with the consultation’s emphasis on an inclusive, future-oriented vision for the Union and should be a thematic focus of the Presidency."
289,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/78be283f/Primark_-_Submission_289.docx,Primark,Private business,Retail,EU-wide,2,"Ireland’s Presidency will coincide with negotiations on key sustainability and competitiveness files. Primark recommends a consultative approach with industry and adequate timelines for any new requirements, with the Presidency prioritising the following: 1. Circular Economy Act (CEA) The CEA is central to Europe’s transition to circularity. Ireland should aim to secure: EU-wide harmonisation of EPR and PRO rules, including a digital one-stop-shop to simplify reporting and reduce duplication. Aligned eco-modulation criteria across ESPR, WFD and packaging rules to ensure consistency. EU-wide end-of-waste criteria and clarified waste-ownership rules, enabling cross-border reuse, recycling and innovation. Proportionate, phased transition timelines to support investment and maintain affordability. 2. Environmental Omnibus Package & ESPR Delegated Acts Ireland should promote coherence across interlinked legislation to avoid conflicting requirements and unnecessary administrative burdens. Key aims should include: Ensuring product durability, recyclability and recycled content requirements reflect technical feasibility, material availability and do not compromise affordability. Alignment between Digital Product Passport rules, SCIP provisions, textile labelling and related data requirements, preventing duplication. 3. A Stronger, Fairer Single Market for Retail and Consumers Ireland should support measures that ensure balanced competition between physical and digital retailers. As highlighted in Presidency planning, traditional retailers are often disproportionately affected by fragmented compliance obligations across a wide range of areas compared to some online entrants. Simplification and harmonisation are critical to maintaining a fair and competitive marketplace. 4. Investment in Circular Infrastructure The Presidency should promote EU and global investment in textile-to-textile recycling, sorting capacity and circular supply chain development, acknowledging that circularity is a global value chain requiring EU and non-EU cooperation. The Just Transition should be considered. 5. Coherence in Consumer Information and Environmental Claims Ireland should champion an EU-wide, harmonised approach to environmental claims to avoid fragmentation and multiple advertising regimes to comply with whilst strengthening consumer trust."

Reduce administrative burden and support affordability Harmonised reporting systems, coherent definitions and aligned timelines will reduce compliance costs and help ensure that products remain affordable. The EU Commission has already stated that it has a goal of making business easier and faster in Europe. The Irish Presidency can deliver on that goal. 2. Support jobs, communities and shopping destinations Retail is the EU’s largest private sector employer, providing jobs for nearly 30 million people, and is a key contributor to community vitality. Primark’s footprint across Europe demonstrates the positive economic and social impact of physical retail. A balanced regulatory framework and level playing field will help safeguard employment and revitalise high street and shopping districts across the EU. 3. Enable citizens to participate in the circular economy Clear, consistent rules on product design, waste handling and sustainability information will make it easier for citizens to engage in reuse and recycling initiatives. Improved infrastructure, supported through EPR revenues and EU investment, will deliver visible, local benefits. 4. Provide regulatory predictability that drives innovation Businesses need stable, coherent rules to invest in new materials, recycling solutions and circular business models. A Presidency agenda that emphasises proportionality and synchronisation will unlock innovation across the Single Market. 5. Ensure the sustainability transition is inclusive The Presidency should continue emphasising that sustainability and affordability must move in parallel, so that all households can access more sustainable products. This principle is central to Primark’s business model and its sustainability strategy, Primark Cares."

Highlight everyday benefits of EU membership Ireland should communicate how EU legislation improves lives through strong consumer protection, environmental standards, workers’ rights and access to affordable products. These are all themes that, if communicated effectively, will be widely understood by citizens. 2. Showcase Irish leadership in sustainability and innovation The Government intends to highlight leading Irish businesses during the Presidency, including those contributing to Europe’s circular transition. Primark’s sustainability commitments and its progress against these, shown in its latest Sustainability & Ethics report and forthcoming EU Textile Transition Pathway pledges provide credible examples of Irish-led sustainability progress. 3. Connect sustainability with fairness and affordability Communications should reflect citizens’ concerns about cost-of-living pressures. A Presidency narrative that emphasises fairness, inclusivity and a just transition will resonate strongly across Europe. 4. Transparency and participation Open consultations, public-facing Presidency events and transparent communication on Presidency milestones will help citizens understand and feel part of Ireland’s EU leadership role. Clear explanations of how EU decisions influence everyday issues—such as consumer protections, product safety, environmental standards, digital rights and the affordability of essential goods—can make the Presidency’s work more relevant and accessible. Demonstrating these concrete benefits, alongside opportunities for direct engagement, will strengthen public confidence in EU policymaking and reinforce the value of Ireland’s contribution to shaping outcomes that impact people’s daily lives."

We believe the Presidency can play a pivotal role in shaping a regulatory environment that supports innovation, strengthens the Single Market and makes the transition to a circular economy both practical and affordable for citizens. As the EU advances legislation to support the transition to a circular economy, Ireland is well placed to promote an approach centred on harmonisation, proportionality and coherence across the regulatory landscape. Primark strongly supports efforts to simplify compliance, align definitions and timelines, and promote digital tools that reduce administrative burden. Such measures are essential to ensuring that sustainability and environmental ambitions are delivered in a way that strengthens competitiveness, facilitates investment and protects consumer affordability. We also encourage the Presidency to highlight the importance of well-designed EPR systems and circular infrastructure that can operate effectively across borders. Harmonised reporting, clear end-of-waste criteria, and transparent governance structures will be critical enablers of a functioning circular economy. Investment in sorting, recycling and reuse capacity will help unlock real progress and give citizens meaningful ways to participate in circularity. Ireland’s Presidency offers a unique opportunity to showcase the contribution of Irish businesses to the European economy, including companies committed to advancing sustainability while maintaining affordability. Primark is proud of its Irish heritage and of its role supporting employment, shopping destinations and communities across the EU. We believe the Presidency can amplify positive examples of industry leadership that align with EU values and demonstrate how competitiveness, sustainability and inclusion can reinforce one another. In this context, Primark encourages the Government to champion a narrative that balances environmental ambition with economic resilience and social impact. A Presidency focus on practical, implementable regulation, on strengthening the Single Market, and on ensuring the green transition is fair and accessible will deliver benefits for people, businesses and communities across Europe. Primark stands ready to support the Government before and during the Presidency period, including by sharing insights from across the retail and textile sectors, participating in relevant stakeholder discussions and events, and contributing to initiatives that advance circularity and consumer awareness. In fact, we hope to be involved in at least one associated event around the Presidency and will be in contact with the relevant Government Department once there is greater clarity on event formation. We look forward to working collaboratively to help Ireland deliver a successful and impactful Presidency that reflects the values and interests of the Union and its citizens."

Given the timing of the Irish Presidency and the Council objective of concluding specific negotiations by the end of 2026. It is likely that Ireland will conclude negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework and Common Agricultural Policy which gives further importance to placing agriculture at the very center of the Presidency Priorities, and specifically an increased budget allocation for all genuine active farmers. A Profitable European Agriculture Sector: Agriculture across the EU faces significant challenges which have been further compounded following the COVID-19 crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Market volatility for both output and input prices have become commonplace which has made the sector more unstable. There is a sustained focus and necessity to attract young people into the farming sector and how to make farming more attractive in the EU. There is a lack of understanding on areas like the current costs of running a farming enterprise, the cost of compliance and how this has impacts on viability, attracting younger people into the sector and stabilizing incomes. If the EU Institutions are serious about the future of farming in Europe, making the sector attractive via fair and stable incomes should be central to this. Similarly, continually raiding CAP for environmental ambition will not promote greater economic nor social sustainability. New, independent money is needed. CAP should be for farmers and food production. Environmental action, including that of NRL obligations, should be funded elsewhere. A Fair Global Trading Environment: Global Trade has also become increasingly volatile in recent years stemming from significant geopolitical events which continue to shape and change how agricultural goods are traded. Ireland is a highly export oriented country especially in terms of meat and dairy. Our products are internationally recognized for their quality, traceability and commitments to high levels of animal welfare. The same standards do not apply globally and Irish and EU produce face increasing competition from produce that is not produced to the same EU phytosanitary and welfare standards. As stated in the Vision for Agriculture and Food – The EU must investigate further how it can prevent products which are not produced to the same standards from entering the EU Food Chain. This must encompass a central tenet to the success / progression of current and future EU trade agreements. True Simplification and Better Regulation: There is a significant push towards simplification in the current EU Commission spanning all sectors of the economy, yet farmers across the EU still contend with disproportionate levels of bureaucracy and incoherent legislation from the previous EU mandate that is not conducive to the effort to achieve a more competitive EU Agriculture Sector. There must be an absolute commitment to simplifying the implementation of EU laws for farmers directly on the ground. Equally the EU must move towards a more coherent system for proposing any new directives and regulations which are pragmatic and considerate of realities on the ground. There are too many examples of laws which have been proposed by the Commission which are eventually discovered to be unimplementable and not conducive to running a business competitively in the EU. Agriculture must be a centrally involved in the Communication on Better Regulation expected in 2026."

The new governance structure of the CAP represents a dilution of stakeholder input into the CAP and does not promote simplification. This proposal is hugely concerning for Irish farmers with up to 75% of family farm income in vulnerable sectors derived from Direct Payments in 2023/24. The proposal represents the potential loss of a ringfenced CAP fund and has completely eroded the Pillar 2 element focusing on infrastructure and Agri-environment schemes. This CAP proposal also has the potential to impose added liability to National Governments in terms of governance. The lack of ringfencing leaves the policy vulnerable to government change and thus the types of supports that farmers may receive. This offers little room for long term planning and has the potential to result in disjointed schemes and infrastructure commitments, neither of which are conducive to environmental improvement. It is imperative that under the Irish presidency, the government garners support for further ringfencing and significant increases in the commitments in the NRPPs surrounding agricultural productivity and food production for the benefit of all genuine active farmers. Amending EC Regulation 1/2005 on Live Animal Transport (Proposed) Ireland’s location as an island nation on the western fringes of the European Union must be considered when potentially revising the live Animal Transport regulation with key consideration given to the length of allowable journey times to ensure the continuity of trade between Ireland and EU member states and Ireland and third countries as well as the age of calves on when they can be first transported. An electrolyte feed as an alternative to milk replacers during transport must also be considered due to inconsistencies in the composition of different milk replacers and nutritional upsets in calves will increase if only protein-based feeds are used in transport. Ireland is a leader of best practice in terms of animal transport and has implemented both the current Regulation 1/2005 and additional measures beyond the current legislation to ensure good animal welfare during transport. Consideration of this must be given in any further revisions which could cause a disproportionate economic burden to Irish farmers. Full access and continuation of third country exports must also be assured given their economic importance to livestock producers and role as a competitive, fair and functioning market for Irish farmers. Ireland has demonstrated its commitment to safe third country exports via additional monitoring measures and reporting during transport, often being the only EU member state to do so. Unfair Trading Practices (Update of rules on unfair trading practices in the food chain (legislative, Article 43 TFEU, Q3 2026) A proposal on the revision of the UTP legislation is likely to be negotiated under the Irish Presidency. Under this revision, there should be greater powers given to the national competent authorities which enforce the UTPs. The EU should pay closer attention to the price returns occurring across food supply chains and aim for the greatest levels of transparency and fairness to be incorporated into agri-food supply chains particularly for those in the domestic retail market. Livestock strategy including elements on animal welfare (Q2 2026) Ireland is specifically well placed to contribute significantly to the future proposal of an EU Livestock Strategy. Irelands agriculture model is unique to the context of European Agriculture given that is predominantly grass based and livestock focused. Ireland is a leader in terms of progressive livestock farming with extensive research and extension services which could be a model to other member states in terms of livestock policy. The livestock strategy should promote animal farming and as stated in the vision recognise that ‘no one size fits all’ when it comes to livestock production in the EU."

It would be important that the benefits that come with hosting the presidency are not confined to purely to urban centers, but instead in locations where EU Legislation / proposals may have greatest impact (e.g. NRL and Western regions). This can serve as an example to other member states that rural communities should not be alienated by the EU and that it is listening and engaging with the issues that are affecting rural people across the EU. Other previous presidencies have shown the value of hosting presidency events outside of Capital cities, the Polish presidency utilized Gdansk and Poznan while the Belgian presidency regularly hosted events in Ghent. EU support is most visible in the Irish countryside with rural development projects in most communities and the impact of the CAP is visible in almost every farm yard in Ireland. The importance that this investment has had on Ireland cannot be underestimated and at a time when the CAP is coming under financial pressure from budget cuts, it should be displayed widely the impact that EU funding has had on modernizing the landscape of Irish Agriculture. Recognizing this rural demography, of which farming plays an important role in supporting, the Irish Presidency should place focus on policies which have significant socio-economic impacts for rural people, businesses, and communities. Ireland is distinctly unique in terms of its geographical location, climate, and agriculture model more broadly. An example of this being that more than 90% of Ireland’s agricultural area is covered by grasslands which is drastically more than the EU average. Equally Ireland has a distinctly high percentage of peatland soils which are important in the context of EU climate policy. The Government should take this opportunity to demonstrate Irelands unique characteristics to other EU delegations during the Presidency so they can understand Ireland better when it comes to future EU policy making. This will have benefits for rural people, businesses, and communities if other EU countries can understand Ireland more accurately moving forward. Farm visits should be incorporated into agriculture focused visits especially in July and September when weather is favorable."

The EU legislative process and institutions themselves are complex and the government should try to increase general literacy of the European Union in the lead up to the Presidency. This can help people understand more what competencies the EU has and how it impacts them more directly, this can in turn help with creating a positive light around the presidency. In an agricultural context, communicating the development journey and transformation that Ireland has come on since joining the EU in 1973 would be valuable. While this has overwhelmingly been a positive journey and farmers appreciate the significant impact that EU has had on Ireland, there have also been challenging times for both Irish and EU agriculture including the BSE crisis and various CAP reforms. Highlighting this journey through events and agricultural media would be important."
344,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/1da3f3e8/European_Cancer_Organisation_-_Submission_344.docx,,"Response on behalf of the European Cancer Organisation, a not-for-profit umbrella organisation.",Public Health,Europe focus.,1,"ECO recommends that the Irish Presidency of the EU include in its high level thematic priorities: the preservation and enhancement of the European Health Union. In Ireland, 44,000 citizens are diagnosed with cancer every year, and 9,800 people die from the disease, making cancer the most common cause of death. This places a devastating burden on the Irish society and its healthcare system, with annual spending on cancer care reaching €1.14 billion and indirect costs amounting to €639 million. In recent years, the development and delivery of targeted policies have shown real impact in easing this burden. Notable examples include the EU Cancer Mission on cancer and Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, yet also Ireland’s National Cancer Strategy for 2017–2026. These had a concrete impact on Ireland, through: With a rate of 7%, Ireland has the lowest rate of smoking among 15-year-olds in the EU, making it an example of how to implement the EU's Beating Cancer Plan, aiming to create a tobacco-free generation by 2040. Reaching out an 83% immunisation rate for HPV vaccination in 2022, close to the EU target of eliminating cervical cancer by 2040 through gender-neutral vaccination (WHO). Introducing a Central Bank (Amendment) Bill in February 2025 to prohibit financial service providers from discriminating against survivors of cancer from accessing financial services, paving the way for a stronger Right to be Forgotten. This underscores the strategic value of a coordinated approach, with EU and national initiatives reinforcing one another. Keeping health and cancer care high on the political agenda in Ireland and across the EU is therefore essential to sustaining momentum and addressing the enduring challenges at both levels. Without strengthened screening, prevention, and treatment pathways, Ireland risks facing an additional 15,000 new cancer cases every year by 2040, along with a continued increase in cancer deaths ; According to OECD, in 2022, more than half of adults in Ireland were either overweight or obese; Ireland’s breast-cancer screening programme has missed its targets for the past two years, with a target of 195,000 women in 2024, yet only 137,134 were screened. Despite this urge, the European Commission appears to be shifting health policy further into the frame of broader “competitiveness” priorities in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2028-2034. Under the proposed Commission architecture, the EU4Health Programme would be discontinued, eliminating the EU’s dedicated funding stream for health and cancer-specific initiatives. Instead, health is set to be incorporated into a wider Competitiveness Fund, under ""health, biotech, agriculture and bioeconomy"" heading. This merger risks diluting cancer-focused initiatives, as the overlap between these diverse policy areas may reduce their visibility and impact. In setting its high-level thematic priorities for its 2026 Presidency of the Council, Ireland should place cancer and health at the centre of its programming priorities. Building on its reputation as a cancer champion, Ireland is uniquely positioned to lead by example, setting high standards for other EU Member States. Strong and visible leadership is essential to ensure that health and cancer care remain prominent on the political agenda, both in overarching policy priorities and in the negotiations for the next Multiannual Financial Framework."

The Presidency can play a pivotal role in the following areas: 1. Advancing Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2028–2034 negotiations With EU4Health no longer operating as a dedicated health instrument, cancer-related actions risk being absorbed into wide, catch-all funding envelopes in the next MFF 2028-2034. This makes it harder to guarantee that cancer priorities receive the targeted, ring-fenced investment needed to sustain progress. ECO calls on the Presidency to: Champion a €2 billion European Cancer Fund within the Competitiveness Fund to guarantee full implementation of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan and ensure cancer is not marginalised within wider “Health, Biotech, Resilience and Bioeconomy” agendas. Strengthen the cancer relevance of National and Regional Partnership Plans (NRPPs) by raising the share for social objectives to 20%, enabling investment in national cancer screening, vaccination infrastructure, oncology workforce capacity and modern cancer-data systems. Secure the continuation of the Cancer Mission as a future Horizon Europe “moonshot” and support consideration of a European Cancer Institute to coordinate EU-wide cancer research and innovation. Calling for stronger and harmonised tobacco control policies Tobacco is a leading cause of preventable death in the EU, claiming over 700,000 lives annually and accounting for 27% of all cancer cases. The Presidency should push for the following measures: Advancing the revision of the Tobacco Taxation Directive and Tobacco Products Directive, ensuring higher and more consistent excise duties across all tobacco and nicotine products, including novel products that disproportionately attract young people; Facilitate agreement on New Own Resources, particularly the Tobacco Excise Duty Own Resource, generating sustainable revenue while reinforcing cancer and health prevention objectives. Showcasing Irish position on Alcohol policies Europe has the highest level of alcohol drinking globally. 7 of the top 10 countries with the highest alcohol consumption are in the EU, where approximately 240,000 people died because of alcohol in 2019. The Irish Government’s pioneering move to introduce legislation on alcohol labelling marked an important first step towards a healthier Europe. However, the subsequent announced delay to the measures being introduced cited, among other reasons, a need for European alignment on alcohol labelling. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritise the following measures: Support greater consensus between EU member states on achieving health warnings on alcohol labelling across Europe – as was promised in Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan Within this, ensure consumers rights are upheld by mandating inclusion of a full list of all ingredients in all alcoholic beverages 3. Pushing for cancer to be integrated in the upcoming Gender Equality Strategy The forthcoming EU Gender Equality Strategy, expected for adoption in March 2026, will come before the Irish Presidency at first reading, giving Ireland a critical opportunity to reinforce the ambition and clarity of the text. The Strategy identifies health as a guiding principle; an approach ECO strongly welcomes. Yet to be truly effective, it must explicitly embed a holistic understanding of health, ensuring that gender-related disparities across cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship are fully addressed. You may read more on ECO’s 5 Women Cancer Rights here: https://europeancancer.org/resources/news/press-release-introducing-five-basic-cancer-rights-for-women-at-the-european-parliament.html 4. Pushing for cancer to be integrated in other equality frameworks The Irish Presidency has an opportunity to make cancer a clearer priority across EU equality initiatives. By embedding cancer considerations within work on intergenerational fairness, anti-poverty measures and the emerging European Housing Strategy, the Presidency can help ensure that social and environmental determinants, such as age-relate vulnerability, income inequality and poor housing conditions, are addressed in a coherent way. This would strengthen the Union’s wider equality agenda while supporting more effective cancer prevention and protection for those most at risk."

It could notably support elevating cancer as a strategic EU priority during the MFF 2028–2034 negotiations, ensuring it is addressed with dedicated focus rather than subsumed under broader competitiveness considerations. By providing the cancer community with a structured platform to contribute expertise, facilitating the exchange of best practices, and fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration, such an event would and drives actionable measures that improve outcomes for patients and communities across Europe. Such an event could also focus on areas where Ireland has demonstrated leadership, such as policies on alcohol and tobacco control, showcasing best-practice approaches that can be adopted across the EU. In parallel, an event hosted by the cancer community under the auspices of the Irish Presidency would offer a distinct but complementary space to elevate patient voices on distinct topics, highlight innovative initiatives and EU-funded projects for instance lead by Ireland, and foster collaboration across sectors. By demonstrating that the community is prepared to contribute expertise, this event can strengthen stakeholder engagement, bringing together healthcare professionals, researchers, patient organisations, and industry representatives in a more flexible, action-oriented setting.

To demonstrate the value of EU membership and foster citizen ownership of Ireland’s Presidency, emphasis should be placed on concrete achievements. Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan illustrates how EU coordination enhances cancer prevention, treatment, and research, Ireland has for example benefited from increased investment in cancer prevention, treatment, and research, strengthening the healthcare system and improving outcomes for patients across the country. From 1973 up to 2018 Ireland was a net recipient of over €40 billion in EU funds; The European Health Data Space (EHDS) supports Ireland’s use of health and cancer data, with €3.6 million funding to establish a national Health Data Access Body for research and personalised care. The upcoming Irish Presidency, therefore, provides an opportunity to ensure that health and cancer care remain a central theme of the Irish Presidency, mirroring the Irish population’s key asks. The Irish Presidency could, for example, showcase how policy actions developed by Irish civil society, such as the National Cancer Information System (NCIS), which ensures that 16 of 26 chemotherapy-providing hospitals in Ireland can work together , the new radiation oncology centre in Galway, which has driven improvements in treatment and after-care for cancer patients, and the €95 million spent on anti-smoking initiatives since 2017, could contribute to the successful implementation of the EU's Beating Cancer Plan across Member States. By doing so, benefit will be provided not only to Irish cancer patients, healthcare professionals and researchers through increased investment in cancer care, but also to Irish society as a whole by addressing the indirect costs of cancer on Irish society."

The organisation is also a member of ILGA-Europe — the European Region of the International Lesbian,",1,"A theme of inclusion and equality should form one of the high-level priorities for Ireland’s Presidency of the Council in 2026. The Commission Work Programme 2026 positions itself as “a pitch for unity, a programme for delivery and a plan for togetherness and an independent Europe”. In the face of fragmenting forces, Ireland’s role offers an opportunity to demonstrate the inseparability of inclusion and a stable, thriving Union. This choice directly supports the work programme’s priorities of: “Supporting people and strengthening Europe’s social model”; and “Upholding democracy, the rule of law and protecting our values.” It also supports the Strategic Agenda 2024–29 priorities of: “Upholding European values within the Union”; and “Living up to our values at global level.” Within this theme, LGBTQ+ inclusion must feature as a high-level priority. Recent findings from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) indicate a significant rise in hate-motivated harassment across the EU. The European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) published its Sixth report on Ireland in 2025, which flagged a number of areas of concern related to LGBTQ+ communities, including mental health, hate speech, conversion practices, school inclusion, and nonconsensual medical interventions performed on intersex children. At the same time, rising authoritarian movements seek to undermine human rights, and weaponise LGBTQ+ communities in pursuit of this goal. As the EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30 notes: [A] recent OECD study refers to annual GDP losses in the EU associated with discrimination based on sexual orientation of up to EUR 89 million. The same study highlights that the impact of discrimination extends beyond the economy. It undermines social cohesion, weakens civic trust and erodes support for democratic values. Inclusive societies are more resilient, marked by greater solidarity, stronger institutions and higher levels of civic participation. (4) Responding in solidarity with those communities most affected demonstrates a commitment to the safety and full participation of all EU citizens, and reflects an active pursuit of social cohesion. Youth participation and inclusion must also feature prominently within this theme. The National Youth Council of Ireland’s recent Connecting EU with Youth report found that “young people's sense of belonging is tied to feeling safe, included, and empowered” (5), and that they are experiencing “a ‘loss of hope’ due to the perceived erosion of core EU values” (24). At the same time, they “find official EU language to be overcomplicated and express scepticism about the implementation of recommendations from consultation processes” (5). To sustain youth support for the EU now and into the future, Ireland’s Presidency of the Council must build in a significant theme of youth engagement and empowerment, including LGBTQ+ youth."

Given civil society concerns that the new strategy falls behind the ambitions of its predecessor, its credibility must be demonstrated through decisive Council action and political commitment. Ending Conversion Practices The Presidency must support the Commission to enable Member states to end so-called “conversion practices”, or efforts to change or suppress an LGBTIQ+ person's identity. Aims: Drive forward commitments in the EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30, supporting engagement in structured dialogue and enabling Member states to combat conversion practices at a national level. EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30 commitments: Promote structured dialogue on the topic, in particular through the expert group on LGBTIQ+ equality, under the High-Level Group on non-discrimination, equality, and diversity. Based on the study’s findings, the Commission will take appropriate action to combat conversion practices, with a particular focus on supporting Member states, who play a critical role in this area. Harmonising hate offences across the EU The Union's response to hate offences is currently inconsistent. Ireland must focus on advancing initiatives to harmonise the definition of these crimes across the EU, specifically targeting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Aims: Ensure support for and engagement with the Commission in implementing the EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30 commitments around tackling hate. Additionally, use harmonised definitions of hate crime to facilitate the stronger enforcement of the Digital Services Act (DSA) against anti-LGBTIQ+ hate speech and harassment online. EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30 commitments: • A legislative initiative based on the existing areas of crime covered by Article 83(1) of TFEU to harmonise the definition of hate offences committed online. 4. Implementing legal gender recognition across EU states Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) delivered his Opinion in the Shipov case in September, stating that member states have an obligation to legally recognise the lived gender of their nationals. The Presidency should use the momentum provided by the CJEU to further enable member states to legally recognise the lived gender of their nationals under EU law. Aims: Ensure support for and engagement with the Commission in implementing the Equality Strategy commitments around tackling hate. EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy 2026–30 commitments: Facilitate exchanges of best practices among member states to support the development of legal gender recognition procedures based on self-determination that are free from age restrictions."

We recommend that a high-profile event is held to recognise and celebrate these milestones of progress.

As the representative body for more than 1,000 businesses across the Greater Dublin Area, we engage daily with companies navigating both the opportunities and the pressures of operating within the EU Single Market. Ireland’s EU Presidency comes at a time of heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and it presents a significant opportunity for this country to advance a more competitive, cohesive and resilient Europe, all while improving conditions for domestic enterprise. Informed by feedback from our members and the wider Chamber network, we believe that Ireland’s priorities for the Presidency should focus on enhancing competitiveness, strengthening the Single Market, creating a more efficient regulatory environment, and advancing key climate and energy objectives. Dublin’s business community emphasises the importance of consolidation over reinvention during this Presidency, and positioning Europe as an outward-looking, innovative and attractive destination to do business and invest. For Dublin businesses, strengthening and streamlining the EU Single Market should be the foremost priority for Ireland’s Presidency. Central to this is the creation of a more workable and coherent regulatory system. Members across all sizes and sectors continue to report that regulatory fragmentation coming from Brussels and rising administrative burdens are undermining competitiveness. Overly complex rules and excessive reporting obligations must be simplified and reduced if the Single Market is to remain competitive and become better integrated. The EU’s ambition to reduce administrative burdens by at least 25% for businesses and 35% for SMEs has been strongly welcomed by firms across the region. Ireland must act as a leader during its Presidency to drive progress towards these commitments and embed burden reduction across future legislative and reporting frameworks. With the EU having already commenced its rollout of the Competitiveness Compass and presented the Omnibus simplification packages, members urge the Government to drive the agenda forward during its Presidency. Ireland should champion the full implementation of the Draghi Report and ensure meaningful progress on forthcoming simplification measures. Energy security and decarbonisation are equally pressing priorities. Our members have noted several important forthcoming initiatives, including the European Grids Package, revisions to the TEN-E Regulation and the EU Action Plan on Affordable Energy, as critical to both climate delivery and economic resilience. For Ireland, advancing these files during its Presidency will be essential not only for meeting emissions targets but also for maintaining competitiveness. Modernising grid infrastructure, accelerating and simplifying permitting, and coordinating EU action on energy affordability should be central priorities for the next EU cycle. Ireland can also use its Presidency to demonstrate national leadership in effectively implementing the green transition, while supporting the adoption of the Environmental Omnibus to simplify environmental requirements for businesses. Maintaining a balanced and innovation-friendly approach to digitalisation is another key priority. Firms have highlighted that the cumulative impact of new EU legislation, from the Digital Services Act to the AI Act, has increased compliance complexity at a time when many organisations are still navigating the digital transition. Ireland’s Presidency should therefore prioritise coherent and practical implementation of these frameworks, promote innovation-enabling tools such as regulatory sandboxes, and position itself as a leader in AI skills development. The proposed Digital Omnibus simplification package also offers a timely opportunity to streamline and better align existing rules. Ensuring its swift adoption, including amendments across the General Data Protection Regulation, Data Act, cybersecurity rules, and parts of the AI Act during trilogue under the Irish Presidency, should be a priority of the Irish Presidency."

With several major EU files set to reach decisive stages next year, including in taxation, digital regulation, climate and energy policy, and competitiveness reforms, Ireland’s Presidency will play a pivotal role in shaping their final direction. The focus should be on advancing well-developed, strategically important proposals rather than launching new initiatives that may ultimately be reshaped by subsequent Presidencies. One such strategic area of focus should be access to finance and capital. Members have identified Europe’s underdeveloped investment landscape, particularly in relation to savings mobilisation, SME finance and fragmented cross-border capital markets, as a structural drag on competitiveness. The need to diversify funding opportunities for businesses and ensure free movement of capital across the EU is reflected strongly across our members’ priorities. Progress on the EU’s three unions - the Savings and Investments Union, the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union - is therefore urgent. Ireland will be well placed during its Presidency to advance the Banking Union and Capital Markets Union, all while coordinating Member States to mobilise private investments toward a European Savings and Investments Union. Ensuring a coherent approach to taxation policy is another area of critical importance for firms. They have highlighted the forthcoming revision of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in 2026, noting that both files are technically demanding and politically sensitive. Given the requirement for unanimity, Ireland should seek to ensure adequate Council time for meaningful negotiation while also promoting stability, certainty, and simplicity in corporate taxation, elements essential to the predictability of the Irish business environment. Beyond simplifying regulation, inconsistent implementation and gold-plating of EU directives remain key drivers of fragmentation - an issue of particular concern for Irish businesses. EU Directives drafted for civil-law systems often contain broad or subjective terminology that creates challenges when transposed into Ireland’s commonlaw system. Our members cited Ireland’s experience with Environmental Impact Assessments, where ambiguous terms such as “appropriate” have contributed to extensive documentation requirements, heightened litigation risk, and delays to critical infrastructure. Ireland’s Presidency presents an opportunity to advocate for more precise EU legislative drafting, better adapted to diverse legal systems, and for transposition practices that enhance legal certainty and reduce unnecessary litigation."

This includes allowing sufficient time for complex fiscal and technical files, facilitating constructive dialogue among Member States, and ensuring that decisions are grounded in robust evidence and policy analysis. Strengthening cooperation between national regulators will also help improve regulatory coherence and reduce fragmentation. Ireland should also ensure that the perspective of SMEs remains at the forefront of Council negotiations. SMEs make up the vast majority of Ireland and Europe’s business landscape and can too often be disproportionately affected by complex or fragmented regulation. Applying clear SME-impact assessments across legislative files will help ensure that proposals do not create unnecessary burdens and remain practical for businesses both large and small. By embedding this approach throughout the Presidency’s work, Ireland can support more effective, proportionate policymaking that strengthens competitiveness and delivers meaningful benefits for businesses of all sizes across the EU."

Climate change must be the top priority for Ireland’s Presidency of the Council. The climate crisis is not a distant challenge, it is our current, shared reality. 2024 was the warmest year on record worldwide with an average global surface temperature of 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels (World Meteorological Organisation, 2025). Closely interlinked with the global biodiversity crisis, human-driven climate change has severe social, ecological, and economic implications. These impacts are far-reaching and disproportionate, having the largest impacts on the communities that have contributed the least to this crisis. To address this complex crisis, we have nationally enshrined legislation (such as Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021) and internationally agreed obligations established through the processes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Whilst some action has been taken, we are still significantly off-track in terms of reducing global emissions and reducing anthropocentric impacts on the environment in Ireland, Europe, and internationally. The UN Emissions Gap Report 2024 stated that ‘we would need global mobilization on a scale and pace never seen before’, without which the critical Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels ‘will be dead within a few years and 2°C will take its place in the intensive care unit’ (UN, 2024: XI). We are at a critical point in history and we must take immediate and radical action to reduce the biggest contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission - fossil fuels. Therefore, it is vital that Ireland uses its Presidency to place the climate crisis high up on the EU’s agenda to achieve urgently needed climate action."

Some European governments and the fossil fuel industry are pushing to build Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals which will lock us into decades of polluting gas consumption, increase reliance on imported energy, and obstruct investment in clean local energy, delaying the urgent transition towards a zero carbon future. . Increasingly, leaders on global climate policy are calling for a rapid move away from all fossil fuels, including natural gas. There is currently excess LNG in the EU supply chain, with TotalEnergies’ terminal in Le Havre being demobilised due to lack of demand (TotalEnergies.com, 2025). Yet, there has been a recent proliferation of LNG in Europe, with several proposed projects in Ireland. With an even greater greenhouse gas footprint than conventional gas, and 20% higher lifecycle emissions than coal (Howarth, 2024), ending the use of LNG should be a global priority. LNG as an interim energy source requires massive infrastructure expenditures, for ships and liquefaction plants and the pipelines that supply them. Instead, redoubling efforts to ramp up the green economy as fast as possible can yield energy security, along with more jobs than fossil fuel investments (World Economic Forum, 2021). In July 2020, then Vice President of the European Investment Bank stated that ‘investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure like LNG terminals is increasingly an economically unsound decision’ (Reuters, 2020a). On a project-by-project basis, clean energy portfolios - optimised combinations of demand-side management and wind, solar, and storage technologies - are cheaper than 90% of proposed gas-fired power units (Teplin et al. 2019). There is precedent for LNG opposition in Europe: LNG projects have faced opposition and delays as governments recognised that they are incompatible with climate targets. In 2019, the Swedish government withdrew support for a proposed LNG Terminal and removed it from the EU’s Projects of Common Interest list (350.org, 2019). The French government stopped a deal between energy firm Engie and a US LNG company, citing climate and environmental impacts (Reuters, 2020b). Data centres The rapidly growing energy usage of data centres is further contributing to devastating climate change and undermining already slow progress in renewables production. A report by Beyond Fossil Fuels says that Europe’s electricity demand from data centres could rise by up to 160 per cent by 2030, reaching 287 TWh/year, more than Spain's total electricity consumption in 2022 (Euronews, 2025a). Prioritising this policy area is vital for the Irish Presidency of the Council because of the unequal consumption of energy by data centres per country, with Ireland’s energy consumption well above the European average (Power Magazine, 2025). Data centres are also heavy water users, often wasting drinking water (Mytton, 2021). Each data centre has a water demand equivalent to a large Irish town. With increasing global heating and water stress, this is another resource challenge that will be exacerbated by proliferation of data centres."

People across Europe are experiencing the effects of climate change. Europe is the fastest warming continent and 2024 was the warmest year on record in Europe, with ‘heatwaves, droughts and floods affecting a quarter of all EU regions’ last summer (Euronews.com, 2025b). Prior to this, in June, ‘a growing share of Europeans (38%)...report feeling personally exposed to environmental and climate-related risks’ (europa.eu, 2025). ‘Climate change caused 16,469 deaths in European cities this summer, new research estimates’ (Gardner, 2025). The climate crisis is upon us. The EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, states: In particular, the European Union will pursue efforts to promote global peace, justice and stability, as well as democracy, universal human rights and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in all international fora The target of maintaining temperatures below 1.5°C has already been missed (UNEP, 2025). We must therefore invest heavily in developing renewable energy and immediately phase out fossil fuels if we are to keep global temperature rise ‘well below 2°C’, a key sustainable development goal coming out of the Paris Agreement which the Strategic Agenda pledges to uphold. Supporting any new major oil and gas infrastructure would lock us into fossil fuel energy for 30-40 years and jeopardise our ability to fulfil our current and future climate action commitments and meet critical global warming limits. It is crucial that the EU does not further lock in its dependence on fossil fuels if we are to meet our climate targets under the Paris Agreement. Solutions to power disruption, and to our wider energy security, lie not in large centralised fossil fuel projects but localised distributed renewables, retrofits, and energy storage, and demand management which prioritises households and essential services over large commercial energy users like data centres. These measures are what Ireland should put on the agenda and promote during its presidency. Legislative proposals on data centres should include: Setting an overall cap on the level of data centre energy demand; required transparency from data about the sectors they are providing services to, and the types of services provided, and allowing bans on some types of services (e.g. some forms of cryptocurrency mining) completely; required flexibility from data centres at times when wind and solar energy on the grid is low relative to demand - and not allowing data centres to use fossil fuel generation as the means of providing this flexibility. New data centres must be powered entirely by, and existing centres should be required to transition rapidly to: On site direct renewable power source generation combined with energy storage, or Off site renewable power source and energy storage with dedicated grid connection (avoiding Renewable Energy Certificates) Any renewable energy infrastructure must comply with best practice public participation 4. New data centres should have infrastructure in place to enable heat generated from them to be utilised for district heating systems"

Public participation is vital as part of a just transition. However, if Ireland and the EU continue their current trajectory of counterproductive and insufficient energy and climate policy, endeavouring to convince citizens of the benefits of its policies is convincing them of policies that are currently leading to their demise. Instead, NHNA urges the Government to lead the EU towards its climate commitments to protect all citizens from the effects of the climate crisis caused by fossil fuels, a key objective of the strategic agenda: The European Union will strengthen its resilience, preparedness, crisis prevention and response capacities, in an all-hazards and whole-of-society approach, to protect our citizens and societies against different crises, including natural disasters and health emergencies. (Strategic Agenda, 2024) While communication strategy is not our primary area of expertise as a grassroots climate group, NHNA recommends that in order to ‘create a sense of ownership amongst citizens’, Ireland must lead the EU in creating actual ownership among citizens, starting with their energy. Rather than profit-driven corporations continuing to lead fossil fuel expansion, energy democracy would ensure citizens control energy production. Energy democracy means that energy is produced by the people, for the people. Renewable energy is produced and controlled at local level by communities and the state, not for-profit private companies. Energy democracy gives rise to green, local employment and allows small and medium-sized social enterprises to develop. This means that energy is cheaper, more accessible, and energy demand is managed more efficiently (Not Here Not Anywhere, 2025). Ireland must seize the opportunity to protect citizens from the climate crisis by leading the EU’s divestment in fossil fuels."

BioPharmaChem Ireland (BPCI) proposes three high-level thematic priorities, centred on securing Europe’s long-term health and economic resilience: 1. A Pro-competitiveness, pro-innovation agenda: Ireland must leverage its Presidency to foster a pro-innovation and pro-competitiveness stance across the EU. This requires a policy focus that stimulates investment, protects Intellectual Property and addresses highly specialised skills shortages in R&D, regulatory science, health and safety, green chemistry and digitalisation. This priority addresses the pressing challenge of underinvestment in innovation identified in The Draghi report on EU competitiveness, which notes that the EU's private sector spends drastically less on pharma R&D compared to the US and China. Draghi identifies this as a key contributing factor to the erosion of the EU pharma sector’s global competitiveness. The report also highlights the lack of specialised skills and talent as a major hindrance to EU competitiveness, particularly within STEM fields. Amidst a new era of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, the Presidency of the Council of the EU offers a critical window to promote policies designed to substantially stimulate investment. Ireland possesses core competitive strengths, such as a highly educated workforce and strong manufacturing infrastructure, that provide the essential capacity to absorb this investment effectively and rapidly translate it into scalable production, thereby driving comprehensive economic growth. Regulatory excellence in the EU: The second priority must be to champion a new era of regulatory excellence. The EU’s life sciences competitiveness is being undermined by a slow, complex and fragmented regulatory system, causing companies and investors to prioritise non-EU markets. Regulatory excellence includes targeted policy intervention aimed at closing the gap with competitors who offer significantly shorter, simpler, predictable and agile approvals. This is a necessary prerequisite for driving investment into the EU and ensuring faster access to innovative medicines for patients. A balanced, innovation-led green transition: The third priority is ensuring the transition to a green economy is strategic and balanced, not self-defeating. Environmental policy must consider the operational needs of the sector to ensure that decarbonisation neither inhibits Europe’s competitiveness nor its ability to produce essential medicines. This priority must also include an active focus on policies that promote access to affordable, renewable energy for industrial users. One of the Irish biopharmachem sector’s greatest barriers to achieving both growth and full carbon neutrality is the inadequate access to renewable energy. If this critical energy deficit is not addressed, production facilities will be forced to relocate outside of Europe, thereby compromising the EU’s crucial manufacturing resilience and strategic autonomy."
404,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c1898ad8/BioPharmaChem_Ireland_Ibec_-_Submission_404.docx,BioPharmaChem Ireland (Ibec),,,,2,"Advocate for measures in the forthcoming EU Biotech Act that will: incentivise innovation, such as leveraging the Single Market Strategy, creating life sciences index funds and de-risking investment in life sciences and, reduce regulatory complexity. Please see BPCI’s submission to the EU Commission’s consultation on the Biotech Act, attached as an appendix, for additional detail. Guarantee significant progress on the national Life Sciences Strategy prior to the Presidency. Equip Ireland with a strategy and a clear set of priorities that can then be promoted at the EU level. This effort must also include the establishment of a dedicated and well-resourced national Office of Life Sciences to serve as the crucial national connection to the EU Life Sciences Strategy. Such an institutional link is essential for ensuring that Ireland can proactively connect with industry domestically while communicating priorities to the EU. Support a competitive regulatory data protection length at least equal to the competitor’s RDP baseline under the General Pharmaceutical Legislation to ensure the EU pharmaceutical sector to remains competitive globally. Promote a proportional and targeted lens for the Critical Medicines Act, ensuring measures such as the mandatory stock requirements are proportional to the actual risk of shortage and patient impact. Similarly, ensure that collaborative procurement options are only used in specific circumstances where they demonstrably accelerate patient access, rather than systematically replacing existing national pricing and reimbursement pathways. Support the re-examination of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive to ensure a fair and just sciencebased system that reflects the polluter pays principle and does not place a disproportionate burden on the pharmaceutical sector. To prevent widespread supply chain disruptions and safeguard patient access to medicine, the EU must adopt a targeted, risk-based approach, not a blanket ban, to the proposed restriction on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) under the EU's REACH Regulation. Essential-use derogations and realistic transition periods are imperative, given that PFAS are critical for the pharmaceutical sector’s ability to produce medicines, as well as for the continuous operation of key European industries like renewable energy, semiconductors, water treatment and medical devices. Create opportunities for thorough stakeholder engagement from the pharmaceutical sector, so all parties have a clear understanding of the complexities of PFAS use and the implications of a ban. Complement environmental policy with innovation policy for an economically viable green transition. EU-level research funding to accelerate the development and validation of viable PFAS alternatives to ensure a robust future supply of medicines. This should be complemented by dedicated R&D support for industrial energy efficiency and green process innovation. Drive policies that ensure access to affordable, secure renewable energy for industrial users. High energy costs affect manufacturing as well as chemical storage, formulation, distribution and recovery facilities. Affordable and predictable renewable energy is essential to retain critical capacity in Europe. Aim to close the gap with jurisdictions who offer shorter, simpler regulatory approvals by ensuring regulatory bodies are appropriately resourced. This funding is essential to conduct early science-led dialogue, manage flexible regulatory sandboxes, streamline regulatory approval pathways and enable the rapid, safe adoption of new technologies. The EU must also offer digitalisation of compliance tools to ease the regulatory burden on SMEs, ensure better alignment between EU agencies, and provide timely decision-making for regulatory policy such as the REACH Regulation."
404,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c1898ad8/BioPharmaChem_Ireland_Ibec_-_Submission_404.docx,BioPharmaChem Ireland (Ibec),,,,3,"Member States’ healthcare systems must transform their approach to bio-pharmaceutical innovation, by moving beyond cost containment to viewing healthcare spending as a strategic investment in societal and economic growth. The Draghi report on EU competitiveness notes that the EU's private sector drastically underinvests in pharmaceutical R&D spending relative to the US and China. This deficiency is compounded by the fragmentation and duplication of public R&D efforts across member states, creating inefficiencies and undermining scale. Draghi also points to the EU’s structural barriers to scale-up, specifically a widening venture capital gap that prevents the translation of innovation into commercial success, as key hinderance to growth. The EU’s R&D competitiveness is already in decline. IQVIA 2024 data indicates European companies started only 21% of new global clinical trials while the US increased its share to 35%. The EU is now squeezed between a rapidly expanding, self-sufficient R&D ecosystem in China and aggressive US financial policies actively pulling investment away. Ultimately, this is a critical patient access issue, as the region that leads R&D delivers new treatments to its citizens first. Failure to compete directly undermines the EU's goal of 'Strategic Autonomy' in health, forcing its patients to wait longer for the next generation of medicines. To reverse this decline in pharma R&D competitiveness, Draghi points to strong IP protections as a catalyst to medical innovation. The report also calls for stability in investment incentives and the leveraging of fiscal policy to finance higher-risk innovation. The EU Biotech Act will aim to accelerate the translation of biotech innovation into improved industrial processes and products that can be brought to market. This a unique opportunity to address inefficiencies and promote investment for the sector. Adding to the investment challenge is a slow, complex, and fragmented regulatory system that compels innovators to navigate dual EU and divergent national laws. Industry prioritises markets offering the clearest and fastest path to approval. Consequently, the EU is now routinely the second or third market for innovative treatments. This regulatory burden is further compounded by a fundamental shift in the global innovation landscape. The R&D pipeline has evolved into a complex spectrum of ""deep tech"" medicines, such as AI-designed drugs and patientspecific cell therapies. These advanced treatments demand agile and adaptable regulatory frameworks that enable the EMA to co-develop regulations in real-time with technologic advancement, rather than waiting years for policy to catch up. If Europe fails to adapt its systems, by implementing tools such as regulatory sandboxes, sector competitiveness will suffer. Finally, the biopharmachem sector strongly supports Ireland’s sustainability commitments and actively champions the green transition. However, environmental policy requires careful calibration. While industry seeks to drive decarbonisation, policy must not inhibit its critical ability to produce life-changing medicines. The Draghi Report directly addresses this dichotomy, calling for a more joined-up approach to policy coordination to mitigate the risk that ""decarbonisation could run contrary to competitiveness and growth."" This principle applies directly to complex regulations like the REACH Regulation and the proposed PFAS restrictions, which must be coordinated with the operational needs of the strategic life sciences supply chain."

Messaging should explain that regulatory reforms, such as streamlining approvals, are not bureaucratic exercises but essential steps to accelerate access to breakthrough medicines for families across the EU. The Presidency’s work can assist Europe in accessing new treatments faster. Communication should clearly link the competitiveness agenda to local economic stability. Highlighting efforts to attract global R&D and manufacturing investment secures high-value, sustainable jobs in local communities. The Presidency’s focus on affordable and secure energy can be framed as directly protecting EU manufacturing, which safeguards local economies from global price volatility and outsourcing. The Presidency’s approach to environmental policy must be communicated as achieving a smart green future. This highlights that Ireland and industry is committed to the green transition while also being responsible to patients by ensuring that critical manufacturing supply chains remain intact. This balanced approach demonstrates that EU policy can be both ambitious and pragmatic, providing a credible path for the sustainable transition that citizens can support."

These priorities are evidence-based, drawing on key findings from BPCI's reports and meticulously informed by direct input from our members to ensure we accurately represent the most critical issues facing the Irish biopharmaceutical, pharmaceutical, and chemical sectors. The BioPharmaChem Ireland (BPCI)’s Manufacturing in Ireland Report highlights the core risks undermining the sector’s future competitiveness. The majority of manufacturers anticipate cost increases in key areas such as materials and energy, with only one in seven projecting an increase in profitability over the next six months. Concurrently, the sector faces major operational challenges, including the regulatory environment, attracting and retaining a quality workforce and persistently rising costs. Critically, trade uncertainty has become the single most pressing issue for the industry. These findings underscore the urgent need for the EU to focus on promoting procompetitiveness measures that will rapidly restore confidence in European business and stimulate crucial long-term investment. BPCI’s Sustainable Strategy and Responsible Care Report 2025, highlights the industry's significant progress toward sustainability goals while simultaneously revealing a critical operational vulnerability. Tracking emission data between 2022 and 2024, the report notes that despite increasing activity, the Irish biopharmachem industry achieved a 26% reduction in carbon emissions and sourced nearly three-quarters of its total electricity consumption from renewable sources. However, this strong sustainability performance is overshadowed by severe energy capacity concerns: 9% of manufacturing sites are currently operating beyond their Maximum Import Capacity (MIC), with a further 12% exceeding 90% of their limit. This creates a serious potential for operational disruptions in the manufacturing of essential medicines, a risk reflected by the fact that approximately three-quarters of the industry is either concerned or very concerned about capacity issues. BPCI's upcoming Indigenous Biopharmachem Strategy report reveals an ecosystem of unexpected scale and diversity, identifying over 130 homegrown companies operating across the full value chain, from pre-clinical discovery to manufacturing and logistics. However, this growth potential is currently constrained by critical structural barriers, specifically regarding infrastructure gaps and the availability of lifecycle capital. The strategy indicates that indigenous companies lack necessary continuous and robust funding support from proof-of-concept to commercialisation, while the fiscal environment requires targeted enhancement to expand entrepreneur reliefs and streamline R&D and EIIS frameworks BPCI’s submission to the EU Commission’s public consultation on the EU Biotech Act, attached as an appendix, provides significant detail regarding opportunities enhance the competitiveness environment for the sector. BPCI welcomes the opportunity to provide further details on the above-mentioned reports and/or policy priorities. We are committed to supporting Ireland’s EU Council Presidency by using our key platforms, such as the BioPharmaChem Impact Conference 2026, to showcase and advance the Presidency’s strategic work to the industry. This collaborative work is designed to ensure that Industry and Government approach the Presidency as unified, strategic partners, thereby maximising its collective impact on the EU agenda."

This recommendation is founded in SVP’s experience supporting those impacted by poverty. Poverty is not abstract: our members regularly work with people in cold, dark homes, who are sacrificing food or heat to afford basics for themselves and their loved ones. For some we support, their inability to make ends meet is new, brought on by personal crisis or rising energy prices and the cost of living; for others, this experience pre-dates Covid-19, and may be intergenerational. Theme 1: Delivering Social Justice in a Social Europe The European Pillar of Social Rights’ Action Plan set the goal of reducing the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by 15 million by 2030, 5 million of which should be children. This would require a reduction below 76 million people, and children to under 18 million: in 2024, there were 93.3 million people in the EU at risk of poverty or social exclusion, roughly 19.5million of which were children. Concerted, countrylevel and EU-wide action is required on poverty. SVP believes the aim should be an eradication, not alleviation of poverty, though we understand reduction as a step in the right direction. For either eradication or reduction, the EU must seriously address the structural drivers of poverty—this is not possible without the inclusion of the voices and perspectives of those living in poverty. Though we advocate for a focus on poverty, we emphasise that this focus must be cross-cutting if it is to deliver meaningful change. Theme 2: Revitalising the Just Transition Though the ‘green transition’ has recently been prioritised by Denmark’s 2025 EU Presidency, it is important that principles of equality and social justice be embedded in the energy transition as a ‘just transition’. The just transition must be prioritised within the EU Presidency agenda to ensure that vulnerable groups and communities are able to enjoy the benefits of the energy transition and are not disproportionately impacted by its costs. This includes attention to existing systemic inequalities that may be exacerbated by the energy transition and therefore require additional investment. As a leader in renewable energy, Ireland is well-placed to lead conversations on equality within the transition at the EU level. It is important that as the EU scales up its energy transition, it continues to invest in and implement policies to bridge short-term implications for energy poverty and ensure the just transition achieves equality and dignity for all EU households."

Any Strategy must be cross-cutting and must target those groups most at risk of poverty, such as children, minority ethnic groups such as Travellers and Roma, lone-parents, disabled people, migrants, and older people. The Strategy must include clear, time-bound targets. Child poverty requires additional focus within the strategy. Beyond the Strategy, Ireland may further support reduction in child poverty through monitoring of members states’ implementation of the European Child Guarantee. Adequate Minimum Income and Adequate Minimum Wages As part of the implementation of the Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, the Council Recommendation acknowledges the important role of Minimum Income Schemes in social protection schemes. However, the Recommendation is non-binding and lacks concrete measures to target groups such as Travellers and Roma. Many Minimum Income Schemes, including Ireland’s, continue to be inadequate to meet actual needs for those relying on social protection. We recommend that Ireland develop the Council Recommendation into a binding EU Directive on Minimum Income Schemes. Any such Directive must work in tandem with the 2022 Directive on Adequate Minimum Wages. The Multiannual Financial Framework 2028-2034 The new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is currently in development and will amount to nearly €2 trillion. Within this, a key measure in the MFF is the European Social Fund Plus, which is specifically targeted at addressing material deprivation, promoting social inclusion, and fighting poverty and homelessness. The Irish 2026 EU Presidency is an opportunity to direct negotiations on the MFF toward social investment on issues such as poverty and housing. SVP recommends that attention to social justice not be limited to the Social Fund Plus: poverty is a cross-cutting issue and must be invested in accordingly. Affordable Housing Plan 2026 Given Ireland’s own housing and homelessness crisis, Ireland must use its EU Presidency to lead joint EU action to prioritise affordable housing and homelessness prevention. The European Commission has committed to putting forward an Affordable Housing Plan in 2026—Ireland should play an active role in the development of this Plan in association with key stakeholders in housing and homelessness. The Plan must include targeted actions on accessibility for disabled homes and solutions to address housing for ethnic minority groups such as Travellers and Roma. Action on housing during the EU Presidency should include the introduction of a Council Recommendation on ending homelessness that contains. Action on housing in Ireland’s 2026 Presidency should be accompanied by investment. We further recommend that the housing crisis form a major theme in events planned as part of the Presidency and that these events centre stakeholders."

Our most recent SILC figures show a rise in consistent poverty, a rise even greater for children, 8.5% of whom are now in consistent poverty. Deprivation figures suggest that roughly 807,800 people in Ireland are going without basics: 7.4% of people went without heating at some point last year. As of November 2025, there are 16,766 people in emergency accommodation – 5,274 of whom are children. This is an increase of 1800 people in the 12 months to November 2025 and does not include those in ‘hidden’ homelessness. Our housing crisis has additional impacts on social cohesion: over 5,300 people in IPAS accommodation have received status to remain yet are stuck in direct provision because they lack suitable housing options. Low-income households continue to be most negatively affected by housing insecurity, which directly impacts on their long-term wellbeing and participation in society. These challenges are not unique to Ireland: in 2024, 21.0% of the population of the EU were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This risk is higher for women and young adults, as well as households with children. Rising housing costs and shortage are increasingly faced across the EU, with 17% of Europeans living in overcrowded homes. We emphasise these challenges because they offer a roadmap for where policy-making in Ireland and the EU must go in the coming years. In 2026, Ireland has a unique opportunity to focus attention on these shared challenges through its EU Presidency."

A central thematic priority should be modernising EU animal welfare legislation to ensure consistent, enforceable standards across Member States in farming, transport, wildlife management, companion animals and scientific research. This strengthens the internal market, reinforces the EU’s One Health approach, and supports public health. Ireland should champion transparent food labelling, enabling consumers to make informed choices. Labelling should clearly indicate production methods, housing systems, transport conditions and whether painful practices were used (e.g., tail docking, beak trimming, or other procedures performed without anaesthesia). Transparency empowers consumers, supports higher-welfare producers and aligns with EU objectives on consumer protection. Conversely, legislative attention devoted to restricting the use of “meaty terms” on plant-based products diverts resources from more pressing welfare concerns. Consumers are not confused by plant-based labelling; instead, they deserve honest, welfare-relevant information about animal-derived foods. Ireland and the EU should also lead on ethical import standards, including progressing EU-wide action to end the fur farming trade in all EU Member States and the sale and import of fur products and to prevent the import of low-welfare animal products produced under conditions that would be unlawful within the EU. In addition, Ireland’s Presidency provides a critical opportunity to ensure meaningful progress toward ending the use, production, and trade of foie gras, veal from restrictive systems, and caged-rabbit meat. Another priority is wildlife protection, including addressing practices such as hare coursing and fox hunting. The Irish hare, listed under Annex V of the Habitats Directive, requires conservation measures inconsistent with coursing and capture. Ireland can help facilitate a broader EU dialogue on aligning wildlife management with sentience obligations. Finally, the Presidency should advance responsible scientific innovation, promote scientific innovation through accelerating the transition toward validated alternatives to animal testing. Positioning animal welfare as a central thematic priority delivers ethical, environmental, economic and public health benefits for all EU citizens."

Transparent EU food labelling Ireland should advocate for mandatory welfare-related labelling, ensuring consumers know how animals were kept, transported and treated. This includes disclosure of painful practices. 2. Ethical import standards The EU should not import or sell products derived from fur farming, a practice already banned in many Member States, nor low-welfare animal products produced under conditions prohibited within the EU. Ireland should progress Council discussions on trade rules that uphold welfare, traceability and consumer trust. 3. Stronger dog breeding and traceability rules Ireland faces significant welfare issues and reputational damage linked to intensive dog breeding. An EU-level approach to traceability, breeder regulation and cross-border sale of dogs is essential to protect consumers and animals. 4. Equine traceability Improvements to equine traceability and enforcement of the laws should be prioritised to support biosecurity, food safety and welfare. 5. Live animal transport reform Ireland should work towards stronger limits on journey times, stricter conditions, and long-term transition toward meat-only or carcass-only trade, reducing welfare risks. 6. Phase-out of cages & review of intensive animal farming The Presidency can facilitate progress on the long-awaited legislative proposal to end caged housing systems, aligning regulation with scientific evidence and public demand. Intensive farming, including pig farming, poultry farming, and fish farming also require review due to their impacts on animal welfare, habitat degradation, pollution, antimicrobial and zoonotic disease risk. Ireland and the EU should support a shift toward more sustainable models, including greater supports for arable farming to reduce pressure on landscapes and improve environmental and welfare outcomes. In addition, Ireland’s Presidency provides a critical opportunity to ensure meaningful progress toward ending the use, production, and trade of foie gras, veal from restrictive systems, and caged-rabbit meat. 7. Wildlife protection and ending inhumane practices The Irish hare, protected under the Habitats Directive (Annex V), is still used in hare coursing. Ireland can highlight the need for consistent EU-wide protection for vulnerable wildlife and encourage dialogue on ending practices such as hare coursing and fox hunting, which raise significant welfare, biodiversity and enforcement concerns. 8. Animal testing Ireland and the EU should push for investment in non-animal scientific methods and regulatory acceptance of validated alternatives, progressing the EU’s commitment to eventual phase-out. 9. Marine protection and effective Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) Strengthening MPAs under the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 would protect vulnerable marine specie, including cetaceans, seals and seabirds, from bycatch, noise disturbance and habitat degradation. Ireland can advance clearer EU standards for MPA management, improved bycatch mitigation and better monitoring. This supports biodiversity, coastal communities and the welfare of sentient marine animals. 10. Environmental protection, pollution, habitat loss. Ireland should also prioritise EU action on environmental protection and habitat loss, including tackling habitat loss and reducing pollution from farming and associated industries. Strengthening these areas supports biodiversity, protects water quality and directly improves welfare outcomes for wildlife and farmed animals alike."

Transparent welfare-related food labelling empowers consumers and strengthens trust in the food chain. It also supports farmers who invest in higher-welfare systems by allowing them to differentiate their products. Improving standards, such as phasing out cages, reducing long-distance transport and improving enforcement of dog and equine traceability, creates a level competitive playing field and reduces illegal activity that harms rural communities. Progress on restricting low-welfare imports and fur products protects EU producers from unfair competition and aligns the market with consumer expectations. Strengthening biodiversity protections, including addressing hare coursing and fox hunting, reinforces the Habitats Directive and protects vulnerable species such as the Irish hare. Advancing alternatives to animal testing supports innovation, sustainable growth and ethical science. Collectively, these measures improve public health, reduce antimicrobial use, strengthen environmental protection and elevate the EU’s global leadership in welfare standards."

Ireland can highlight how EU membership ensures higher standards, protects consumers and safeguards biodiversity, including species protected under EU law, such as the Irish hare. Communicating progress on updated welfare legislation, import restrictions on low-welfare products, and improved enforcement will demonstrate the EU’s responsiveness to public priorities. Emphasising consumer benefits, accurate welfare labelling, safer food, reduced disease risks and ethical trade, helps citizens feel directly connected to EU decision-making. Positive stories, ethical farms, innovative alternatives to testing, biodiversity protection, can build trust and strengthen the sense of shared European responsibility. Ireland could also use targeted social media campaigns, short explainer videos and accessible infographics to help citizens understand the issues being discussed at Council level. Paid ads or boosted posts during key Presidency milestones would ensure broad reach, particularly for younger audiences. Clear, plain-language updates, preferably in video format, shared through Instagram, TikTok, X, Facebook and LinkedIn, would make EU processes feel more visible, engaging and relevant to everyday life. The Council of the EU often uses engaging visuals, even featuring dogs in some of its social media posts.

Citizens deserve higher welfare, stronger enforcement, sustainable food systems and clear and transparent food labelling that reflects real conditions, so they can make informed decisions. Addressing issues such as dog breeding, inconsistent equine traceability, long-distance transport, painful and unethical farming practices, and the sale of fur products will strengthen the internal market and improve welfare outcomes. Furthermore, current national practices, such as hare coursing and fox hunting, sit uneasily alongside Article 13 TFEU, the Habitats Directive, and UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (Art. 19 right not to witness violence, see also General Comment 26). Ireland can lead an honest discussion on aligning Member State practices with modern welfare expectations and EU law. Transparent food labelling, ethical import policy, and investment in alternatives to animal testing all contribute to a more sustainable, trusted and forward-looking European Union. Ireland can help deliver this vision."

Events throughout the 6 months that drive home the importance of our stories and how we tell them to ourselves brings home the message of the priorities we have identified above. While those priorities are high level and effect policy positions, the end results of the actions impact how Irish, and European, stories are conceived and conveyed beyond the policy platform. Producers are creative entrepreneurs who produce celebrated film, animation, and TV, creating high-value all-island and regionally spread employment, fostering Europe’s media production eco-system along with promoting Ireland’s artistic culture and heritage The Independent production sector is an integral element in the delivery of public service media to audiences across Ireland and Europe. The audiovisual production sector industry is central to the creative industries in Ireland. It drives innovation, creativity, and economic growth, while fostering cultural diversity and supporting skilled employment across the creative industries, with over 15K FTE roles per year currently in the audiovisual sector. However, it is important that targeted measures are taken to support the audiovisual sector, and wider creative industries in Ireland. While the creative industries in Ireland accounts for 3.73% of Ireland’s gross value added, this unfortunately falls below the EU average of 5.54% of GVA. Alongside this, there are significant threats to the current public service media sphere, a recent statement which was signed by industry representative bodies globally stated that: “We are witnessing increasingly aggressive attempts by powerful political and corporate actors to dismantle the regulatory protections that ensure the diversity and accessibility of cultural expression.” Considering this context, Ireland must continue to safeguard its burgeoning screen industry, which over the past number of years has gained a reputation as an excellent filming location for both indigenous and incoming productions."

The European Strategy on sustainable tourism is due to be launched in Q2 2026. This is just before the term of the Irish presidency of the EU council. Ireland has been relatively successful in avoiding strong overtourism sentiment, with 9/10 people saying tourism is ‘good for their community’ in a study in 2024 by Fáilte Ireland, and this is influenced by tourism supporting local SMEs, across regions. As many member states struggle with concentration and overtourism it is a good opportunity to share more sustainable approaches – which include promoting experience brands like the Wild Atlantic Way, or Ireland’s Hidden Heartlands, and year round tourism, for example, leveraging sporting events and festivals like St Patrick’s day in March, or our newer ‘Ireland, Home of Halloween’ activations in October. Home of Halloween highlights the origins of Halloween 2000 years ago in Celtic culture, and attracted 50M Euros worth of incremental trip bookings this Autumn, to attend modern day festivals island wide. Intra-European Connectivity At a time of global uncertainty, there are benefits to developing Intra-European tourism. Tourism Ireland recently completed a Mainland European Appraisal, to look at growing spend from European visitors to Ireland from 2B Euros per year in 2024 to 2.75B Euros per year by 2030, with investment. For all member states, proximity of European markets is beneficial from the point of view of sustainable travel, from close by, accessible markets. As an EU agenda point, building travel connections between the member states and in particular developing new tourist markets in less explored regions of member states can deliver employment and prosperity within the EU. Tourism strengthens cultural and social connections between member states and can aid our broader European sense of identity and appreciation. Reconciliation and Collaboration across borders This is the 3rd Irish Presidency of the EU Council since the Good Friday Agreement, all going well, it is due to be only the second that the Northern Ireland executive has been in operation (the institutions were suspended for the 2004 Irish presidency, but in operation for the 2013 Irish presidency). EU member states and the EU institutions showed enormous solidarity with Ireland during the Brexit period of negotiations. The upcoming Irish presidency is against a backdrop of polarisation and conflict across the globe. Therefore, the Irish Presidency of the Council is a timely opportunity to showcase the success of the Good Friday Agreement as well as EU investment in Northern Ireland and the border regions."

Public confidence in EU climate and energy policy depends on the reliability of sustainability claims attached to all decarbonisation pathways — renewable fuels, renewable electricity, hydrogen, RFNBOs, synthetic fuels and emerging low-carbon technologies. Today, that confidence is undermined by structural weaknesses in the Union’s systems for certification, auditing, data quality, and traceability. A Presidency theme such as “Credibility in the Climate Transition” would directly support the Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, which highlights the Union’s need to become climate-neutral while strengthening competitiveness, resilience and public trust. It would also reflect the Programme for Government commitment to improve traceability in HVO procurement to ensure the product is from sustainable sources. Because certification of feedstocks is an EU competenceunder the Renewable Energy Directive, national implementation cannot succeed without EU-level reform. Focusing the Presidency on credibility would help reconcile environmental ambition, industrial competitiveness and fairness for citizens. It would demonstrate Ireland’s ability to act as a neutral, constructive broker across all Council configurations by: Promoting transparency and traceability across all energy vectors, not just individual technologies or fuels. Supporting the development of consistent, reliable and enforceable verification systems. Encouraging effective implementation of EU law to avoid market fragmentation and loss of trust. This cross-cutting integrity agenda is one that only an EU Presidency can meaningfully advance, and one that would strengthen the foundation of Europe’s climate transition for the decade ahead."

Although renewable fuels provide a clear and immediate example, the underlying governance challenge is broader. A credible climate transition requires technology-neutral systems that apply consistent verification standards to renewable electricity, hydrogen, RFNBOs, synthetic fuels, biofuels and emerging technologies alike. Four Presidency priorities are recommended: Deliver a fully operational, independently verified and mandatory Union Database (UDB) Including uniform auditing standards, real-time integrity checks and open interoperability. This is essential to providing reliable chain-of-custody data for all energy pathways counted towards EU climate targets. Harmonise sustainability checks across all Member States With standardised verification of feedstock provenance, emissions calculations and traceability requirements — to reduce market distortion, strengthen competitiveness and ensure equal treatment of all technologies. Strengthen EU-level enforcement mechanisms Including clear escalation procedures where national oversight is insufficient. Weak enforcement creates unfair competition, undermines climate targets, and increases costs for compliant businesses and consumers. Introduce proportionate enhanced scrutiny for high-risk inputs and pathways Including, but not limited to, certain waste oils, residues and other categories where documented risks of fraud are highest. Ireland should aim for Presidency Conclusions or a Progress Report that: Embeds technology-neutral, credibility-focused governance as a core principle of RED implementation. Commits Member States to strengthening traceability and verification across all renewable and low-carbon pathways. Accelerates technical and governance reforms to the UDB. Reinforces consistent enforcement and better implementation across the Union.

For consumers and communities: A trustworthy certification and traceability system ensures that climate-related costs borne by households and businesses translate into real emissions reductions. Weak certification ultimately increases consumer costs by allowing distortions, rewarding non-compliance, and undermining confidence in climate measures. Strengthening governance supports fairness, transparency and public buy-in. For businesses and European industry: Consistent EU-wide enforcement protects compliant operators from being undercut by non-compliant competitors. This reinforces competitiveness, supports high-quality employment and encourages investment in genuinely sustainable technologies. For environmental integrity: Robust verification ensures that emissions reductions reported under RED III are real, measurable and credible — a prerequisite for progress towards 2030 and 2050 climate goals. For Member States and public administrations: Stronger EU systems reduce duplication, improve implementation, and support the uniform application of EU rules.

CKD sits at the intersection of metabolic health, most often evolving alongside cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes and other metabolic disorders. While we welcome the EU’s renewed attention to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in particular, we regret the persistent low level of policy attention and investment directed toward kidney disease. Prioritizing CVDs and diabetes while neglecting kidney disease is neither scientifically sound nor cost-effective for healthcare systems, and it has serious, sometimes tragic, consequences for patients. Ireland, supported by a strong stakeholder community such as the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Nephrology Society, and building on its long-standing commitment to improving public health, has a significant window to address this gap during its upcoming EU presidency. EKHA recommends three high-level thematic priorities: Renew and update the EU’s commitment to kidney health CKD affects 1 in 8 Europeans and is projected to become the third leading cause of death in Western Europe by 2050 - a 95% increase since 2000. Despite its scale and societal cost, kidney disease remains largely absent from major EU health initiatives and lacks robust political recognition compared to other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Ireland’s Presidency can play an instrumental role in ensuring kidney health is fully integrated into the EU’s NCD strategy and related policy processes, aligning with the WHO Resolution on Kidney Health adopted in May 2025. Improve prevention, screening, and early treatment The potential to prevent kidney disease or slow its progression remains vastly underutilised, even though screening is cost-effective, clinically impactful and can be integrated within other diseases ‘early detection programmes. Albuminuria screening for example, has proven its value as a scalable and actionable clinical biomarker to assess risk and progress of both kidney disease and CVD. The EU should support Member States in harmonising approaches to early detection through a new Council Recommendation on joint CVD/CKD/Diabetes screening. Ireland’s recent decision to integrate kidney disease among the diseases to be screened alongside CVDs and diabetes within the National Chronic Disease Management Programme, provides an inspiring model that could be replicated across EU Member States. 3. Achieve equitable access to high-quality treatments for kidney failure Transplantation is the optimal treatment for kidney failure, delivering the best outcomes at the lowest economic and ecological cost. It is also the only life-saving option for organ failure of the heart, liver and lungs. Yet access to transplantation remains unequal across Europe, and dialysis, while lifesaving for endstage kidney failure, remains highly burdensome for patients and carries significant financial and environmental strain. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise updating the EU Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (mandated by Council Conclusions in 2024) as a way to strengthen mutual learning across countries and sectors, expand donation after circulatory determination of death (DCDD), enhance living donation framework, and improve education and training, among other urgent priorities needed to address the growing shortage of organs in the EU."

An official, high-level ministerial event during the EU Irish Presidency focusing on kidney disease would represent a major step forward in breaking the silence. This event would mark the first EU forum to kick-start in-depth discussions and decisive actions aimed at tackling the escalating threat of kidney disease. Building on the landmark 2025 WHO resolution on kidney disease, the event could highlight the need for prevention, early detection and management of kidney disease and associated metabolic disorders (Hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, obesity) and access to affordable and high-quality care. Lead the development of an EU Council Recommendation on CKD, CVD and Diabetes’ Screening There are substantial gaps in kidney disease diagnosis. Building on the success of the Council Recommendation on cancer screening and the European Cardiovascular Health Plan’s recommendations on CVD’s health checks, there is a timely opportunity for Ireland to extend this progress by leading the development of a Council Recommendation on joint screening for kidney disease, CVD and diabetes – three conditions that share similar risk factors and frequently develop together. 3. Work alongside the European Commission to update the EU Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation Transplantation stands as one of the most cost-effective approaches for treating advanced NCDs that impact the kidney, heart, liver and lungs. The added value of EU collaboration in this field has widely been demonstrated by the success of the EU legislative framework on organ donation and transplantation, and the associated action plan, which ended in 2015. Last year, the Council Conclusions on transplantation formally invited the European Commission to update its action plan. It is now crucial to maintain political momentum and reaffirm Member States’ consensus on this issue, for example through follow-up conclusions and/or a Council resolution, to ensure that these recommendations have a meaningful impact on patients."

CKD affects 1 in 8 Europeans and is extremely costly for Member States. For example, in Ireland, provision of treatment of end-stage kidney failure is costing the Irish payer almost EUR 1 million per day, or EUR 125,000 every year. Without intervention, this burden will escalate, straining health systems and economies. Already in Ireland, the current rate of increase is such that every year, the equivalents of two new dialysis units are needed. By embedding kidney health into EU policy, Ireland can create measurable improvements in health outcomes, economic resilience, and social equity, while ensuring long-term health cost saving. For People: Early detection and prevention strategies will significantly improve life expectancy and quality of life for millions. CKD often progresses silently until advanced stages, yet screening and timely intervention can halt or slow progression. Integrating kidney health into NCD frameworks ensures patients receive comprehensive care alongside cardiovascular and diabetes screening and management. Expanding access to transplantation (the gold standard treatment) reduces mortality, costs and enhances quality. For Businesses: CKD-related productivity losses and healthcare costs undermine economic stability. By reducing disease progression through prevention and early treatment, Ireland’s Presidency can help lower absenteeism and improve workforce participation. Given the growing burden of kidney disease, there is clear and growing interest from the industry in developing treatments that will help address this challenge. Recognizing kidney disease as a policy priority with unmet needs would further stimulate innovation across medical technologies, pharmaceuticals and digital health, while creating new market opportunities and supporting Europe’s competitiveness in health innovation. For Communities: Health inequalities remain stark across Member States, with vulnerable populations (including the elderly, children, and displaced persons) facing barriers to care. Ireland can champion equity indicators and targeted funding mechanisms to close these gaps. Cross-border collaboration on organ donation and transplantation fosters solidarity and ensures that lifesaving treatments are accessible regardless of geography."

Health is a universal concern, and initiatives that improve prevention, equity, and access can resonate strongly with citizens. Public Awareness Campaigns Ireland should launch a Europe-wide campaign highlighting the Presidency’s commitment to improving health outcomes through collaborative EU action. Messaging can emphasize the cross-border nature of health threats and showcase how EU-level action on screening and organ donation and transplantation can directly benefit citizens. Linking kidney health to broader NCD prevention, as well as highlighting its cost-saving nature, can reinforce the EU’s role in addressing health issues. Showcase Success Stories Communicating real-world examples of EU solidarity, such as cross-border organ sharing and transplantation programs, will make the benefits of EU action on kidney health tangible. These stories should illustrate how cooperation saves lives and reduces inequalities, fostering trust and pride in EU institutions. Digital Engagement and Citizen Participation Interactive platforms can create a sense of ownership. Ireland could promote patient-led initiatives, such as peer support networks and digital health literacy programs, to empower citizens and demonstrate how EU policies enable innovation and inclusivity. Virtual town halls and social media campaigns can invite public input on health priorities, reinforcing transparency and engagement.

A Competitive and Entrepreneurial Single Market Reinforcing the Single Market—particularly for services, digital products, and emerging technologies—should be a core priority. Ireland can support reforms that unlock entrepreneurship, strengthen research and innovation ecosystems, and enhance the scaling capacity of European SMEs and startups. 4. Social Inclusion, Youth Empowerment, and Community Resilience Ireland should foreground policies that promote equity, cohesion, and community development, emphasising support for marginalised groups, urban regeneration, and social innovation. This aligns strongly with Ireland’s national priorities and its partner network across education, community development, and youth services. 5. A Sustainable, Green, and Secure Europe Ireland should reinforce climate action aligned with the 2040 climate-neutrality trajectory, while prioritising energy security, just transition, and biodiversity.

As Europe undergoes rapid technological, demographic, and economic transformation, the role of higher education institutions—particularly those with strong community, access, and industry networks—will be essential to ensuring a resilient, competitive, and cohesive Union. Ireland’s Presidency offers an opportunity to strengthen Europe’s capacity to support learners at all stages of life, particularly those from disadvantaged or underrepresented backgrounds. NCI recommends that the Presidency promote a joined-up European approach to widening participation across tertiary education and vocational pathways, with a focus on learners experiencing socio-economic disadvantage, early school leavers, newly arrived migrants, and NEET youth. Ensuring that every individual can access high-quality, flexible pathways into skills, work, and further learning will be vital to Europe’s competitiveness and social cohesion. NCI also encourages Ireland to promote more ambitious frameworks for work-based learning, apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship pathways as part of the European Skills Agenda. Many Member States lack a coordinated early-stage and bridging skills ecosystem. Ireland can lead by sharing successful models that integrate industry partnerships, digital skills training, wraparound supports, and community engagement—elements that have proven effective in improving outcomes for underserved communities and supporting progression into tertiary study or employment. Ireland should also amplify the importance of micro-credentials and flexible, stackable learning. These tools can support transitions into and within tertiary education, help mid-career workers adapt to changes driven by AI and automation, and foster greater mobility within the Single Market. NCI would welcome an Irish Presidency that seeks to standardise micro-credential recognition across the EU, enabling individuals to build skills gradually and transparently, regardless of geography. Given Ireland’s strengths in digital innovation, there is a unique opportunity to champion equitable access to AI education and digital literacy. The Presidency could emphasise initiatives ensuring that schools, colleges, tertiary institutions, SMEs, and communities can harness AI technologies safely and effectively. Embedding ethical AI principles into EU education and training frameworks would help establish Europe as a global leader in responsible innovation. Finally, NCI encourages the Presidency to maintain a strong focus on social inclusion, community resilience, early childhood education interventions and access to tertiary education. Policy development should consider the needs of urban and rural disadvantaged areas, supporting investments in education, childcare, community services, and lifelong learning. A fair transition—digital, green, and economic—must ensure that every community benefits from Europe’s progress. Ireland’s Presidency can make a distinct contribution by placing people, skills, tertiary access, and equity at the heart of Europe’s future. NCI stands ready to collaborate with Government and EU partners to advance these aims."

EFPIA represents the biopharmaceutical industry operating in Europe. Through its direct membership of 36 national associations, 40 leading pharmaceutical companies and a growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), EFPIA’s mission is to create a collaborative environment that enables our members to innovate, discover, develop and deliver new therapies and vaccines for people across Europe, as well as contribute to the European economy.","Healthcare, pharmaceuticals",EU wide,1,"We suggest that Ireland should emphasise Europe’s competitiveness as a key Presidency and Trio theme. Over a year ago, Mario Draghi issued a wake-up call to Europe: the rapidly shifting global environment is posing an existential challenge to the foundations of the European economy. While Draghi’s diagnosis was sobering, his prescription was equally clear. The EU must close the innovation gap with the United States and China and place competitiveness at the heart of its policymaking. Today, restoring Europe’s competitiveness has become a geopolitical necessity. As the world order recalibrates, strengthening the EU’s innovation leadership and adopting smarter, more resilient trade policies, are the best vehicles to safeguarding Europe’s international standing, while improving citizens’ wellbeing. Nowhere is this more evident than in the field of health. At the end of the 20th century, Europe was the pharmacy of the world, responsible for developing half of all the innovative medicines globally. Today, that share has fallen to 1/5. In the last 20 years, Europe has lost a quarter of its global share of R&D investment. This decline affects European citizens directly: the EU has lost 60,000 clinical trials places in the last decade, and patients in Europe must now wait significantly longer to access newly approved medicines than those in the United States. To reverse this course, Ireland should use its Presidency of the Council of the EU to sustain and strengthen the momentum behind Europe’s competitiveness agenda, fully aligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, the Commission’s Competitiveness Compass, and the recommendations set out in the Draghi Report. In practice, this requires action across three key priorities. We believe the Irish Presidency should: First, work to ensure that the EU’s legislation strengthens Europe’s ability to research, develop and manufacture products in a competitive global environment. Across health, industry, research, single market, finance, environment and chemicals policy, substantial work is needed to reduce regulatory burdens, streamline bureaucratic overload, and create the conditions and incentives that enable companies to scale up in Europe. Second, ensure that EU trade policy supports Europe’s competitiveness. This requires safeguarding and deepening the transatlantic partnership, ensuring that the EU’s diversification strategy and free trade negotiations deliver real opportunities for innovative industries, and championing a multilateral agenda that advances open trade at a time when protectionist pressures are rising. Third, lead a strategic conversation on Europe’s choice to remain a global leader in the research, development, and production of new medicines. Closing the competitiveness gap with the US and China will require a clear, collective decision to invest more on innovation. The Presidency should lead these efforts by establishing a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce bringing together key stakeholders to comprehensively address the barriers to the sector’s competitiveness. Ireland’s recent history demonstrates how a strong focus on competitiveness can drive remarkable social and economic progress. By championing competitiveness and delivering on these three key priorities, the Irish Presidency can help steer the EU toward a future in which innovation delivers fairer outcomes for all."

On the Biotech Act I, the Presidency should ensure the legislation strengthens Europe’s IP framework, simplifies and harmonises clinical trials, establishes end-to-end regulatory oversight, creates a coherent framework for advanced manufacturing, expands access to funding and investment opportunities, and harnesses digitalisation and AI. Ireland should implement the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan by adopting the Council Recommendation on health checks and preparing a Recommendation on vaccination against respiratory infections. The Presidency should prioritise cancer through a renewed Pact to Act and sustained focus on the EBCP, the EU Cancer Mission, and the national cancer control plans implementation. COMPET Regarding the Public Procurement Act, Ireland should prioritise clinical value, quality, and secure supply over price-only or winner-takes-all models. Any EU preference and localisation criteria should be applied carefully to avoid market distortions and remain consistent with international commitments. On the European Innovation Act, the Presidency should simplify and clarify legislation, strengthening IP and market incentives to secure investments, supporting dare-to-try approaches, and enabling access to capital and markets for all companies. Ireland should work towards a General Approach on the European Research Act and drive early engagement with industry on any provisions that may affect its research activities, including AI, partnerships, clinical research, and IP management. GAC Ireland should pursue an ambitious and earmarked budget for health within the MFF, including but not limited to the Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe. The latter should include a significant budget for collaborative research (Pillar II - Health) with a focus on public-private partnerships and rules that reflect industrial realities and enable novel agile collaborations. ENVI Ireland should advance the revision of REACH and conclude the Environmental Omnibus, supporting innovation for the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and ensuring simplification of EU acts by reducing duplications of requirements and administrative burden. In preparation of the Circular Economy Act, the Presidency should prioritise sustainable manufacturing, support to innovation, and responsible resource use, recognising the highly regulated nature and global supply chains of medicines. Ireland should schedule discussions on the universal PFAS restriction proposal to bring clarity on impact on medicines and their manufacturing. External Competitiveness FAC/TRADE The Presidency should safeguard and deepen the transatlantic partnership by seeking exemptions and/or a grace period for potential tariffs on innovative pharmaceutical products, ensuring medicines are excluded from any potential retaliatory measures, and promoting a positive transatlantic agenda. Ireland should also drive the EU’s diversification strategy by requiring strong IP protection in all EU FTAs, advancing harmonisation of regulatory requirements, and ensuring fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory market access. Multilaterally, the Presidency should defend the WTO rules-based trading system, resist protectionist pressures, and ensure international agreements do not create legal uncertainties or impose unworkable obligations on companies."

Besides advancing the EU’s legislative agenda, the Irish Presidency has a major opportunity to shape the high-level strategic discussions needed to future-proof the European economy. In line with Draghi’s recommendations, one of the central debates must focus on closing the EU’s widening innovation gap with the United States and China. The research-based pharmaceutical sector is essential to this effort. It delivers the strongest contribution to the EU’s trade balance, reinvests a higher share of its revenue into research and development than any other sector, and serves as a catalyst for breakthrough technologies such as biotechnology, AI, and digital health. Across the Union, the innovative pharmaceutical industry directly employs more than 950,000 people and supports over 2.6 million additional jobs. EU leaders have repeatedly acknowledged the sector’s strategic value. Pharma and healthcare feature among the ten strategic sectors identified in the Draghi report. In October 2025, the European Council reaffirmed the need for a strong pharmaceutical sector in Europe, echoing the European Commission’s ambition to make the EU the world’s most attractive destination for life sciences by 2030. Yet the environment for pharmaceutical investment, innovation, and access in Europe is deteriorating, and the situation is exacerbated by the United States government increasing pressure through tariffs and its MFN pricing policy. As one of Europe’s largest exporters of medicines, Ireland is uniquely positioned to help drive the creation of a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce, composed of the European Commission (Trade, Industry, and Health Commissioners), Member States, and industry partners. This Taskforce should pursue two core objectives. First, it should pave the way for a strong, unified political statement in support of Europe’s research-based pharmaceutical sector, delivered as a high-level Declaration during the Irish Presidency. This Declaration should reaffirm the sector’s strategic importance and articulate the EU’s clear choice to invest in its future to avoid becoming dependent on innovation happening elsewhere. Second, the Taskforce should translate this commitment into practical change. By addressing both domestic and external challenges to competitiveness, the second key output of the Taskforce should be a selection of five key benchmarking ‘innovation’ indicators that enable progress to be tracked at both national and EU level in the years ahead. By helping to address the competitiveness challenges facing the innovative pharmaceutical sector in a comprehensive and forward-looking way, the Irish Presidency can deliver a lasting positive impact for people, businesses, and communities across the EU. Making the right strategic choices now will help Europe close the innovation gap, improve health outcomes for patients, and generate sustainable economic growth and security for the decades ahead."

Ireland’s upcoming Presidency of the Council of the EU offers a unique opportunity to highlight these achievements and create a strong sense of national ownership. A defining factor in this success has been the EU’s principle of solidarity, which ensures that prosperity, security, and opportunity are shared across Member States. This collective spirit has supported Ireland’s economic transformation, strengthened resilience during economic crises and public health emergencies, and enabled sustained investment and innovation. One of the EU’s most visible success stories is the Single Market. By providing unhindered access to a market of over 447 million consumers, EU membership has enabled Irish companies to grow, export, and compete globally. For the innovative pharmaceutical sector, the Single Market has been transformative. Ireland now hosts the largest pharmaceutical production footprint in Europe, with output valued at €67 billion in 2023, and supporting around 50,000 high-quality, direct jobs across the island. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also delivered enormous benefits for Irish patients. Since its creation in 1995, the EMA has ensured that all EU citizens – whether in Cork or Copenhagen – benefit from a single, centralised approval system for medicines grounded in world-class scientific expertise. Looking ahead, the implementation of joint Health Technology Assessment has the potential to further improve consistency, transparency, and efficiency in evaluating clinical evidence across Member States. These mechanisms give EU patients faster, safer, and more equitable access to medical innovation. The EU’s coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic showcased the power of acting together in times of crisis. Thanks to common action, scientific cooperation and regulatory efficiency, Irish citizens gained fast and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. The European Commission secured up to 4.2 billion doses for Member States, and by August 2023, 84.8% of the EU adult population had received at least one dose. Ireland embodied the principle of solidarity by achieving one of the highest vaccine uptake rates in Europe, helping protect communities nationwide and accelerating Ireland’s recovery. Finally, EU membership has strengthened Ireland’s research and innovation ecosystem through collaborative partnerships like the Innovative Medicines Initiative and the Innovative Health Initiative. These programmes, bringing together industry, academia, SMEs, and patient organisations, have provided major funding opportunities and supported Ireland’s universities and research centres in contributing to cutting-edge medical breakthroughs. A strong example is the IMI SOPHIA project, in which University College Cork and University College Dublin, together with other EU partners, have recently advanced the understanding of obesity and improved the ability to predict obesity-related complications. By communicating these concrete benefits on prosperity, health, safety, and scientific leadership, the Irish Presidency can help citizens understand that EU membership is not an abstract political project, but a shared endeavour that improves daily lives. Crucially, the Presidency contribute to ensure that these successes continue to be delivered in the future."

31,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/00f0555f/Individual_submission_-_Submission_31.docx,,Individual,Digital technologies,EU wide,1,"I believe the Irish presidency should focus on a ‘A Europe that delivers for all’ agenda. Considering Ireland’s unique island and land border situation, and the fact that the two other countries making up the trio are Lithuania and Greece, I believe Defence & Secure External Borders should be a key area of focus. This will provide continuity on a similar theme of the current trio of presidencies, hopefully leading to some long lasting achievements. However, the focus must remain on the EU and it’s capabilities, and should not include NATO. A second area of focus has to be Affordability. This particularly applies to housing, an area that every European country is struggling to address. The widespread nature of this issue means that if the Irish presidency can help move the needle on it, it would be everlasting. Tackling this issue requires bold ideas beyond just making apartments smaller or limiting short term lets. Thirdly, Digital Competitiveness & Security. Ireland is home to many major tech players, which has benefited the Irish state greatly, but has, I believe, had a negative impact on the EU as a whole. In this era of AI and Quantum, it is time for Europe to become competitive. The building blocks are there, we need to create the environment in which they can thrive. In particular, developing AI that actually improves the lives of European citizens, rather than just lining the pockets of industry leaders will require strong commitment across the EU as a whole. Strong government leadership will be required to prevent the watering down of AI and Privacy regulation and I think Ireland is in a strong position to take such a role. This theme is also intertwined with the theme of Defence & Secure External Borders as cyber security is becoming an increasingly critical area for the EU to address, as evidenced by, for example, the relatively recent ransomware attack on Irish healthcare institutions."
31,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/00f0555f/Individual_submission_-_Submission_31.docx,,Individual,Digital technologies,EU wide,2,"Ensuring alignment and agreement across the multiple pieces of legislation related to Digital Competitiveness & Security, primarily the Cloud and AI Development Act, the Chips Act, the AI Act, the Quantum Act, and the recently announced digital omnibus to simplify and streamline rules, will be crucial to their success. Ireland, as the primary host of multinational tech companies in the Union, has the skills, knowledge, and position to promote this alignment. It is also an opportunity for Ireland to show it is committed to the growth and success of the European tech ecosystem, regardless of any impact that may have on the American tech companies it hosts. Regarding Affordability, although the Commission’s work programme for 2026 in this area is unambitious in my opinion, the ‘initiative on short term rentals’ and any initiatives resulting from the ‘anti-poverty strategy’ must be prioritised. The lack of affordable housing EU wide is one of, if not the biggest, issue facing citizens of the Union. It has to be addressed through determination and ambition, putting regular people at the centre. Defence has long been a controversial subject in Ireland given our neutrality, but I don’t believe this neutrality means we shouldn’t be able to adequately defend ourselves, especially when we consider the criticality of the undersea cables within our territorial waters. Under the Defence & Secure External Borders theme, the initiatives for ‘Strengthening Frontex’ and ‘Simplifying defence and sensitive security procurement’ should receive focus. Ireland also needs to improve it’s national defence and security situation so an increased focus on knowledge and capabilities sharing from other EU member states is encouraged."
31,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/00f0555f/Individual_submission_-_Submission_31.docx,,Individual,Digital technologies,EU wide,4,"People need to understand what is being done for them to be able to feel they are part of it. Often, the work at the EU level is too abstract for average citizens to relate to so I believe simplifying the messaging is important. It is also important to relate the work of the Council during Ireland’s presidency to what matters most to the Irish people, and other EU citizens, such as affordable housing and border security. The messaging should also be spread across different media, allowing as many people as possible to access it. The messaging needs to be results oriented. People don’t care about what the Council or other institutions are trying to do if there aren’t any tangible results at the end. When it comes to politics, “Do or do not. There is no try”."
268,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/7e1d4671/Roche_-_Submission_268.docx,Roche,,,,1,"The 2026 Presidency occurs at a critical juncture for the European Union. The life sciences sector, a cornerstone of Europe’s economy and societal well-being, faces profound challenges to its global competitiveness. Over the last two decades, Europe’s share of global R&D investment has fallen by a quarter, with investment flowing to more competitive destinations like the United States and China. This trend directly impacts European patients, who face longer waits for innovative medicines and have fewer opportunities to participate in clinical trials. To address this, Ireland has an opportunity to champion a compelling and cohesive vision. We recommend that Ireland adopt the following overarching theme for its Presidency: ""Better Health, Stronger Europe: Investing in Resilience and Innovation"" This theme directly connects the EU’s long-term economic prosperity and strategic autonomy with the health and well-being of its citizens. It provides a strong narrative for why a thriving life sciences ecosystem is not just an industrial goal but a societal necessity. This vision can be built upon three strategic pillars: Driving Competitiveness for Better Health Outcomes: Enhancing Europe’s life sciences ecosystem is a prerequisite for delivering faster, more equitable access to innovative medicines and for expanding opportunities for citizens to participate in cutting-edge clinical trials. The Presidency should champion the view that healthcare spending is a strategic investment in societal resilience and economic productivity, not simply a cost to be contained. Strengthening Strategic Resilience: True resilience is the capacity of the EU’s health systems and supply chains to anticipate and absorb shocks. This means ensuring the security of medicine supply, leveraging digital infrastructure to monitor public health threats, and diversifying manufacturing to prepare for future challenges without resorting to protectionist measures. Accelerating Patient-Centred Innovation: The Presidency must place the patient at the heart of its agenda. This involves translating scientific breakthroughs into tangible benefits by improving regulatory pathways, embracing the potential of digital health and the European Health Data Space, and decisively tackling unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, rare diseases, and neurological conditions. By framing its priorities around this central theme, the Irish Presidency can champion a positive, forward-looking agenda that aligns the EU’s industrial, health, and research policies toward a common, citizen-focused goal."
268,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/7e1d4671/Roche_-_Submission_268.docx,Roche,,,,2,"The legislative agenda for the Irish Presidency will be substantially shaped by inherited files from the outgoing Trio presidencies. Within this context, Ireland has a crucial opportunity to provide leadership and steer key proposals toward outcomes that foster innovation, competitiveness, and patient access. The Presidency should focus on two primary legislative priorities. Future-Proofing the EU's Life Sciences Ecosystem EU Biotech Act: This Act should be a flagship priority for the Irish Presidency, championed as a critical simplification instrument. Ireland’s goal should be to ensure the legislation strengthens the EU’s intellectual property (IP) framework, simplifies and harmonises clinical trial authorisations through measures like a single portal for core document submission and a harmonised approach to ethical reviews, and creates seamless end-to-end regulatory oversight. A well-designed Biotech Act will make the EU a more attractive and predictable destination for high-value investment in research and advanced manufacturing. Revision of the Pharmaceutical Legislation: This represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernise the EU’s regulatory environment. The Irish Presidency should work to ensure the implementation of the legislation. Targeted Revision of the Medical Devices & IVD Regulations: While pharmaceutical reform is vital, the Irish Presidency must also address the critical bottlenecks in the diagnostics sector. We recommend that Ireland prioritize the targeted revision of the IVDR and MDR to streamline certification processes. A functioning diagnostics market is the foundation of the entire health ecosystem; without tests, there are no diagnoses, and without diagnoses, there is no treatment. Multiannual Financial Framework: The EU’s budget plays an important role in realizing the competitiveness agenda and health and life science policy priorities. In this context, the multiannual financial framework (MFF) is particularly important, with regard to the negotiations for the forthcoming MFF 2028-2034. Ensuring Timely and Equitable Patient Access Ireland should leverage its significant manufacturing credibility to guide legislation toward its intended purpose: genuine supply resilience. The Presidency should champion key elements such as real-time shortage alerts, diversified manufacturing, and risk-based assessments of vulnerabilities. It is critical to avoid protectionist measures like local-production requirements, which risk fragmenting global supply chains and undermining competitiveness. Implementation of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Regulation: With joint clinical assessments now underway since January 2025, the Irish Presidency should promote the swift and effective implementation of the HTA Regulation. The aim must be to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and timely process for evaluating clinical evidence. This will reduce duplicative processes across Member States, minimise delays, and accelerate patient access to proven innovations. By successfully advancing these legislative files, the Irish Presidency can deliver a lasting legacy that strengthens Europe’s health security, boosts its industrial competitiveness, and, most importantly, improves health outcomes for millions of citizens."
268,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/7e1d4671/Roche_-_Submission_268.docx,Roche,,,,3,"The ultimate success of the Irish Presidency will be measured by its ability to demonstrate how high-level EU strategy delivers concrete benefits for citizens’ health, economic security, and community well-being. Beyond advancing specific legislative files, Ireland can make a substantial impact by spearheading a high-level strategic initiative. We recommend that Ireland champion the creation of a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce as a key priority for the Irish Presidency, bringing together the European Commission, Member States, and industry partners. This Taskforce should pursue two core objectives. First, it should deliver a bold, high-level Political Declaration during the Irish Presidency that reaffirms the strategic importance of Europe's research-based pharmaceutical sector and the EU's collective commitment to invest in its future. Second, it must translate this political commitment into tangible action by developing a selection of five key benchmarking ‘innovation’ indicators that enable progress to be tracked at both national and EU level in the years ahead, ensuring accountability long after the Presidency concludes. This initiative would anchor the Presidency's work in delivering tangible benefits across several key areas: Faster Access to Innovation: By working to streamline regulatory and reimbursement pathways, the Presidency can directly reduce the time patients must wait for life-changing treatments. This is particularly critical for those living with cancer, rare diseases, and other serious conditions where time is of the essence. Turning the Tide on Cancer through Early Detection: Treatment is only half the battle. The Presidency should drive the full implementation of the EU Council Recommendations on Cancer Screening. By championing the rollout of lung, prostate, and gastric cancer screening programs across Member States, Ireland can help shift European healthcare systems from a model of ""sick care"" to true ""preventative health,"" saving lives and reducing long-term costs. Driving Regional Prosperity: A competitive and thriving life sciences sector supports high-quality, sustainable jobs and investment in communities across Europe, well beyond major urban centres. Ireland’s own distributed ecosystem is a prime example of this positive regional impact, which the Presidency can showcase as a model for Europe. Empowering Patients through Digital Health: Championing the effective and interoperable implementation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) will empower patients with greater control over their own health data, improve care coordination between providers, and create unprecedented opportunities to accelerate research and discovery. Operationalize the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan As Chair of the Council, Ireland is uniquely positioned to steer Member State discussions toward the concrete implementation of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. We encourage the Presidency to guide the Council toward a consensus on prioritizing secondary prevention, specifically by facilitating agreement on EU-wide early detection standards and ""Heart Health Checks."" By leading these critical discussions, Ireland can drive a coordinated EU response to reduce preventable mortality and healthcare costs. By focusing on these practical outcomes, the Presidency can build a powerful narrative that connects its work in Brussels and Luxembourg to the daily lives of people, businesses, and communities across the Union."
268,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/7e1d4671/Roche_-_Submission_268.docx,Roche,,,,4,"Effective communication requires moving beyond technical policy discussions to build a clear, compelling, and relatable narrative that connects the Presidency's work with the daily lives and concerns of European citizens. This requires a people-centric message and tangible examples of the EU's positive impact. To achieve this, we recommend adopting a clear and simple narrative for the Presidency, such as: ""Our Health, Our Future: Delivering for Europe’s Citizens"" This framing directly links the benefits of EU cooperation—a cornerstone of Ireland’s own modern history—with visible, positive outcomes in healthcare, economic security, and innovation that resonate with citizens. It transforms the abstract concept of EU policy into a shared goal of improved well-being for all. To build a sense of public ownership, this narrative should be supported by concrete communication strategies: Showcase Tangible Benefits: Use digital storytelling and media engagement to highlight practical examples of EU action. Feature stories on earlier cancer diagnoses made possible by EU research, secure medicine supplies during a crisis, or improved access to vaccines for families and communities. This makes the benefits of EU membership personal and relatable. Facilitate Patient-Centred Dialogue: Organise a series of patient roundtables and citizen dialogues to highlight the lived experiences of those directly affected by health policy. Ensuring the voices of patients are heard and integrated into the Presidency's work will make the process more inclusive and demonstrate a genuine commitment to public engagement. By adopting this approach, Ireland can communicate the value of the EU in a way that is authentic, impactful, and builds a strong sense of national and European pride in the Presidency’s mission."

This summary should also be limited to a maximum of 500 words. For Ireland to lead the European life sciences agenda with credibility, it must first articulate its own clear national vision. Therefore, our single most critical recommendation is that Ireland seize a unique and time-sensitive opportunity to reinforce its leadership credentials ahead of its Presidency. The Case for a National Life Sciences Strategy We strongly recommend that the Irish Government publish an ambitious National Life Sciences Strategy before the Presidency begins in the second half of 2026. Taking this proactive step is essential. It will provide Ireland with the strategic clarity, policy framework, and international credibility required to shape EU priorities. By publishing its own strategy, Ireland can move beyond its formal role as a neutral and honest broker to become an informed and exemplary broker, leading the EU by example. An Irish strategy aligned with the EU's own ambitions will serve as a powerful blueprint for other Member States. Based on our extensive engagement and analysis, we believe this national strategy should be built upon three strategic pillars: Fostering Enterprise: A focus on growing indigenous companies, sustaining high-value Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and protecting Ireland's world-class advanced manufacturing base to ensure a resilient and innovative industrial ecosystem. Innovation Uptake: A commitment to accelerate patient access to new medicines and diagnostics, reform procurement to focus on value, and expand the clinical trial ecosystem to establish Ireland as an ""Early Launch Market"" for cutting-edge therapies. Research, Data & Digital: A vision to position Ireland as a global hub for life sciences research and a leader in the adoption of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) and other digital health innovations that can transform care delivery and R&D. By launching a National Life Sciences Strategy, Ireland can champion its Presidency theme of ""Better Health, Stronger Europe"" with unmatched authority and authenticity. It will send an unmistakable signal that Ireland is not just chairing the EU agenda, but is actively leading by example. Roche is fully committed to partnering with the Irish government to help deliver a successful Presidency that yields lasting benefits for patients and reinforces the vital connection between Better Health and a Stronger Europe."

The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside other challenges such as geopolitical tensions, energy-supply disruptions, and extreme weather events like floods, wildfires, and droughts, has underscored the importance of building a resilient Union. By strengthening its ability to anticipate, respond to, and recover from a wide range of shocks, the EU can better safeguard its citizens, economies, and essential services. In this context, investing in public health prevention is a key element of preparedness and resilience. In a world of rising health threats and mounting pressure on health systems, the EU has a clear opportunity and responsibility to lead on preparedness by reinforcing investment in public health prevention. One aspect of this is the prevention and mitigation of respiratory infections. This is not only a public health priority but also a vital component of EU resilience, safeguarding citizens, economies, and essential services from the destabilising effects of large-scale outbreaks. Investing in prevention is a critical part of promoting global health security preparedness, as infectious diseases know no borders. As other global actors reduce their long-term public health investments, the EU can step forward to fill the gap and champion a model of long-term resilience. To match the scale of today’s challenges and address the reality of respiratory infections, some with pandemic potential, EU action is needed. These infections can not only overwhelm healthcare systems, but also disrupt essential services, and undermine workforce capacity and economic stability. Indeed, respiratory infections (influenza, COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)), and pneumococcal disease) are among the most serious public health threats facing Europe. Across the EU, respiratory infections are the leading cause of comorbidities, hospitalisation, and death. These infections can overwhelm healthcare systems, disrupt essential services, and undermine workforce capacity and economic stability. Immunisation against respiratory infections is a proven, cost-effective tool that strengthens strategic autonomy, reducing economic losses and reliance on emergency measures and external supplies during crises. Safe and effective immunisation tools are available, and the prevention of severe outcomes is both feasible and cost effective. A comprehensive EU approach will save lives, protect economic productivity, and maintain public trust while ensuring that the EU is prepared for future cross-border health threats. Now is the time for the EU to take responsibility and act decisively to protect the health and security of its citizens."
64,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/68badb3f/Secretariat_of_the_Steering_Group_on_Prevention_of_Respiratory_Infections_-_Submission_64.docx,Secretariat of the Steering Group on Prevention of Respiratory Infections,NGO,Healthcare,"EU wide, with relevance at national level across EU-27 Member States",2,"During its Presidency, Ireland should prioritise the prevention of respiratory infections (such as seasonal influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal diseases, and RSV) as a key European health challenge within the larger framework of respiratory health prevention. Ireland is uniquely positioned to drive this agenda among Member States, leading by example with its own national experience. Ireland’s preventive respiratory health leadership is long established. In 2004, it became the first country in the world to ban indoor smoking in workplaces, paving the way for similar policies across Europe and marking a major milestone in respiratory health policy. This pioneering move set a global precedent, significantly improved indoor air quality, and lowering rates of smoking-related respiratory illness. Ireland is also a leader in influenza vaccination and public confidence in vaccination, demonstrating its experience, success and credibility in public health prevention and respiratory health. Respiratory infections remain among the most serious public health threats facing Europe and improved uptake of existing vaccines could substantially reduce the burdens associated with these infections in Europe. However, despite the availability of effective immunisation methods, immunisation coverage remains below target in many EU countries and existing EU frameworks are no longer fit for purpose. The 2009 Council Recommendation on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination represents an important step but is now insufficient to address the scale and complexity of today’s respiratory health challenges, which urgently require a broader (beyond influenza) and more ambitious approach. Given the clear cross-border implications of respiratory infections, EU-level action is essential. In this context, the Steering Group welcomes the intention of the European Commission to develop new Council Recommendation on vaccination against respiratory infections as a preventive measure for cardiovascular disease as a flagship initiative within its forthcoming Cardiovascular Health Plan. We believe that the Irish Presidency is well-placed to lead the way in generating political momentum ahead of such Recommendations, drawing on the successes of its own national experience, to elevate respiratory health within the EU health political agenda. This focus would also align with other Irish health priorities, including the revision of the EU’s tobacco legislation, under the broader umbrella of promoting respiratory health, and more broadly with EU priorities, such as strengthening EU resilience, improving access to critical medicines, and completing the European Health Union. By championing comprehensive respiratory and immunisation policy, Ireland could host a high-level conference during its Presidency, engaging stakeholders from across the EU to reinforce the importance of action. Achieving this would be a meaningful accomplishment of the Irish Presidency and leave an important legacy in public health."
64,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/68badb3f/Secretariat_of_the_Steering_Group_on_Prevention_of_Respiratory_Infections_-_Submission_64.docx,Secretariat of the Steering Group on Prevention of Respiratory Infections,NGO,Healthcare,"EU wide, with relevance at national level across EU-27 Member States",3,"Respiratory infections are among the most common infectious diseases in Europe, and many of their most serious consequences are preventable. Infections such as RSV, pneumococcal disease, COVID-19 and influenza pose a significant and evolving threat to public health in Europe, affecting a range of at-risk groups including older adults, young children, pregnant people and those with underlying health conditions such as chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic or kidney diseases. Their cumulative burden, combined with rising health threats and mounting pressure on health systems, underlines the urgent need for stronger prevention and preparedness. The benefits of immunisation extend beyond merely reducing disease severity. Immunisation also plays an important preventive role in lowering the risk of exacerbation and initiation of non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases. For example, immunisation against respiratory infections has been shown to lower the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. Meanwhile, at least 70% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are infectious in origin, with respiratory infections identified in approximately 30% of cases. Immunisation also plays a critical role in addressing the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance by helping to prevent the emergence and transmission of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive infections and lower antibiotic use. However, significant disparities in healthy life expectancy and vaccine uptake remain across Europe, correlating with socioeconomic factors and varying levels of healthcare access, with persisting barriers in Central and Eastern Europe. 15 years after the publication of the Council Recommendation on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination, the EU is still lagging behind in immunisation against respiratory infections. In 2023-2024, the median vaccination rate for influenza among older adults in the EU was only 45.7%, compared to the target of 75%. Meanwhile, in 2023-24 just 12% of adults aged 60 and above received a COVID-19 vaccine. For older adults aged 60-69, most reporting countries fell below 35%. By prioritising prevention of respiratory infections among its health priorities, the Irish Presidency can help promote healthier lives and better outcomes for citizens and communities across the EU. It can also contribute to European economic competitiveness and resilience by reducing healthcare costs, preventing productivity losses, helping workforces remain healthy and efficient, supporting economic growth and limiting absenteeism. By keeping populations healthy, immunisation also reduces pressure on healthcare systems and reinforces economic security across Europe. Adult immunisation programmes can return up to 19 times their initial investment and in the case of pneumococcal immunisation – 33 times. Annual seasonal influenza immunisation can save up to €332 million in healthcare costs in Europe by preventing hospitalisations and visits to general practitioners. Together, prioritising prevention of respiratory infections can help ensure equitable access to preventive measures across all Member States, particularly for vulnerable populations, and send a strong signal of renewed EU commitment to disease prevention, health system resilience, and preparedness."
64,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/68badb3f/Secretariat_of_the_Steering_Group_on_Prevention_of_Respiratory_Infections_-_Submission_64.docx,Secretariat of the Steering Group on Prevention of Respiratory Infections,NGO,Healthcare,"EU wide, with relevance at national level across EU-27 Member States",4,"The EU has both the opportunity and responsibility to lead by investing in long-term preparedness and resilience. Immunisation is a proven, cost-effective tool to protect citizens, safeguard economies and build capacity in responding to emergencies. Despite overwhelming evidence that immunisation saves lives, prevents hospitalisations, increases preparedness and reduces healthcare costs, inconsistent immunisation coverage across Member States continues to leave millions unprotected. Highlighting successes in this area and addressing vaccine hesitancy can make the benefits of EU-level action tangible and relatable for EU citizens. To foster a sense of citizen ownership over Ireland’s EU Presidency, communication should emphasise how EU initiatives—like a proposed Council Recommendation on immunisation against respiratory infections—directly benefit people’s lives. Ireland can engage EU citizens by showcasing its national experience as a model for EU-wide action, demonstrating how policies developed at the EU level can be adapted to diverse health systems. Ireland is one of Europe’s leaders in immunisation and should lead as an example during its EU Presidency. This leadership position has been established through a combination of high vaccine uptake, evidence-driven decision-making, and early adoption of new preventive measures. As mentioned previously, Ireland has historically been a champion in prevention in respiratory health, including through consistently meeting the World Health Organization’s 75% target for flu vaccine uptake among older adults. This strong track record positions Ireland to lead EU efforts on respiratory infection prevention. Ireland is well positioned to lead the effort to promote prevention across Europe, which aligns closely with its national priorities through work at Council working party level. The Department of Health’s Statement of Strategy 2023–2025 identifies pandemic preparedness and public health promotion - particularly through strengthened screening and immunisation - as a top strategic priority. Similarly, Objective 5 of the HSE Health Protection Strategy 2022–2027 focuses on immunisation, including enhancing prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases across population groups. Ireland is also pioneering in this area through its recently expanded RSV immunisation programme for infants - one of the first of its kind in Europe. Its example could be highly impactful for other EU countries, demonstrating how preventive strategies can be scaled and adapted across different health systems. With a Council Recommendation on the value of immunisation against respiratory infections, the EU could provide support to Member States, including Ireland, towards improved prevention measures. This could include support by the European Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in building capacity and infrastructure for improved disease surveillance and vaccination coverage reporting. Together, this can promote enhanced health resilience, stronger health systems, and improved health outcomes for all EU citizens. Building trust in the EU, and vaccines, relies on making the case for how they improve their everyday lives and providing clear and accessible information about how not only how they function, but add value to our societies – including by supporting resilience and preparedness. By acting on this pressing public health issue, Ireland can help advance the wellbeing and safety of citizens across the EU during its Presidency."

This leadership is reflected in Ireland’s ambitious public health policies and its strong alignment with the EU Beating Cancer Plan. As Ireland prepares for the 2026 Presidency, continuing—and strengthening—this pioneering role offers a unique opportunity to distinguish itself and contribute to delivering a healthier, more resilient Europe. Priority 1: Advancing a Future-Oriented EU Public Health Agenda Ireland’s Presidency should champion a forward-looking public health agenda that supports the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and accelerates progress on the Beating Cancer Plan. To achieve Europe’s 2040 cancer objectives, the EU must make measurable progress on tobacco and nicotine regulation, including reforms under the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) and the Tobacco Tax Directive (TTD). Although it remains uncertain whether both directives will be fully tabled during Ireland’s Presidency, this moment provides an important political window. Ireland can use its Presidency to push for progress, set clear political direction, and ensure strong Council alignment on the importance of updated, evidence-based regulation. Updated tobacco and nicotine legislation—covering product standards, flavours, marketing, taxation, and monitoring—will be critical to protecting public health. Priority 2: Ending the Tobacco Epidemic and Addressing the Rapidly Growing Nicotine Market Ireland can position the EU at the forefront of tobacco endgame strategies—aimed at driving smoking prevalence to near-zero levels. Such an approach aligns strongly with the Beating Cancer Plan and with Ireland’s own longstanding leadership. Simultaneously, the EU faces an accelerating vaping and nicotine epidemic, with new products, flavours, and disposable devices expanding at a pace that outstrips current legislation. The nicotine industry is innovating rapidly and targeting young people aggressively. Ireland’s Presidency can elevate the urgency of modernising EU rules to address emerging nicotine products, reduce youth exposure, and strengthen cross-border enforcement. Priority 3: Protecting Children and Young People Across the EU A people-centred, future-oriented Presidency should focus on safeguarding children and young people from addictive substances and commercial determinants of health. Ireland can highlight the need for stronger measures on advertising, digital marketing, packaging, and availability—in alignment with the FCTC's MPOWER framework. Reducing early nicotine exposure is essential for Europe’s health and equity goals. Priority 4: A Fair, Health-Protective and Resilient Single Market Strong tobacco and nicotine regulation supports a competitive and fair Single Market, reduces health inequalities, and strengthens economic resilience. Updated TPD and TTD frameworks will provide clarity, protect consumers, and ensure coherent market rules across Member States. Conclusion By reinforcing its pioneering role and championing progress on the TPD and TTD, Ireland can make a measurable and lasting contribution during its 2026 Presidency. This aligns with the EU’s long-term vision while advancing the Beating Cancer Plan."

Ireland’s leadership in tobacco and nicotine control positions it to advance legislative files that will determine whether the EU can meet its 2040 cancer and health equity targets. Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation: Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) Revision The TPD revision should be a central focus of the Irish Presidency. Even if the TPD formally falls outside its remit, this period provides a strategic opportunity to push for progress, accelerate discussions, and set strong political direction. The rapid evolution of the nicotine market—including vaping products, nicotine pouches, flavour innovations, and disposable devices—requires a modernised framework that keeps pace with industry tactics targeting young people. The Irish Presidency should aim to: Support ambitious Council positions on product standards, flavour bans, packaging rules, and digital marketing restrictions. Strengthen provisions on nicotine and emerging products, including phased restrictions or bans targeting youth. Advance cross-border enforcement to ensure consistent implementation across Member States. Uphold Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC to prevent tobacco industry interference and safeguard evidence-based policy. Tobacco Tax Directive (TTD): Closing Gaps and Preventing Youth Uptake Modernising the TTD is essential to reduce affordability, a key driver of youth tobacco and nicotine use. The Irish Presidency can: Advocate taxation frameworks covering all nicotine products, including emerging ones. Support minimum tax levels to reduce price gaps between traditional tobacco and alternatives. Strengthen links between fiscal measures and cancer prevention objectives. A robust TTD also promotes a fairer and more coherent Single Market. Protecting Children and Young People Youth protection should remain a priority across all Council configurations. Ireland can champion stronger measures on advertising, online promotion, packaging, retailer licensing, and school-based prevention — including holding digital platforms such as Snapchat accountable for the promotion and visibility of nicotine products. Strengthening Europe’s Public Health Architecture Ireland can reinforce Europe’s chronic disease prevention capacity through improved data collection, monitoring industry tactics, and addressing commercial determinants of health. These measures support both the Beating Cancer Plan and EU resilience goals. International Coordination and COP12 Ireland’s Presidency, in coordination with its Trio partners Lithuania and Greece, will align its priorities with international developments, including COP12 outcomes. Relevant policy and legislative objectives will be reflected in both national and Trio programmes. The evolution of the Council’s legislative agenda through the Danish and Cypriot Presidencies will further shape Ireland’s engagement with COP12 priorities, ensuring the EU can respond effectively in areas where coordinated action is needed. Conclusion By prioritising ambitious action on the TPD and TTD, strengthening youth protection, enforcing Article 5.3, and supporting a modern public health architecture, Ireland can play a decisive role in shaping a healthier, future-oriented European Union during its 2026 Presidency."

Ireland’s track record in public health and tobacco control demonstrates how ambitious leadership can set standards that later become the norm across the EU. Healthier People and Communities By promoting prevention and health protection, the Presidency can reduce disease, improve wellbeing, and empower citizens to make healthier choices. Prioritising youth protection and chronic disease prevention ensures long-term benefits for families and communities while reducing pressure on health systems. Supporting businesses and fair markets Clear and harmonised EU policies provide certainty for businesses and encourage responsible innovation. Consistent standards on product safety, marketing, and taxation enable businesses—especially small and medium-sized enterprises—to operate on a level playing field while contributing to healthier societies. Reducing inequalities Policies targeting health disparities and protecting young people from harmful products strengthen social cohesion and community resilience. Integrating health, education, and social initiatives ensures benefits are widely and equitably shared across populations.

Ireland should also advance sustainable agri-food systems that protect and promote biodiversity, enhance animal welfare, and contribute to reducing the country’s climate emissions. Ireland has embedded the One Health One Welfare approach across key policies, providing a strong foundation for its EU Council Presidency. The Animal Welfare Strategy 2021–2025 and 2026–2030 consultation materials, national Animal Health Surveillance and Biosecurity strategies, iNAP plans, and agri-food strategies like Food Vision all reflect this holistic approach, recognising the interdependence of human wellbeing, animal welfare, and environmental health. Through further expansion of the One Health One Welfare concept, Ireland has the opportunity to provide leadership in policy areas where citizens expect ambitious action by promoting coherent, humane and sustainable policy across animal welfare, public health, environmental protection, and food-system resilience. General Principles Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise animal welfare as a core element of sustainable and ethical EU agriculture. All animals deserve a life worth living, not merely freedom from suffering. Policy should aim to enable animals to express natural behaviours, enjoy social interactions, and experience physical and mental well-being.

The revision of the Animal Transport Regulation remains a major pending legislative file which Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise progress on. Key Recommendations Support science-based limits on journey times, tailored to species-specific tolerance thresholds. Include time spent on sea transport and roll-on/roll-off vessel crossings within total journey times, recognising the well-documented welfare risks inherent to these types of journeys Limit journey durations for vulnerable animals (pigs, poultry and pregnant animals). Phase out the live transport of unweaned calves, as evidence shows that welfare risks for this vulnerable group cannot be effectively mitigated even with regulation. As an immediate transitional step, the minimum transport age should be raised, with a longer-term goal of ending their export entirely. Phase out the live export of farm animals to non-EU countries lacking enforceable welfare standards. Evidence shows such transport causes severe stress, injury, disease, and death. The focus should shift to more humane and sustainable trade, such as exporting meat or genetic material instead of live animals. Prioritise transport of meat and carcasses over the long-distance movement of live animals. Ensure enforceable welfare requirements during transit to include sufficient space, ventilation, food, water, rest, and ability to express natural behaviours. Prohibit the transport of animals in extreme temperatures, or require mandatory heating and cooling systems that go beyond simple ventilation, ensuring stable internal conditions compatible with animals’ thermal needs Stronger regulations to assess fitness for transport to ensure that animals unfit to travel are not transported. Veterinary oversight and strict enforcement are essential. Promote digital traceability, harmonised enforcement, and real-time journey monitoring across all Member States. Include GPS tracking, and inspection at departure, during transit, and on arrival. Require Member States to report transport statistics, inspections, and penalties for non-compliance. Strengthen competency requirements for transporters and official veterinarians. Provide financial and logistical assistance to implement higher standards without economic disadvantage. Progress the Revision of On-Farm Animal Welfare Legislation The European Commission has committed to revising multiple pieces of on-farm legislation (laying hens, broilers, pigs, dairy cattle, rabbits, fish and others). This supports the EC’s long-term ambition for sustainable food systems, climate resilience, and higher animal welfare as recognised under One Health, One Welfare. Ireland’s Presidency should support the revision of on-farm welfare rules to ensure animals are kept in conditions that promote their health and well-being. Key Recommendations Support a phased EU-wide transition away from cages for all farmed species including sow stalls, farrowing crates and barren cages. Strengthen species-specific welfare requirements for all farmed animals including aquatic animals, including space allowances, enrichment, no mutilations and outdoor access to enable animals to move freely and express natural behaviours. Regulate for mandatory welfare audits, veterinary inspections, and farm-specific welfare plans. Improve traceability and record-keeping through digital records integrated across EU databases linking welfare, health, and transport data. Incentives for higher welfare through EU funding for improved systems and welfare-friendly labelling schemes. Ensure welfare assessments are embedded within CAP strategic planning and environmental/climate funding instruments. Re-instate the mandate for EFSA animal welfare opinions on farmed aquatic animals and invertebrates. Promote sustainable aquaculture development including by applying the precautionary principle and attaching animal welfare criteria to the disbursement of EU funding for aquaculture and promoting low trophic species and practices."

A phrase such as “A Healthier, Fairer, and More Resilient Europe” would align with the Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and reflect Ireland’s commitment to equity, wellbeing, and innovation. Three broad thematic priorities could guide the Presidency’s policy focus. 1. Prevention and Improved Management of Chronic Health Conditions Promoting prevention and early intervention is essential to reducing avoidable disability, maintaining quality of life, supporting independent living, and mitigating long-term pressures on health and social systems. Chronic conditions such as chronic pain affect 1 in 5 adults in Europe – 1 in 3 people in Ireland (35% of all adults) – and is strongly associated with reduced quality of life, poorer mental health, and social isolation. In addition, the cost of chronic pain in Ireland is over €5 billion per year, almost 3% of GDP. A focus on primary prevention (avoiding preventable pain and injury) and secondary prevention (timely diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation) would support EU efforts on cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, workplace health and mental health. For Ireland, this aligns with national priorities to improve access, reduce waiting lists, and promote community-based care. Improving the management of chronic pain—through earlier diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, and evidence-based treatment pathways—can further reduce disability, and long-term economic impact on health and social systems. 2. Enhancing Europe’s Research and Innovation Capacity to Address High-Burden Societal Challenges Scientific research and innovation are central to the EU’s competitiveness and preparedness for future health and social needs. Strategic investment in health research helps address areas that impose a high burden on European citizens and economies. Health research also functions as a public good, delivering long-term societal value by improving prevention, treatment and system resilience. This aim is also very compatible with Ireland’s strong reputation in education and a knowledge-driven economy. Despite affecting more than 100 million Europeans, chronic pain remains under-researched compared with other major health challenges. The Pain Research Strategy (PRiSE) offers a coordinated roadmap for strengthening pain research across Europe, supporting innovation, informing clinical practice, and improving rehabilitation and treatment pathways. PRiSE illustrates how investment in under-researched areas generates advances across neuroscience, rehabilitation, mental health, digital health, and health-services research, delivering meaningful societal and economic returns. 3. Supporting Employment, Economic Participation, and Healthy Working Lives Across Europe Ensuring that individuals can participate in economic and social life is fundamental for the EU’s resilience. Chronic conditions like chronic pain – one of the leading contributors to absenteeism and reduced productivity—affect people’s ability to remain in or return to work. In Ireland, chronic pain has a substantial economic impact, with 12% of affected individuals unable to work or needing to reduce their working hours. Further, people with chronic pain are three times more likely to be unemployed. A Presidency theme centred on economic participation and healthy working lives would enhace inclusive employment policies, rehabilitation pathways, workplace wellbeing initiatives, while supporting social fairness, competitiveness, and digital transformation."

Prevention and Improved Management of Chronic Health Conditions Strengthening prevention and early intervention is essential to improving quality of life and reducing long-term pressures on health and social systems. Chronic conditions such as chronic pain—which affects 1 in 5 adults in Europe and 35% of all adults in Ireland—demonstrate the importance of both primary prevention (avoiding preventable pain and injury) and secondary prevention (timely diagnosis, adequate treatment, and rehabilitation). Improved management of chronic pain—through multidisciplinary care, accessible treatment pathways, and better integration of pain services into national health strategies—would reduce disability, enhance patient outcomes, and alleviate the burden on health and social systems across the EU. What Ireland could aim to achieve: Adoption of Council Conclusions on Primary and Secondary Prevention, promoting coordinated EU action on early diagnosis, rehabilitation, and chronic disease management. A Health Council Policy Debate on integrating prevention approaches into national health strategies, highlighting the wide social and economic impact of chronic conditions. These steps would reinforce existing EU priorities while advancing a coherent prevention agenda across Member States. 2. Strengthening EU Research and Innovation – Including a Coordinated Agenda for Pain Research The next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2028–2034) will determine Europe’s research priorities for the coming decade. Ireland’s Presidency is well placed to contribute to early debates, especially regarding the alignment of research investments with high-burden societal challenges. Chronic pain remains one of the most prevalent health issues in Europe, yet historically has been significantly underfunded in EU programmes. Strengthening EU investment in health research is essential not only for advancing innovation but for addressing major challenges—such as non-communicable diseases and mental health—where research acts as a public good that provides long-term value for all Member States. What Ireland could aim to achieve: A Council Debate on Research Priorities for the Next MFF, emphasising the need to direct funding toward high-burden areas that have traditionally received limited investment—such as chronic pain. Approaches like PRiSE provide clear, evidence-based guidance on how coordinated EU action can close research gaps in prevention, diagnosis, rehabilitation, and innovative treatment pathways. Advancement of implementation discussions on the European Health Data Space, particularly regarding the adoption of internationally harmonised classification and coding systems—such as ICD-11—to improve the consistency, comparability, and clinical utility of health data. 3. Employment, Economic Participation, and Healthy Working Lives Promoting participation in the labour market is central to Europe’s economic and social sustainability. Chronic conditions—such as chronic pain, a leading contributor to absenteeism and reduced productivity—create barriers to employment. In Ireland, the PRIME Study shows that chronic pain substantially increases the likelihood of work disruption and depression – as high as 15% in the latter – highlighting the importance of rehabilitation and workplace supports. What Ireland could aim to achieve: Adoption of Council Conclusions on Healthy Working Lives, focusing on rehabilitation, return-to-work pathways, workplace wellbeing, and inclusive employment policies. A Joint EPSCO–Health Council Debate on the socioeconomic impact of chronic conditions and their relevance for labour-market participation."

Highlighting EU initiatives that address real-life challenges, such as access to quality healthcare, research into under-prioritised conditions like chronic pain, support for people living with long-term illness or disability, workplace wellbeing, and protections for vulnerable groups, can make the EU’s role tangible and relatable. Ireland’s Presidency can foster a sense of ownership by showing how the EU helps ensure that no community faces these challenges alone: through shared investment in research, cross-border health cooperation, coordinated disease prevention, and policies that help individuals stay active in work and social life despite chronic conditions. Communicating honestly about the Presidency’s goals and progress, using clear language and real stories from patients, carers, healthcare professionals, and families, can build trust and strengthen citizens’ connection with the EU. Engaging civil-society organisations, patient groups, community networks, and those affected by chronic conditions provides citizens who often feel unheard with a meaningful role in shaping Ireland’s contribution to the Union’s agenda. By bringing these voices into the conversation—and by showing how EU membership enables practical improvements in health, wellbeing, inclusion, and economic participation—Ireland can create a Presidency that not only reflects European values but is recognised by citizens as directly relevant to their daily lives and future prospects."

These documents illustrate areas where coordinated European action can generate substantial public-health and socioeconomic benefits. The SIP Book of Evidence on the Burden of Pain was created for individuals from a non-scientific background to gain an insight into what pain is, understand the different definitions used, and the debilitating effects pain has on patients and societies. he EFIC Pain Research Strategy (PRiSE) provides an evidence-based roadmap for strengthening pain research in Europe. It identifies major gaps in current funding, sets priority areas for investment, and recommends mechanisms to align research efforts with societal burden and clinical need. PRiSE highlights the importance of multidisciplinary work, better integration of basic and clinical science, and improved data infrastructure to support prevention, diagnosis, rehabilitation, and treatment. It also underscores that chronic pain—affecting 1 in 5 Europeans—remains significantly under-researched despite its wide impact on wellbeing, employment, and public expenditure. The SIP Position Paper on Preventive Healthcare for Chronic Pain sets out policy recommendations for strengthening both primary and secondary prevention. It highlights the need for early intervention, better access to rehabilitation, and integrated care pathways to reduce the transition from acute to chronic pain and support quality of life. The paper also places pain prevention within wider EU priorities—healthy ageing, mental health, musculoskeletal health, and workplace wellbeing—showing how coordinated prevention strategies can improve outcomes and reduce pressure on health and social systems. The SIP Position Paper on ICD-11 underscores the importance of adopting the WHO’s latest international classification system across EU Member States. It explains how ICD-11 enables clearer and more clinically relevant coding for chronic pain and other long-term conditions, supporting accurate data collection, improved health-system planning, cross-border comparability, and stronger research foundations. This is especially relevant to the European Health Data Space, which foresees harmonised international coding systems to enhance data quality and interoperability across the Union.

These respond directly to the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and reflect urgent challenges shared across Member States. A Water-Resilient, Climate-Adapted Europe Water scarcity, extreme weather, ageing infrastructure and rising industrial demand increasingly constrain Europe’s economic development. Ireland is well placed—reputable, practical and experiencing its own water-capacity pressures—to elevate water resilience as a core pillar of the EU agenda. Priorities should include delivering the Water Resilience Strategy, accelerating digitalisation of water systems, and promoting circular water use across municipalities and industry. This is foundational for climate adaptation, competitiveness and public health. Competitiveness Through Industrial Energy and Water Efficiency Europe cannot compete globally without reducing its structural input costs. Energy efficiency remains Europe’s “first fuel”, and industrial pumping systems alone account for a significant share of electricity use. Water systems are also major energy consumers for municipalities. Ireland can champion a Presidency theme centred on resource efficiency as an industrial strategy, encouraging deployment of high-efficiency technologies, digital monitoring systems, process optimisation and circular water models. This theme sits naturally between COMPET, ENVI and ECOFIN priorities. Modern, Digital Infrastructure for Europe’s Future Growth Europe faces pronounced under-investment in water infrastructure, with an estimated €23bn/year financing gap. Ireland’s own national agenda—housing expansion, industrial investment and infrastructure upgrades—mirrors this EU-wide challenge. A Presidency focus on modernisation and digitalisation of water and wastewater systems would enable improved resilience, lower operating costs, stronger environmental performance, and enhanced service reliability for citizens. Taken together, these themes frame Ireland’s Presidency as forward-looking, citizen-focused and competitiveness-driven, while fully aligned with the Union’s broader priorities. The Presidency can present water and energy efficiency not as environmental add-ons, but as strategic levers for Europe’s economic strength and climate resilience."

This includes: A detailed implementation roadmap with milestones. Embedding “Water Efficiency First” across relevant industrial, energy and digital policy files. Strengthening incentives for industrial water reuse, cascading water systems and digital water monitoring. Advancing common indicators for leakage reduction, digitalisation, reuse and operational performance in water utilities. Industrial Energy and Water Efficiency (COMPET/ENVI) To boost competitiveness, Ireland can advance measures that accelerate uptake of proven, highefficiency technologies: Progressing Ecodesign & Energy Labelling implementing acts affecting industrial equipment such as pumps and drives. Promoting work to be undertaken to mainstream industrial water reuse as part of the industrial competitiveness agenda Encouraging Member States—via EED implementation—to prioritise industrial system-level retrofits for energy savings. • Supporting GBER enhancements to unlock state aid for industrial water and energy efficiency, particularly for SMEs. Digital Water Infrastructure (TTE/ENVI) Ireland can promote harmonised EU approaches that modernise water systems through innovation and digital tools. Key objectives: Standards for data interoperability across water networks. Support for digital twins, smart pumps, and AI-driven process optimisation. Cross-border demonstration projects that showcase efficiency and resilience gains. Financing Water and Energy Resilience (ECOFIN) Ireland can help shift EU funding toward outcome-based models that reward measurable efficiency and resilience improvements. This includes: Better alignment of Cohesion Funds, Horizon instruments and the Strategic Technologies platforms with water-resilience needs Simplifying and scaling access to EU funding for municipalities pursuing digital and efficiency upgrades.

Highefficiency pump systems, digital monitoring and leak reduction deliver 20–50% energy savings in many applications. These are fast, tangible results that strengthen household finances and Europe’s competitiveness. Strengthening Climate Adaptation and Public Protection Smart water infrastructure reduces leakage, improves stormwater management and enhances preparedness for floods and droughts. This protects homes, agriculture, and essential public services— delivering societal security as climate risks increase. Enabling Industrial Growth and Job Creation Water availability and energy efficiency are now decisive factors for investment in sectors such as pharma, semiconductors, data centres and manufacturing. By promoting resilient infrastructure and efficient processes, the Council can help Member States attract high-value investment, supporting longterm employment and regional development. Enhancing Trust in Public Infrastructure Digitalisation improves transparency, reporting and asset management in water utilities. Citizens experience fewer service disruptions, while municipalities gain tools to prioritise investments based on real-time performance. Stronger public trust is an important outcome of modern infrastructure aligned with EU objectives. In short, by focusing on resilience and efficiency, Ireland can lead Council work that delivers visible, everyday benefits while building Europe’s long-term economic foundations."

To maintain the EU’s economic competitiveness AI has become a core technology in driving productivity, innovation and creativity in high-value industries. Ireland should insure it is at the heart of this development. Cement Ireland’s position as a key digital and tech hub With 16 of the top 20 global technology companies having bases in Ireland, we have both the strategic and technological knowledge to hand to enable significant movement on AI which would send a strong message to the global digital and technology companies about Ireland as a location of choice. Position Ireland as a Global Leader in “trusted AI” Establish opportunities or the provision of a structured, real-world testing environment for AI Platforms to train models using properly licensed content while demonstrating legal compliance in a transparent and auditable way. Given the strong regulatory framework and structures which exist in Ireland and considering the industries that are based here including pharma and technology, the opportunity to position Ireland as the trusted AI leader to guide the EU through the next phase of responsible, human-centered AI development and ultimately implementation is one that should be grasped. This would also be helpful to examine how to ensure that AI does not interfere with the democratic process in terms of elections and pre-election campaigning Culture As part of the Danish Presidency of the EU, culture and media were chosen as key focus with a specific view of protection democracies from disinformation and interference. Ireland should build on the work started by Denmark in continuing to strengthen and develop cultural importance in Europe. With such a strong culture Ireland is well placed to shine a spotlight on culture during its Presidency. Specifically focusing on music as this is IMRO’s area of expertise, Ireland has a unique position in the international music scene with many Irish artists performing worldwide. Music and culture are under threat with many challenges facing performers and artists including funding, AI, infrastructure to name but a few. The Irish Presidency offers an opportunity to shine a spotlight on culture, increase public interest and engagement in cultural activities and ensure the next generation has the exposure to all aspects of our culture and the prospect of becoming more culturally involved."
153,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e4871ce8/Irish_Music_Rights_Organisation_IMRO_-_Submission_153.docx,Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO),Organisation,Copyright,National and EU,2,"The Irish Presidency of the Council in 2026 should prioritise several key policy areas and legislative proposals, drawing on Ireland’s strengths and the current challenges facing the EU: Trusted Artificial Intelligence (AI): Legislative proposals should support the introduction of AI Sandbox to allow for real-world testing environments for AI platforms to ensure AI models are trained with properly licensed content and in full compliance with legal and regulatory standards. The introduction of a Sandbox would allow for the building of trusted infrastructure for training AI on licensed and traceable content. It would ensure that rights holders across specific industries retain control, receive attribution and are compensated when their work is used in AI systems. It would also position Ireland as a market leader in the development of open-source AI systems while allowing partnerships to enable transparent and verifiable rights management as open source allows public verification of software code, without exposing privet or licensed data. Ireland should ensure the inclusion of several important principles into actionable measures including the creation of a functioning music licensing market for AI, the application of EU copyright laws to all GenAI providers operating in the EU and transparency across the AI value chain. Embedding Copyright Protection in a competitive and secure Europe Continuing the Danish Presidency’s theme of competitiveness, the Irish Presidency should emphasise that a strong copyright framework is a vital enabler of the Single Market for creative content, cultural assets and digital services. It should underscore that protecting creators’ rights is not a regulatory burden but an investment in Europe’s creative economy, cultural diversity and global competitiveness. Council Conclusions Stakeholder dialogues between Member States’ Ministries, the Commission, creative sectors especially those based in Ireland, academics and technology platforms should be arranged. The focus of these dialogues should be the importance of the three-step test, transparency obligations for AI platforms handling creative works; and a roadmap for how the creative industries will engage in forthcoming AI‐and‐copyright policy processes. With a view to achieving a position by the end of the Presidency, the ultimate aim should be the creation of a functional licensing market in which the European innovation and creative sector can grow hand in hand. Culture and Media Development CDSM Review The conclusions of the review and evaluation being carried out on the Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM) directive will be concluding as the Irish Presidency term is beginning. The results of this review will determine whether the CDSM Directive is achieving its aim of balancing creators rights with user access, whether the rules of online content are sufficient and whether fair remuneration for authors is being achieved. Ireland was one of the first countries to implement the Directive adapting our copyright laws to align with the directive. The Irish Presidency should continue to be leaders in this area and actively address recommendations from the Review. Buy-outs Online audiovisual services are increasingly using buy-outs whereby a one-off payment is given to music creators in exchange for their rights for music used in television programmes and film. With the continued growth of platforms such as Netflix, Disney and Amazon this practise will only increase with the bargaining power of creators diminishing as the power of the platforms grows. The “Principle of appropriate and proportionate remuneration” as set out in Article 18 of the CDSM Directive offers an opportunity to address this issue to the benefit of creators for the exploitation of their works. This principle should be made a mandatory rule applying to all copyright contracts, whether they are national, European or international. Such a move would eliminate a reliance on the laws of a third country to impose contractual provisions that deprive creators from claiming or using already existing mechanism to ensure fair remuneration of the use of their works. The impact of this change would be immediately felt by music creators in all corners of Europe and would be a lasting legacy of the Irish Presidency. Music Streaming Media regulation is an accepted and necessary part of our daily lives, whether devised and implemented at EU or national level it ensures fairness, impartiality and balance in the media we consume. Streaming services are the outlier as there are no regulations pertaining to their activities. With the review of the Audio-Visual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) there is an opportunity to conduct a root and branch examination of music streaming services – the algorithms, the use and presentation of AI generated works, the prominence given to EU or national artists. Regulation in this area would serve EU citizens well as it would introduce fairness and transparency to music streaming which is the number one method by which Europeans access music. Free access to cultural events throughout the country through the circulation of Culture Cards or Ireland EU Presidency Cards sent to every house in the country would not only create awareness of Ireland’s EU presidency but also focus the nation’s attention on the cultural activities in their area. It would encourage people to attend events reducing technostress through offline engagement and creating tech-free times on a regular basis over the 6 months of the Presidency. This in turn could create an offline habit which would live on long after the Presidency has moved to other countries."

Media, culture and music are central to the lives of every European regardless of age, interest, language or country. There isn’t one person who is not using or exposed to some form or culture or music on a daily basis. Roundtable discussions, dialogues and conferences involving key stakeholders, community leaders, business owners and operators to allow for a sharing of problems and exploration of solutions would present opportunities to propose better operations for the culture and music uses of EU citizens.

That said, 2 in 3 people survive their cancer diagnosis and 220,000+ people are living beyond cancer in Ireland, each one deserving to live well after cancer. Ireland’s National Cancer Strategy is due to expire in 2026, and preparations should soon be made to develop a new strategic plan. The Irish Cancer Society recommends that a key high-level thematic priority of Ireland’s Presidency would be the European Health Union, with a focus on cancer care. It is imperative that health retains the strategic focus of the European Union into the future with dedicated funding instruments (e.g. EU4Health). In particular, cancer has been a cross-cutting theme of the EU4Health programme and it is imperative that there is an opportunity for cancer and other health/healthcare matters to be prioritised by the European Union. In the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework from 2028-2034, we are concerned that positioning health alongside other competing areas runs the risk that there will be inadequate funding for vital programmes, collaborations and cross-cutting themes like cancer. Under the thematic priority of a European Health Union, Ireland can highlight its progress in enhancing cancer outcomes in recent decades, the long-term results of strategic initiatives (e.g. smoking ban) and Ireland can also speak to how we will build on progress in the coming years. Ireland can take this opportunity to showcase our commitment to cancer care and share lessons with our EU counterparts including on: the upcoming legislation on the Right to be Forgotten after Cancer (via the Central Bank Amendment Bill 2025), for people seeking access to financial products and services. the 2024 law to protect maternity leave for new mothers while they are in treatment for serious illness like cancer (Leave our Leave legislation). Furthermore, Ireland has an opportunity to further advance outcomes along the cancer care pathway and demonstrate leadership in the following areas amongst its EU peers, including (inter alia): prevention initiatives such as: o implementing a HPV vaccination catch-up programme for young people aged 24 and younger. finalising (future-proofed) legislation on the regulation of novel nicotine inhaling products. banning sunbed use expanding existing screening and introducing new screening in line with EU Council recommendations. securing fast access to medicines for people who need them progressing the digital transformation in healthcare, which would support health data and personal access to one’s own electronic health records."

As such, the Government should highlight key initiatives of the European Union such as Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, EU4Health and what this means for public policy and the residents of Ireland with regard to their health. Ireland can also highlight and provide examples of how EU funding has been used to further our health and cancer care interests. For instance, we have benefitted from €3.6 million in EU funding for investment in digital health infrastructure (relevant to the European Health Data Space). Communicating in real terms what was achieved with this funding can support residents of Ireland to understand the work that the Government will continue to do to progress our digital health infrastructure."

This is particularly pertinent given Irelands key role in the original negotiation of the SDGs and the importance of accelerated action nationally, at EU level and internationally as we enter the final years towards the 2030 target of these goals. Peacebuilding – As 2024 has been the most violent year on record since the end of the Cold War, Ireland must utilize our unique perspective and experience in the work of peace from our own peace process, and our experience in the disarmament space such as the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Ireland should share our experience and expertise in these areas with our European colleagues and lead an active policy platform on peacebuilding. International Development – ODA has seen a drop of up 17% of its funding in 2025, following a 9% drop in 2024, with large funders such as the USA and UK dramatically slashing contributions to ODA. In this time, Ireland has increased its ODA spending and has continued to focus on the positive outcomes and contributions we can make to global safety and prosperity through ODA. Ireland should take its continued commitment to ODA into its policy agenda for the EU Presidency and refocus the conversation on the overwhelming public good achieved by ODA on every level on a global scale. Multilateralism and the Protection of International Law – As a multilateral organisation, the European Union has shown the value of cooperation amongst states in achieving social, economic and political goals through cooperation across states. The upholding of international law and the rules of how we engage with one another is central to what allows states to work together effectively for common good. As multilateralism is under threat and we have seen a consistent undermining on international law, it is now vital for us to uphold and protect the validity of international law and global system."

Especially given moves under the SAFE regulation, a component of ReArm Europe, which seeks to divert funding away from social cohesion, towards the development of military infrastructure and arms manufacturing capacity. This goes against the founding statement of the Union, where in Schuman Declaration it states, ""The pooling of coal and steel production... will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims”. These moves are at odds with the founding vision of the union and can only lead to increased conflict. The European Green Deal – Ireland must prioritise the EU’s commitments under the European Green Deal and cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and net zero by 2050. These targets are becoming increasingly unlikely to be met by both Ireland individually and the Union as a whole, and this is simply not good enough. The looming climate catastrophe is the responsibility of us all, and we must continue to press forward with radical proposals which will allow us to reach these targets and create a safer, more sustainable and prosperous Europe. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due-Diligence Directive – The recent rollbacks on these vital regulatory directives have placed the European Union at a crossroads, of what exactly will be the priorities for the Union with regards to how it expects corporations to engage with both climate policies and human rights and ethical standards in business practice. Ireland must shift the narrative back to supporting these hard-won pieces of vital legislation which hold large corporations to account for their actions and their effects on the climate as well as the people and communities contributing to each part of the supply chain."

It is vital that this aspect of the EU is emphasized, with people and communities being placed at the centre of the work of the council. There is a perception that the priorities of business has overtaken the priorities of people and communities. The rollback in rights and regulations which communities and citizens have engaged with as corporate lobbying is centre stage, is bad for public confidence in and engagement with the EU. Having a strong focus on issues like sustainable development and climate which matter to citizens and communities as well as universal rights and international law will give the public a greater confidence in the direction of the Union. Proactive engagement by all Departments with the new bodies such as the new EU Scrutiny Committee on how EU directives are being transposed would send a positive message to the public on Irelands commitment to accountability and engagement within the EU.

Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. . A R e s i l i e n t an d P r e p a r e d E u r o p e The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. .

Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: •Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. •Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: •Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced.

For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives.

Ireland should prioritise a coherent set of themes centred on social justice, environmental stewardship, intergenerational responsibility, and strategic autonomy. A primary priority should be the eradication of poverty and homelessness across the Union. Ireland should work to strengthen the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights by advancing measures on adequate minimum income, fair working conditions, and stronger protections for those in precarious or low-paid employment. Particular emphasis should be placed on elevating housing as a core social right and ensuring that EU funding instruments—especially cohesion policy and the Social Climate Fund—target vulnerable communities and support a just transition to a sustainable economy. Ireland should also promote a more citizen-centred Union, ensuring that EU policymaking is transparent, accountable, and oriented towards the well-being of ordinary people rather than narrow corporate or institutional interests. Priority areas include enhancing consumer and digital rights, strengthening EU frameworks for civic participation, and improving access to high-quality public services such as healthcare, education, and public transport. The Presidency should support Member States in exploring free or low-cost public transport as an equitable climate and mobility measure. A dedicated priority should focus on long-term, intergenerational policymaking. Ireland should seek to embed an EU-wide requirement for “Future Generations Impact Assessments” for major legislative proposals and funding decisions. These assessments would examine implications for climate stability, biodiversity, resource use, social equality, and fiscal sustainability, ensuring that today’s decisions do not compromise the rights and opportunities of future Europeans. Environmental protection and restoration should form another core theme. Ireland is well placed to lead on biodiversity recovery, rewilding, and the expansion of protected areas, including both terrestrial and marine national parks. The Presidency should support the implementation of the Nature Restoration Law, promote EU-wide rewilding frameworks, and encourage nature-positive land-use transitions, with appropriate support for farmers and coastal communities. These measures should be linked to broader climate resilience, clean energy, and circular-economy objectives. Finally, Ireland should advance a vision of European strategic autonomy grounded in peace, diplomacy, and civilian resilience. Consistent with Ireland’s long-standing policy of military neutrality, the Presidency should prioritise strengthening the EU’s independent capabilities in areas such as cyber-security, humanitarian response, supply-chain security, and civilian crisis management. This approach supports a more self-reliant and stable Europe while maintaining a strong commitment to international cooperation and conflict prevention. Together, these priorities outline a balanced and forward-looking programme that aligns with Ireland’s values and supports a fair, sustainable, and citizen-focused European Union."

Key proposals include: Securing ambitious Council conclusions on the Adequate Minimum Income Directive, with binding standards that effectively raise living conditions across all Member States. Advancing legislative measures that protect workers in precarious employment, including platform workers, seasonal employees, and gig-economy labour. Supporting EU-level action to recognise housing as a fundamental social right, including frameworks to prevent homelessness, regulate speculative practices, and promote public and social housing investment. Ireland should aim to embed stronger social-impact obligations across all EU funding programmes to ensure that the benefits of the green and digital transitions accrue first to vulnerable communities. Nature Restoration, Rewilding, and Sustainable Land and Marine Management The Presidency should place particular emphasis on the implementation of the Nature Restoration Law and associated financing mechanisms. Priority actions include: Developing EU-wide rewilding frameworks, including ecological corridors, large-scale habitat restoration, and the expansion of terrestrial and marine national parks. Supporting legislative and policy measures to end grazing on Europe’s most ecologically fragile uplands, enabling large-scale rewilding, carbon recovery, and biodiversity restoration. Advancing reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy to reward nature-positive practices and support rural communities transitioning away from environmentally damaging land use. Ireland should aim to secure Council progress on long-term restoration funding within the Multiannual Financial Framework. Fair, Accessible and Sustainable Public Services and Mobility Ireland should advance proposals that support Member States in developing equitable and sustainable public services, including: EU-supported initiatives for free or low-cost public transport, supported by cohesion and climate funds. Accelerated progress on the TEN-T revision and initiatives promoting low-emission mobility. Strengthened cross-border cooperation in health and education to deliver high-quality, accessible services. Digital Rights, Consumer Protection, and Democratic Accountability Ireland should prioritise legislative work that strengthens the EU’s citizen-first digital and consumer regulatory frameworks, including: Enforcement of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. AI transparency, ethical governance, and data-protection measures that protect citizens rather than corporate interests. Enhanced consumer-protection legislation covering predatory digital practices and essential-service affordability. Strategic Autonomy, Civilian Security, and Peacebuilding Reflecting Ireland’s commitment to peace and neutrality, the Presidency should promote a model of EU security grounded in diplomacy, resilience, and independence. Priority areas include: Legislative progress on cybersecurity, civilian crisis management, supply-chain resilience, and strategic-industrial capacity.

By prioritising a socially just transition, long-term sustainability, renewed democratic accountability, and strengthened European resilience, the Presidency can ensure that the EU operates in the interests of its people and future generations. Advancing a Social Europe That Reduces Poverty and Strengthens Community Well-Being Delivering tangible social progress is essential to improving quality of life across the Union. The Presidency can make a substantial positive impact by securing progress on the Adequate Minimum Income Directive, improving protections for precarious workers, and elevating housing as a fundamental social right. These initiatives would reduce poverty, enhance income security, and strengthen the social fabric of communities. Coordinating better use of EU funding instruments—particularly cohesion policy, the Social Climate Fund, and ESF+—would ensure that vulnerable groups receive targeted support during the green and digital transitions. Delivering Environmental Restoration and Long-Term Community Resilience Communities benefit most from healthy ecosystems, resilient landscapes, and restored natural capital. Through prioritising the implementation of the Nature Restoration Law, expanding protected marine and terrestrial areas, and progressing EU-wide rewilding frameworks, the Presidency can deliver significant ecological, social, and economic gains. Ending grazing on Europe’s most fragile uplands and promoting rewilding will restore biodiversity, enhance carbon sequestration, and create new opportunities for nature-based tourism, rural regeneration, and sustainable enterprise. These actions directly support communities while preserving natural assets for future generations. Supporting Accessible Public Services and Sustainable Mobility Free or low-cost public transport, improved cross-border healthcare cooperation, and strengthened educational mobility can significantly improve the everyday lives of citizens. The Presidency can advance these goals by promoting EU-level funding and legislative frameworks that enable Member States to expand accessible public services. Sustainable mobility initiatives—especially through TEN-T reforms—will strengthen regional economies, reduce transport costs for households, and promote climate-friendly economic development. Enhancing Digital Rights, Consumer Protections, and Business Fairness Businesses, particularly SMEs, benefit from predictable regulation, fair competition, and consumer trust. By reinforcing the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, advancing AI transparency, and strengthening protections against unfair digital and commercial practices, the Presidency can support a competitive, innovative, and responsible economic environment. Strong digital rights and consumer protections also reinforce public trust in the digital economy, which is essential for long-term growth. Building a More Resilient, Peaceful, and Self-Sufficient Union A Europe that is strategically autonomous, civilian-resilient, and committed to peace brings stability to communities and security to businesses. The Presidency can deliver impact by advancing legislation on cyber resilience, protecting critical infrastructure, ensuring supply-chain security, and strengthening humanitarian and disaster-response mechanisms.

Equally, it should ensure that citizens feel directly engaged in, and represented by, the work carried out during the Presidency. Demonstrating Tangible, People-Centred Outcomes Communication is most effective when it is practical and relevant to everyday life. The Presidency should highlight EU achievements that improve living standards—such as measures reducing poverty, enhancing workers’ rights, supporting affordable housing, protecting consumers, and strengthening public services. Communicating these benefits in clear, accessible language will reinforce the idea of a Union that operates for the wellbeing of its people rather than for institutional or corporate interests. Real-world examples, case studies, and community-level data should be used to show how EU initiatives translate into better opportunities, greater security, and improved quality of life. Engaging Communities Through Inclusive and Participatory Processes Creating a sense of ownership requires citizens to see themselves as active participants rather than passive observers. Ireland should organise extensive community-level dialogues, regional forums, and targeted consultations involving young people, civil society, trade unions, small businesses, farmers, and environmental organisations. These forums should allow citizens to articulate their priorities on issues such as social rights, rewilding and biodiversity, public transport, digital fairness, and long-term sustainability. Incorporating these perspectives into public reporting on the Presidency will reinforce the idea that citizen voices directly inform Ireland’s approach at EU level. Prioritising Youth Engagement and Intergenerational Responsibility Young people are among the most directly affected by EU policy on climate, digital rights, public services, and long-term sustainability. The Presidency should promote youth assemblies, model council debates, and educational partnerships that explain how EU decisions impact future generations. Communicating Ireland’s commitment to Future Generations Impact Assessments will further demonstrate the EU’s long-term responsibility, helping young people see the Union as an instrument for safeguarding their future. Clear, Consistent, and Transparent Messaging The Presidency should adopt a unified communication strategy centred on the values of fairness, sustainability, democracy, and peace. Communication should emphasise Ireland’s leadership in areas such as nature restoration, rewilding, social rights, and strategic autonomy. Transparency—including regular public briefings, accessible summaries of Council outcomes, and clear explanations of legislative progress—will strengthen trust and counter misinformation. Cultural, Creative, and Community-Based Communication Ireland should leverage its strong cultural sector to communicate EU values in an engaging and inclusive manner. Artistic projects, local exhibitions, digital storytelling, and national events celebrating Ireland’s Presidency can help broaden engagement beyond traditional political audiences. These initiatives should emphasise shared European identity, cultural diversity, and the collective commitment to protecting people, communities, and the natural world."

Holding the EU Presidency offers Ireland a platform to confront these challenges with ambition, leadership, and concrete action. By leveraging the Presidency to advance ambitious EU-wide initiatives in social protection, housing, healthcare, sustainability, and ecological restoration, Ireland can demonstrate a practical commitment to tackling these longstanding domestic issues while setting a bold example for other Member States. The Presidency should embed intergenerational responsibility and long-term sustainability into all Council deliberations, ensuring that decisions contribute to a fairer, greener, and more resilient Europe. Initiatives such as ending grazing on Europe’s most fragile uplands, expanding terrestrial and marine national parks, and prioritising social and climate-focused investment would allow Ireland to translate domestic imperatives into European leadership. By pairing radical ambition with citizen-centred communication, Ireland can strengthen public trust in the EU, foster engagement and ownership among citizens, and show that the Union can deliver tangible improvements in people’s lives. In doing so, the Irish Presidency can leave a lasting positive legacy, demonstrating that Europe’s environmental, social, and economic challenges can be addressed with courage, vision, and practical action."

From the standpoint of Sazerac, these priorities matter profoundly because regulatory coherence, market stability, and investment confidence underpin our long term ability to supply consumers, support employment, and maintain strong relationships with agricultural and rural partners. The Commission Work Programme for 2026 foregrounds competitiveness and innovation, and Ireland is well positioned to build on these priorities through its Presidency. The proposed European Innovation Act, which aims to strengthen European industrial renewal and support research-led growth, is a clear example of the type of enabling environment that multinational producers rely upon. Ireland should also focus on ensuring that the Single Market remains functional, predictable, and free from unnecessary barriers. The Twenty Eighth Regime for Innovative Companies, which seeks to simplify cross border business conditions, reflects the kind of structural reform that can reinforce Europe’s appeal for global investment. These benefit sectors such as spirits production that must navigate complex regulatory requirements across Member States. Policies that reduce fragmentation and encourage proportional and science-led regulation help preserve consumer choice, avoid duplication of compliance burdens and support the continued availability of a diverse range of products across the European Union. Sustainability and supply chain resilience should form another key theme. The Work Programme recognises the strategic importance of Europe’s agri food sector. The introduction of policy to strengthen competitiveness and resilience in farming is particularly relevant given our reliance on grain producers, maltsters and rural services. A Presidency that emphasises balanced agricultural policy can help ensure that environmental objectives are aligned with economic sustainability for primary producers and processors. A further priority should be workforce development. The Quality Jobs Act, which aims to support modern employment conditions, and the Fair Labour Mobility Package, which proposes new tools such as a European Social Security Pass, are important for maintaining an adaptable and skilled workforce. Global firms depend on clear and consistent labour frameworks to invest confidently in people and future capacity. Finally, Ireland can use its Presidency to highlight the value of partnership between government and industry. The Work Programme’s emphasis on better regulation and simplification, particularly through its forthcoming Communication on Better Regulation, provides an opportunity to showcase the benefits of reducing administrative burdens for businesses while maintaining high standards of consumer and environmental protection. Together these themes form a coherent and pragmatic Presidency agenda that supports competitiveness, sustainability, and long term prosperity for European communities."

Ireland’s perspective as a nation with economic strengths presents a unique opportunity to advance policies that balance regulatory objectives with economic sustainability for Sazerac. One priority area is the improvement of regulatory proportionality and simplification. The forthcoming Communication on Better Regulation, which aims to streamline legislative processes and reduce unnecessary burdens, is essential for sectors such as spirits manufacturing. A clarified and predictable regulatory environment enables companies to plan investment cycles with confidence, retain product diversity and maintain relationships with suppliers. In addition, the planned omnibus initiative on simplifying food and feed safety legislation provides a practical opportunity to remove duplicative requirements and promote a more harmonised approach to compliance across the Union. Ireland should also prioritise competitiveness through modernisation of the Single Market framework. The European Product Act reforms, which aim to update rules on product compliance, standardisation, and market surveillance, are particularly relevant for companies distributing across the Single Market. Ensuring that these reforms do not create new complexities or fragmentation will be important for preserving consumer choice and avoiding supply disruptions. Ireland can use the Presidency to advocate for proportionate implementation and for impact assessments that reflect the realities of cross border manufacturing and distribution. Agricultural and rural resilience should also receive focused attention. The proposed update of unfair trading practices rules in the food chain reflects the European Union's recognition that farmers must be supported through improved market transparency and fairer trading conditions. These initiatives complement Ireland’s interest in sustaining rural economies and align with Sazerac’s reliance on stable agricultural inputs. A Presidency that advances these files can help ensure that regulatory changes take account of the interconnected nature of the agri food supply chain. Skills development and labour mobility represent another crucial policy domain. The Fair Labour Mobility Package, including its proposals for a European Social Security Pass and measures to strengthen the European Labour Authority, will support the movement of talent across borders and improve the functioning of labour markets. This is particularly relevant for global companies that depend on specialised skills and predictable workforce planning. Together these policy priorities can help Ireland deliver a Presidency that supports a competitive Single Market, improves regulatory certainty, strengthens rural communities and ensures that European businesses remain resilient in a changing global environment."
312,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/828eb500/Sazerac_Ireland_-_Submission_312.docx,Sazerac Ireland,Business,Spirits,National and EU-wide.,3,"Ireland’s Presidency can achieve substantial positive outcomes for people, businesses and communities by prioritising practical reforms that support competitiveness, ensure regulatory predictability, and reinforce the resilience of European supply chains. The Commission Work Programme identifies several initiatives that align directly with these goals and offer Ireland a strong basis for shaping discussions within the Council. A key area where the Presidency can make a meaningful difference is in simplifying regulatory requirements. The Communication on Better Regulation aims to improve legislative coherence, reduce administrative burdens and promote clearer implementation across Member States. We would like to see single-market coherence on stances related to labelling for the alcohol industry, rather than having to abide by individual, complex and ambiguous rules and varying member states. When applied effectively, such simplification makes it easier for companies to invest, scale production and maintain employment. For communities whose livelihoods depend on manufacturing, agriculture or logistics, the benefits of reduced administrative complexity are significant. The planned simplification of food and feed safety legislation provides another concrete opportunity to remove duplication and align national practices. The Presidency can also support rural communities by advancing agricultural policies that strengthen competitiveness and fairness within the supply chain. The planned update to unfair trading practices rules seeks to increase transparency, promote cooperation among enforcement authorities and ensure that farmers are not compelled to sell below production cost. These measures are essential for maintaining the viability of primary producers who supply industries such as spirits manufacturing. A Presidency that progresses initiatives like these will deliver benefits that extend far beyond the agricultural sector into the wider rural economy. Consumer welfare can also be strengthened through a focus on regulatory coherence within the Single Market. The European Product Act reforms, which aim to update rules governing product compliance and standardisation, have the potential to improve product safety and clarity while maintaining choice. Ireland can promote balanced implementation that avoids unnecessary costs for producers while ensuring that consumers benefit from consistent product information and reliable availability. Workforce development is another area where the Presidency can have a positive impact. The Fair Labour Mobility Package introduces proposals that aim to improve the portability of social security rights and strengthen labour market governance. These reforms support workers in accessing opportunities across the Union and help businesses attract talent more efficiently. When combined with the Quality Jobs Act, which aims to modernise working conditions, these initiatives can contribute to more resilient and dynamic labour markets. Together these measures support communities by sustaining jobs, strengthening rural economies, increasing consumer choice and improving the conditions for enterprise growth. Ireland can therefore deliver a Presidency that creates practical and lasting benefits for citizens across Europe."
312,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/828eb500/Sazerac_Ireland_-_Submission_312.docx,Sazerac Ireland,Business,Spirits,National and EU-wide.,4,"Ireland can communicate the values and benefits of European Union membership effectively by grounding its Presidency narrative in the themes that impact citizens in everyday life, particularly those linked to competitiveness, consumer protection, rural resilience, and employment. There are several examples of upcoming policies which Ireland can draw upon to illustrate how the European Union delivers practical change for households and businesses. A clear narrative on the importance of simpler and more predictable regulation will resonate strongly with both consumers and enterprises. The Communication on Better Regulation, which aims to make laws clearer and reduce administrative burdens, Ireland can demonstrate how the European Union seeks to remove unnecessary complexity from people’s lives. When rules are easier to understand and apply, businesses can operate more effectively, workers can spend less time navigating bureaucracy and consumers experience more consistent access to goods and services. Agricultural and rural policy provides another compelling storytelling opportunity. Citizens in rural communities are acutely aware of the pressures facing farmers and agri-food producers. By highlighting initiatives such as the update to unfair trading practices rules, Ireland can show how the European Union is working to strengthen fairness in the food supply chain and support rural economic resilience. These policies provide tangible benefits for rural communities linked to Sazerac’s own supply chain, including grain producers and transport providers. Consumer facing initiatives also offer accessible examples to communicate the role and value of the Single Market. The European Product Act reforms, which aim to modernise compliance rules and improve standards, can help demonstrate how the European Union works to protect consumers while supporting the availability of diverse and affordable products. Ireland can position itself as a leader in promoting balanced implementation that benefits both producers and consumers. Workforce policy is an area that speaks directly to the interests of families and young people. The Fair Labour Mobility Package, which aims to improve the portability of social security rights and strengthen cooperation between Member States, provides a concrete example of how European Union action helps workers access employment opportunities more easily. These measures support a more dynamic and inclusive labour market and help citizens understand how European policies affect their personal and professional lives. By combining practical policy examples, inclusive public engagement and clear messaging, Ireland can help citizens recognise the value of the European Union in their daily lives and foster a sense of shared ownership over the Presidency and its achievements."

Several initiatives proposed for 2026 provide important opportunities to support competitiveness, supply chain stability and rural livelihoods, all of which are directly relevant to Sazerac’s operations and the communities we serve. Sazerac values the constructive engagement it has experienced with Irish authorities and believes that Ireland’s Presidency offers an opportunity to highlight how international companies contribute to economic growth, employment and rural development. As the Presidency agenda advances, Sazerac remains ready to provide further insights into the economic and social contributions of the spirits sector, as well as the potential impacts of regulatory decisions on investment and supply chain resilience. We believe that a Presidency focused on competitiveness, rural sustainability, workforce mobility and better regulation will support a strong and vibrant European economy that is capable of responding to emerging global challenges while protecting the interests of citizens and communities."

Irish has previously acted as a leader in this area through the work of former minister for external affairs Frank Aiken, who was one of the leading figures in the nuclear disarmament movement. Active Irish neutrality as exemplified in the legacy of Aiken is cherished by the Irish people and positions us uniquely as a leader in peacebuilding in a European context that is increasingly hawkish. Our history as a former colony affords us a unique perspective on the horrors of imperialism, a complete rejection of imperialism (corporate and state) should be central to our presidency. As such, Ireland must make meaningful sanctions against Israel central to the objectives of this presidency. Israel has been permitted and supported to commit a genocide against the people of Palestine. Europe must immediately cease any cultural, educational or economic collaboration with Israel. Europe must call for an invocation of UN powers under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter to facilitate the safe delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Europe must support an end to the illegal occupation of Palestine, the removal of all illegal settlements, a full recognition of the equal rights of Palestinians including a right to self-determination, the provision of reparations for the untold suffering endured by people of Palestine at the hands of Israel and its allies, a right of return for all Palestinians and a demand that Israel be held accountable for its crimes."

Serious food allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. 1. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community-level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. 2. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, treatments, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

Key priorities include: 1. Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, to ensure treatment for all patients at risk Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. 2. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (non-legislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness.

Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised food allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. 2. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings.

Ireland will assume the Presidency at a particularly critical time for the EU as MEPs in Parliament and Member States in Council work to finalise the next Multiannual Financial Framework and implement a range of policy actions, all in the context of an increasingly volatile global environment and rapidly evolving international relationships. We are now almost 18 months into the 2024-2029 European Parliament term and approaching the oneyear anniversary of the current European Commission taking office, and throughout this time there has been a single, overarching priority that has set the tone for all policy actions taken at European level: competitiveness. When Ireland assumes the Presidency, we will pass the two-year anniversary of the Mario Draghi report on the Future of European Competitiveness. The Fine Gael delegation believes that this should be the main high-level priority for the Presidency in 2026. At a high level, Ireland’s Presidency should aim to progress the types of initiatives that would result in the delivery of the objectives set out in Mr. Draghi’s report, for example lowering energy costs, simplification and removal of red-tape and overregulation, removing barriers to the roll-out of critical infrastructure, and better enabling access to capital for European SMEs and start-ups. this is only partly true, and often the challenge is about the need for clearer rules that are easier to navigate. Nevertheless, it is a fact that in recent years over 100 separate pieces of digital legislation have been proposed at EU level. Companies must spend a huge amount of time on their compliance with EU regulatory obligations. The companies that people largely choose to share their data with remain the large US multinationals, while European competition struggles to grow. Despite past efforts, the EU remains too slow where speed is needed and too fragmented where unity is vital. Child safety online The Irish Presidency should put the safety of children and young people at the centre of the EU’s digital agenda. Across Europe, parents are increasingly worried about the risks young people face as they grow up in a rapidly evolving online environment marked by harmful content, manipulative design, and unsafe interactions. The Presidency should drive coordinated Council engagement on wider online-safety debates, such as the harmonisation of age-verification systems, the promotion of digital literacy, and programmes to empower parents and guardians in supporting young people’s online lives. Irish leadership in this regard will bring real, tangible benefits to citizens across the country, and across Europe. Tackling online fraud Over 3 in 4 Irish people have encountered some form of suspicious activities online, while 45% of people state that they have experienced more suspicious activity compared to this time last year. Such incidents are hard to track and almost impossible to reverse after they happen. The Digital Services Act (DSA) obliges platforms to take down illegal content once it has been reported; however, it creates few proactive obligations prior to publication or even reporting by individuals. It is all too easy to post fake advertisements, purporting to be from regulated institutions, and for unsuspecting citizens to be scammed out of their own money before the advert disappears again. Some platforms are currently making 10% of their advertising revenue from such fake advertisements, thereby profiting from people’s misery. Delivering more homes, faster and at lower cost Across the EU, housing supply is held back by complex processes, fragmented standards, and limited access to affordable finance for both public and private developers. Ireland can use its Presidency to advance measures that streamline approvals, encourage common standards for modern construction methods, and promote the wider use of digital planning tools that reduce delays while maintaining high safety and quality. By focusing on practical steps that remove unnecessary bottlenecks ad bring down building costs, the EU can help ensure that more homes are built where they are needed and built at a pace that meets the scale of Europe’s housing challenge. Delivering for Farmers Ireland has a great opportunity during its Presidency to help deliver a fair income for farmers in the face of rising input costs, market volatility, and environmental obligations. This is critical for the viability of our farming sector and for our rural towns and villages. Ireland can use its Presidency to facilitate progress on practical tools to improve farmers’ bargaining power, reduce administrative burdens, and ensure a level playing field across the Single Market. These would all have significant positive impact on a sector that has been continuously under pressure in recent years. Generational renewal remains one of the most acute challenges within the agriculture sector. By delivering a positive outcome on CAP, the Irish Presidency can help deliver advance targeted schemes and EU-level incentives that make farming a viable and attractive career path for young men and women, including support for training, access to finance, and rural development programmes as contained within the Commission’s Generational Renewal Strategy. More broadly, the Presidency should ensure that rural development remains at the heart of EU policymaking in 2026 - protecting the funding streams that communities rely on, championing programmes like LEADER, and ensuring that policy choices made in Brussels translate into real benefits for families, businesses, and communities across rural Europe."

A nationwide programme of events, directly linking EU actions to tangible outcomes for households, communities and businesses would help make the Presidency visible and more relevant for citizens. Additionally, specific engagement across schools and universities would help to build students’ interest and understanding of how the EU works, the role of the Council and Parliament, and how EU policies benefit them. Schools and universities could also be involved through national competitions and debates on Ireland's role in the EU, helping younger generations build a sense of connection and ownership over the Presidency. Highlighting the benefits of EU programmes such as Erasmus+, PEACEPLUS and LEADER through local events would help reinforce how EU membership delivers for rural Ireland, job creation and regional development. Housing is a top priority for the Government, for citizens and for the European Commission, and should feature prominently in citizen-focused engagement. A high-profile Housing Summit during the Presidency would demonstrate how EU cooperation can help lower construction costs, accelerate delivery, share best practices and support the new Affordable Housing Plan for Europe. This should align clearly with Ireland’s broader Presidency agenda and help link policy priorities to real outcomes. The Presidency should also include initiatives that help businesses and communities to make the most of EU opportunities. A targeted campaign to support cross-border trade, especially for SMEs and start-ups, would sit naturally alongside an emphasis on competitiveness, reducing red tape, and improving access to finance. The EU Week of Sport in September 2026 is an important opportunity to highlight the EU’s support for grassroots sport and celebrating Irish traditional sports, such as the GAA, being played across Europe. The Irish Presidency should combine the official launch of sport week in Dublin with support for local sports clubs, school, and community groups to host local events around the country. Likewise, the EU Gender Equality Week in November 2026 provides a valuable opportunity to showcase Ireland’s leadership on Women, Peace and Security and to highlight national and EU-level efforts to combat gender-based violence and strengthen women’s economic security."

Its upcoming Presidency of the Council of the EU presents a timely opportunity to champion accelerating the adoption of technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), to strengthen Irish and EU competitiveness as well as the productivity of enterprises and the public sector across the region. Identifying ways in which the EU can support and boost the adoption of digital and AI technologies across Europe should be a central pillar of the Irish Presidency. This priority is already embedded in both EU and Irish national policy, yet 2025 data shows the EU remains far from reaching its 2030 Digital Decade targets for technology uptake. Recent initiatives such as the EU Apply AI Strategy, which introduces an “AI-first” approach across organisations and public administrations, are important steps. The Irish Presidency can play a pivotal role in sustaining this momentum. Salesforce provided recommendations for boosting AI adoption in Europe in its response to the EU Public Consultation on this initiative. Benefits of Prioritising AI Policy Salesforce supports the EU’s goal to lead in responsible and trusted AI innovation and accelerate AI adoption. Across key industries, from manufacturing to pharmaceuticals, latest innovations such as AI agents are enabling optimisation of production and productivity gains, making European enterprises more innovative and competitive. The societal benefits are equally significant. AI is enhancing customer service, making public services more responsive and strengthening cybersecurity. Ireland’s national commitment to delivering more efficient and user-friendly digital public services already positions AI as a key driver of more accessible and citizen-centric services. AI is also leveling the playing field for SMEs, the backbone of the Irish and European economy. Our latest global research showed that a key strategy for SMEs to level the playing field against larger competitors and drive their growth is ramping up their tech investments. 75% of SMEs are already investing in AI and experiencing tangible returns, including increased productivity, improved customer experiences, and revenue growth. Yet many SMEs remain overwhelmed by the pace of technological change and face barriers such as data quality, skills gaps, and security concerns. The Irish Presidency can create a strong EU-focus on enabling secure, trustworthy AI adoption to ensure SMEs can fully benefit. It can approach this in a number of ways for example: set up an SME Taskforce to identify barriers and potential measures to encourage the safe and responsible adoption across the sector. It could also run a short, targeted campaign that outlines the benefits for SMEs, which then builds confidence across the sector. Given Ireland is a major European technology hub, it is uniquely positioned to lead this agenda. It should continue to champion the EU’s work toward global alignment with partners, including the establishment of globally interoperable AI governance frameworks, by actively supporting EU engagement in the G7, the OECD, and other international fora. For these reasons, we recommend that Accelerating AI and digital technology adoption to strengthen EU competitiveness, productivity, and public-sector effectiveness be selected as a core thematic priority for Ireland’s 2026 Presidency of the Council."

Ireland’s position as a leading European technology hub gives it a unique role in steering Council discussions toward practical measures that enhance adoption, foster innovation, and ensure the benefits of AI are accessible across sectors and Member States. Advancing the EU’s agenda on simplifying digital rules The EU’s ambition to be a global digital leader is hindered by an increasingly fragmented and overlapping regulatory landscape. Ireland’s recent policy paper ‘Ireland’s Priorities for Digital Simplification’ sets out proposals to reduce regulatory complexity, improve coherence across digital legislation and support innovation and competitiveness in the Single Market. These policies can be advanced by Ireland, through its presidency. Despite strong research and innovation capacity, Europe has faced challenges translating these strengths into global competitiveness, particularly in advanced technologies such as AI. To unlock the full potential of the Digital Single Market, the EU must move toward a simpler, more coherent, and more predictable digital regulatory framework. In this context, Salesforce welcomes the European Union’s focus on simplification and its commitment to building a more coherent and consistent legislative framework for digital policy, including through the recently presented Digital Omnibus proposals. These initiatives offer a concrete opportunity to streamline rules, reduce legal uncertainty, and facilitate responsible technology deployment across the EU. We encourage the Irish Presidency to prioritise progress on these files within the Council to support timely adoption and ensure businesses can benefit from a clearer and more enabling regulatory environment. Salesforce provided concrete suggestions and recommendations ahead of the presentation of the Digital Omnibus and remains committed to continuing engaging with policymakers throughout the legislative process. We also encourage Ireland to support and actively contribute to the Digital Fitness Check the European Commission is expected to conduct in 2026. This will be an essential mechanism to evaluate the cumulative impact of digital legislation, assess interoperability between regulatory instruments, and ensure Europe’s digital rules effectively contribute to competitiveness and innovation. 3. Strengthening international collaboration In line with the EU’s 2025 International Digital Strategy, Salesforce supports the EU’s commitment to working closely with global partners to strengthen Europe’s competitiveness. We believe the Irish Presidency has a key role to play in fostering relationships with third countries. In this context, we welcome the remarks made by the Minister of State for Trade Promotion, AI and Digital Transformation, Niamh Smyth, during the signing ceremony of the Declaration for European Digital Sovereignty, where she reiterated the importance of pursuing digital sovereignty in an open and collaborative manner. We urge the Presidency to continue advancing this approach, which, as Minister Smyth noted, “makes the EU stronger in the long run.”"

The Irish Presidency has an opportunity to deliver substantial, tangible benefits for people, businesses and communities across the EU by placing a strong focus on digital transformation and regulatory simplification—two areas that directly affect citizens’ daily lives and the competitiveness of European enterprises. Supporting the digitalisation of organisations, including the public sector Building on the themes outlined in our previous answers, advancing the digital transformation of Europe’s economy and public administrations would have immediate and widespread impact across the 27 Member States. Encouraging the adoption of trustworthy and innovative technologies, particularly AI, can increase productivity for businesses of all sizes, support job creation, and help workers focus on higher-value, more meaningful tasks. In the public sector, accelerating the deployment of modern digital tools can significantly improve the quality, speed, and accessibility of public services. One such example of these opportunities is healthcare, as seen here in Ireland with the ongoing rollout of a national electronic health record (EHR) aimed to deliver faster diagnostics, better-coordinated care, and more seamless patient experiences. Technologies such as agentic AI can help public administrations reduce backlogs, simplify administrative processes, and respond more effectively to the needs of citizens. For communities, this translates into quicker access to essential services, more personalised interactions with public bodies, and a more efficient use of public resources. Advancing the EU agenda on simplifying digital rules A clearer, more coherent digital regulatory framework would directly benefit EU citizens and organisations by reducing administrative burdens, improving legal certainty, and enabling faster innovation. Simplification supports SMEs in particular - helping them adopt new technologies more easily and compete more effectively - while also empowering consumers by ensuring that rules governing digital services are understandable, consistent, and future-proof. By prioritising progress on initiatives such as the Digital Omnibus proposals and actively contributing to the 2026 Digital Fitness Check, the Irish Presidency can help create a regulatory environment that better supports economic growth, innovation, and consumer trust."

Divergent and opaque national rules on TPLF - further fragmented through the implementation of the Representative Actions Directive - create legal uncertainty and distort competition, undermine effective enforcement and trigger forum shopping. Ireland can steer Council discussions toward a Minimum Harmonisation Directive and Recommendation focused on transparency, independence of litigation conduct, conflict-of-interest safeguards and proportionate financial soundness rules. It should also promote evidence-generation tools—including annual reporting and an EU-level register—and explore proportionate oversight options leveraging existing EU networks. By anchoring TPLF in fairness, transparency and consumer protection, the Irish Presidency can enhance the effective delivery of justice and strengthen the EU’s economic competitiveness. Third-party litigation funders currently operate in the EU in a regulatory vacuum and without any transparency requirements. This lack of oversight is in stark contrast with other related sectors, such as legal and financial services that are highly regulated. Due to its clear position that prohibits TPLF under its own laws, Ireland is uniquely placed to explain the benefits for consumers and for businesses of regulating TPLF and of preventing the spread of privatized enforcement through profit-driven mass litigation and to put forward the regulation of TPLF at EU level."

The overarching objective must be to promote civil justice systems that are fair, balanced, and effective—ensuring that consumers with legitimate grievances are compensated, while also recognizing that access to justice can depend on financial resources. The EU Directive on Representative Actions (RAD) introduces the role of funders in disputes, however still provides incomplete regulation on litigation funding from our perspective, that means not across all mass claim measures and without adequate safeguards. The ECIPE Paper – ‘The Impact of Increased Mass Litigation in Europe’ 03/2025 well summarizes that while minimum standards have been implemented into the RAD, it allowed nonharmonized rules to persist. The different implementations of the RAD indeed led to an increased patchwork across the Members States, beside other mass claim measures still exist in parallel. The potential for forum shopping therefore expands, as some EU countries adopt a more permissive approach to mass litigation. Our experience from other jurisdictions demonstrates that without adequate safeguards, incl. supervision, private funders’ commercial interests may diverge from, or even conflict with, those of claimants. This misalignment can compromise fairness, inflate costs, and incentivize unmeritorious claims. This misalignment can compromise fairness, inflate costs, and incentivise unmeritorious claims. The introduction of a purely profit-motivated third party, often non-EU based, into the traditional lawyer-client relationship, raises serious ethical concerns and presents an economic security threat for Europe. Given that litigation funding is rapidly becoming part of mainstream litigation culture in Europe, harmonising TPLF frameworks at the EU level has become increasingly necessary. Doing so would help prevent abusive practices, protect consumers and enterprises from undue risks, and ensure that TPLF serves its intended purpose: facilitating legitimate access to justice rather than promoting profitdriven and unethical litigation strategies."

Progress on delivery is essential not only for climate objectives, but for energy security, economic competitiveness, and the resilience of Europe’s industrial base. Fostering sustainable innovation will be key to delivering on this priority, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy sources, electrification of transport and heating, and the adoption of smart technologies that optimise energy use and reduce waste. By promoting digital solutions such as smart grids, IoT-enabled infrastructure, and data-driven energy management, the EU can deliver cleaner, more affordable energy while enhancing resilience. Building a resilient, secure competitive future The EU’s economy depends increasingly on the resilience of its foundational infrastructure, notably energy systems, housing, water services, transport and digital networks and AI. These underpin industrial competitiveness, social wellbeing and economic security. Ireland’s EU Presidency should advance a European agenda that strengthens infrastructure and renewal to support secure, affordable and sustainable growth. It should emphasise modern, interconnected and resilient energy infrastructure, including electricity grids and storage, as a foundation for clean industrial growth, system stability and consumer protection. Improving energy efficiency and resource productivity across buildings and public infrastructure will also be central to strengthening Europe’s long-term competitiveness and economic security. By prioritising affordability and sustainability, these measures will reduce costs for households and enterprises while safeguarding supply security.

Ireland’s EU Presidency presents a vital moment to deliver on the aims of the EU Commission’s work programme, which commits to ensuring a genuine Energy Union by upgrading grids, removing bottlenecks, cutting red tape for cross-border energy projects, and boosting electrification and the resilience of the electricity system. The forthcoming reviews of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) represent a pivotal opportunity to accelerate delivery. The Irish Presidency will play a central role in launching and shaping these negotiations and setting the direction for the next phase of EU electrification. Key policy priorities should include Ensuring a level-playing field for electricity: reform energy taxation, deploy tripartite contracts for electrification and energy efficiency, expand PPAs, CfDs, and state guarantees to secure affordable, clean electricity. Support electrification in key sectors: Buildings: Ensure, under existing frameworks, heat pump deployment and digital building management. Retrofit programmes should integrate smart controls and demand-response capabilities - directly supporting the goals of EU’s Affordable Housing Action Plan Transport: Driving effective implementation of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure and electricity market legislation Industry: Promote and incentivise direct electrification of heat and motion Taken together, these measures could deliver on the Affordable Energy Action Plan and the EU’s Green Deal objectives, ensuring competitiveness while reducing fossil fuel dependency by up to one-third by 2030 and structurally lowering energy prices through efficiency, flexibility, and digital control. Grid modernisation and infrastructure planning The European Grids Package is pivotal to unlocking electrification at scale. Ireland should prioritise accelerated permitting for transmission and distribution upgrades, anticipatory investments, and regional coordination through ENTSO-E. Beyond physical expansion, non-wire alternative could be prioritised. As negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the European Competitiveness Fund (ECF) are expected to reach a decisive phase during the Irish Presidency, Ireland is well positioned to ensure that funding for smart grids, digital water systems, and building automation is earmarked.

The European Commission estimates that without past efficiency gains, EU energy use in 2022 would have been 27% higher, equivalent to the combined annual energy consumption of France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Finland. Improving efficiency cuts fossil fuel imports by €33 billion annually by 2030 and delivers up to 40% of required CO₂ reductions. The Council Presidency is a key opportunity to prioritise accelerating implementation of the Affordable Energy Action Plan and the Clean Industrial Deal through: Fast-tracking grid and flexibility legislation under the European Grids Package to enable dynamic load management and reduce peak demand, lowering costs for households and SMEs. Making electricity competitive by guiding the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) Driving reforms to electricity market design to decouple retail prices from volatile gas costs and promote long-term contracts for renewables, ensuring predictable and affordable energy. Ensuring adequate incentives are available for industries and SMEs, including dynamic pricing and flexible connection agreements. Strengthening energy security by coordinating gas storage rules and diversification measures, building on Council agreements to safeguard winter supply and phase out Russian imports. These steps will help shield citizens from energy poverty (affecting over 46 million Europeans) and restore competitiveness by reducing industrial electricity costs, which remain 2-3 times higher than in the US and China. Creating jobs and industrial renewal The twin transition is an engine of job creation. The Clean Industrial Deal mobilises over €100 billion to support EU-made clean manufacturing and electrification, with sustainability criteria in public procurement to boost demand for European technologies. Priority actions include: Scaling heat pump, rooftop PV, and building management system deployment, which studies show could generate up to 1 million installation and maintenance jobs across the EU - roles that cannot be offshored. Embedding sustainability in procurement frameworks, as recommended by Mario Draghi’s competitiveness report, to stimulate local supply chains and SMEs. Supporting workforce reskilling for green and digital transitions, leveraging Council conclusions on industrial policy and tax incentives for clean technologies. This approach aligns with the EU’s industrial strategy to strengthen resilience, reduce dependencies, and create high-quality jobs in sectors critical for the green transition. Boosting competitiveness European industries face structural disadvantages due to high energy costs and global competition. The Irish Presidency can help embed competitiveness into EU legislation by: Advancing the Electrification Act and Clean Industrial Deal measures Promoting digitalisation and AI-driven optimisation in industrial processes Driving investment frameworks under InvestEU and the proposed Industrial Decarbonisation Bank to de-risk clean energy projects and accelerate innovation.

Ireland’s Presidency should use its overarching slogan and priority themes to translate EU policies into tangible benefits for everyday life: lower energy bills, cleaner air, and digital opportunities for all. Rather than abstract references to treaties or governance, communication should focus on how EU initiatives - such as the Electrification Action Plan and European Grids Package - enable practical improvements: affordable energy, modern infrastructure, and green jobs. Storytelling should highlight real examples, like families saving on heating costs through retrofits or communities benefiting from local renewable projects. This approach frames EU membership as a driver of prosperity and sustainability, reinforcing trust and relevance. Engage through local platforms Ownership grows when citizens see themselves in the process. Regional forums, town halls, and pop-up “EU in Your Community” events can showcase success stories such as community solar schemes, smart homes, and EV charging hubs. These events should be interactive, e.g., using live demonstrations of energy-saving technologies and digital tools, to make the EU’s climate and digital ambitions tangible. Collaboration with Member States, local authorities and civil society will ensure inclusivity, reaching rural areas and underrepresented groups. Digital town halls can complement physical events, enabling broad participation and dialogue. Partnerships with education and industry Schools and universities are critical multipliers for EU values. Educational programmes can link Presidency themes to curricula, offering workshops on sustainability, energy, AI, and digital careers. Competitions for students, such as designing “smart cities of the future”, can spark creativity and ownership. Similarly, partnerships with SMEs and industry associations can showcase pathways to green jobs and digital innovation, reinforcing the message that EU membership drives competitiveness and opportunity. These collaborations should be highlighted through case studies and media campaigns, demonstrating how EU policies translate into local economic growth. Inclusive and transparent communication Transparency is key. Regular progress reports, accessible summaries of Council decisions, and clear timelines for Presidency initiatives should be published in plain language.

Throughout its Presidency’s term, Ireland will guide the work of the Member States in strengthening the EU’s capacity to act in this increasingly complex environment. While a wide range of priorities could be pursued, we highlight the following three high-level thematic areas for Ireland’s Council Presidency term, as they have enduring relevance and could benefit from focused dialogue and consideration among Member States. Shaping Europe Through the Essential Role of Youth Europe is a rapidly aging continent. Beyond the demographic implications of this challenge, having youth as meaningful protagonists of their social environments will require their participation in processes and spaces through which consequential decisions are made, particularly those that shape policy. The Irish Presidency should place youth policies at the heart of its agenda. Fostering a culture in which youth feel their voices are heard and opinions valued will need to go beyond establishing formal mechanisms for youth participation. It will require cultivating a structure that embraces openness and humility toward the creative and sometimes challenging insights young people bring to policy discussions. If youth are given such creative space, they will not only contribute to existing policy processes, but can bring fresh ideas to help rethink and reshape current social structures. In this respect, young people should not be regarded merely as inheritors of existing social systems. Overcoming Racism and Advancing Social Cohesion Considering Ireland’s longstanding role in advancing equality and social cohesion, the Council could prioritize anti-racism and social cohesion during its presidency. Without recognizing that humanity is indivisible, arbitrary divisions—of “us” versus “them”—will continue to fragment European society. Efforts to eradicate racism must be transformative, fostering an understanding that there is only an “us.” A European Union that truly values “unity in diversity” is not about mere coexistence or asking certain groups to fit an existing framework. Instead, it fosters joint conversations among populations from different backgrounds, harnessing their contributions to co-create something new. The presidency should host dialogues that foster this understanding and initiate legislative action that is binding and consequential for all member states. Promoting Just, Sustainable, and Secure Food Systems Considering Ireland’s strong connection to agriculture, we believe it is imperative to uphold a just, sustainable and resilient food system that supports the needs and well-being of all. In this context, the Presidency should ensure that any legislation relating to agricultural trade enables trade to be conducted fairly and to the benefit of all, without causing any country or region, within or beyond the EU, to become overly dependent on another, or exploited for the advantage of the other. Furthermore, the Presidency’s priorities should allow for every country—not only those privileged in the existing economic order—to work towards food sovereignty, strengthen resilience to ecological, economic, and other pressures, and maintain the ability to make independent decisions."

In line with the forthcoming EU Youth Strategy, the Irish Presidency could help advance conversations on a bold, comprehensive, and binding framework for youth engagement across all member states. This could include a white paper on youth, outlining measures to implement coordinated approaches across member states, regions, and cities, ensuring that young people at the local level are actively involved in addressing societal challenges and contributing to policy development. Furthermore, realizing the potential of young people as agents of change requires access to empowering educational experiences. Within the context of the European Education Area, the Irish Presidency could promote a vision of education that extends beyond preparing youth for the labor market. Education should be recognized as a tool to inspire young people to develop their talents and capabilities for personal growth and societal progress, fostering critical thinking, social awareness, and moral and civic responsibility. Overcoming Racism and Advancing Social Cohesion The Irish Presidency could, through the deliberations of the Employment, Social Policy, Health, and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO), reinvigorate progress on the Equal Treatment Directive, fostering consensus for binding legislation aimed at combating discrimination across all EU member states. Beyond addressing discrimination, the Directive could be strengthened to encompass measures that promote social cohesion and inclusion at every level of society, ensuring that equality is not only a legal principle but also a practical reality. By encouraging coordinated policies and sharing best practices, the Presidency can help create a more inclusive European Union, where diversity is respected, equal opportunities are guaranteed, and social solidarity is reinforced across communities. Promoting Just, Sustainable, and Secure Food Systems The Agriculture and Fisheries Council (AGRIFISH) will consider how to implement the post-2027 CAP Strategic Plans, alongside priorities such as farm income, competitiveness, climate adaptation, simplification, and food security.The Irish Presidency could ensure that post-CAP plans reflect that no region should be exploited for another’s advantage, adopting new practices and economic models for production, consumption, distribution, and trade. Food systems should uphold justice and reflect humanity’s interconnection, with agricultural trade conducted fairly and without creating excessive dependency. EU policies should enable all countries to pursue food sovereignty, strengthen resilience to ecological, economic, or other pressures, and maintain independent decision-making. Given the central role of farming in Irish society, the Presidency could also explore how the CAP supports educational initiatives for young people. Encouraging youth to engage sustainably in agriculture is essential to foster a new generation of farmers who can apply their skills to develop context-appropriate technologies, support communities, and enhance food security in an economically viable and environmentally just way."

By expanding and sustaining these spaces for dialogue—bringing together local communities, municipalities, and EU staff working on relevant dossiers—the Presidency can ensure that regional and EU-level policies are informed by the lived realities of citizens. This approach not only enhances the relevance and effectiveness of policies but also strengthens the process of reading of the social reality and increases trust and cohesion between institutions and the people they serve. More fundamentally, reorienting relationships between institutions and grassroots actors toward a mutually supportive model can unlock the vast reservoir of creativity, expertise, and constructive capacity that exists across individuals and communities throughout Europe."

Framing EU action as a way to promote not only European prosperity but also the wellbeing of all of humanity makes Europe’s purpose tangible and meaningful, especially at a time when citizens are increasingly aware of and concerned about the suffering and challenges faced by people all around the world. By strengthening consultative frameworks that bring together local communities, municipalities, civil society, and EU institutions, the Presidency can ensure that EU policies respond to the lived realities of people on the ground. Grassroots engagement—through public consultations, town halls, digital plaqorms, and participatory initiatives—can foster a sense of shared responsibility, demonstrating how citizens’ voices shape Europe’s agenda. Communicating the Presidency’s work in this way underscores the principle that Europe’s strength, security, and prosperity are inseparable from the wellbeing of the wider world.

For workers across Ireland and Europe, delivering decent pay, secure work, strong collective bargaining, and fair conditions is essential to building a competitive and sustainable European economy. Our recommendation is strongly supported by existing EU commitments: The Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, endorsed by the Taoiseach and EU leaders, commits the European Union to creating good jobs. President von der Leyen’s Political Priorities for the 2024–2029 Commission included a Quality Jobs Roadmap to support fair wages, good working conditions, training, fair transitions, and -crucially- increased collective bargaining coverage. Published in early December 2025, the Quality Jobs Roadmap contains a strong commitment to improving job quality and creating high-quality and future-proof jobs in Europe. The forthcoming Quality Jobs Act should ensure workers’ rights while keeping the EU up with technological, climatic and societal changes. The Joint Declaration on the EU Legislative Priorities for 2025 emphasises that promoting quality jobs is essential to Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness. The Danish Presidency Programme commits to active engagement with the Commission’s Quality Jobs Roadmap. The (draft) Cypriot Presidency Programme also commits to advancing policies that promote quality employment. In addition, all European social partners—ETUC, BusinessEurope, SMEUnited—together with the institutions, have recognised in the Val Duchesse Tripartite Declaration (31 January 2024) that Europe’s long-term competitiveness must go hand in hand with quality jobs. SIPTU, as part of the ICTU and the ETUC, fully supports this shared position. Prioritising Quality Jobs during Ireland’s Presidency would help drive progress on initiatives that are of direct value to all Member States and build on the ongoing work of the Council. It would also align with the Commission’s forthcoming legislation: with the Quality Jobs Act expected in late 2026 during the Irish Presidency. Ireland can and should play a lead role in this initiative. Quality jobs will also form a key component of several dossiers that will be active during the Irish Presidency, including: the new Action Plan for the European Pillar of Social Rights, the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, the Gender Equality Strategy 2026–2030 the Fair Labour Mobility Package Finally, the Government has already signalled its support. In his address to Eurofound’s Foundation Forum on 20 November 2025, the Taoiseach welcomed the Commission’s Quality Jobs Roadmap and described it as setting “an ambitious employment agenda for the EU to remain competitive, innovative and fair, and create a level playing field that prioritises high standards for quality jobs.” Roxana Mînzatu, Executive Vice-President for Social Rights and Skills, Quality Jobs and Preparedness also addressed the event in Dublin. Given this clear national and European alignment, SIPTU believes it is both logical and necessary for Ireland to make Quality Jobs a flagship priority of its Presidency in 2026 thereby delivering tangible improvements for workers in Ireland and across Europe."

But we cannot over-emphasise the importance of the Irish Presidency addressing and being seen to address the main day-to-day cost of living challenges facing workers and their families, especially low pay, insecure work, exorbitant housing costs, rising energy prices, which were identified as the most important issues in Member States (including in Ireland), according to the most recent Eurobarometer survey (Standard Eurobarometer 103) carried out in Spring 2025. The European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 committed to address the aspirations of citizens. The most effective way of Ireland doing this as far as workers are concerned would be by strengthening and developing the EU’s framework on social dialogue and collective bargaining and advancing the next steps recommended in the Quality Jobs Roadmap agenda during its Council Presidency."

Finally, we also follow all relevant updates at the EU level on this policy area in light of our membership of the EDF and EASPD.",1,"Ireland’s Presidency of the EU presents a unique opportunity to demonstrate leadership on equality, inclusion, and human rights at a European level in line with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029. Highlighting the value of a social and inclusive Europe. It will coincide domestically with the implementation of the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People (2025), offering a timely platform to show Ireland’s commitment to the UN CRPD in action. At a European level, initiatives and policy developments of significant during the Irish presidency, include the second phase of the European Disability Rights Strategy; implementation of the European Accessibility Act and policy focus on affordable housing, poverty reduction and climate change, offer an opportunity to strengthen disability mainstreaming. The EU must deliver on its commitments under the EU Pillar of Social Rights e.g. r Principle 17, with a new Action Plan to be adopted by the end of 2025, and ongoing commitments to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Against this backdrop of human rights commitments seeking to leave no one behind, Ireland has the opportunity to support the EU’s progress towards becoming a true Union of Equality. However, this cannot be achieved without ensuring the rights of marginalised groups are respected and advanced. Considering the current political climate and advancing climate crisis, upholding human rights standards is more important than ever. Ireland can support the realignment of the EU with its core values outlined in its Strategic Agenda, notably: “respect for human rights (including the rights of persons belonging to minorities – which remain a cornerstone of our Union)”. We propose the following thematic priorities: The Advancement of Disability Rights – In light of Ireland’s recent publication of its Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People and the EU’s soon to be updated Disability Rights Strategy, ‘the advancement of disability rights across the Union’ should be prioritised. The Taoiseach has identified disability as a key government priority – and thus should be reflected in the Irish presidency. One in four adults in the EU live with a disability. Ireland can raise the visibility of the EU’s largest minority group, a group anyone can join at any point in their life. The Commission will update the EU Disability Rights Strategy 2021–2030 in the second quarter of 2026, making such a focus timely. Moreover, the EU Parliament Disability Rights Week, International Day of Persons with Disabilities, International Day of Sign Languages, and Human Rights Day fall within the Irish Presidency. In a world where respect for human dignity and rights is increasingly under attack, the EU is a vital guarantor to progress the full and equal participation of disabled people. Reinforce a Social Europe through inclusive growth that combats poverty and invests in society. DFI highly values being part of the EU project and supports its vision for a Social Europe. This involves advancing the 2030 Agenda that seeks to leave no one behind. Ireland should prioritise working to re-align the EU’s actions with its commitments under the UN SDGs, particularly on combatting poverty. The concept of leaving no one behind relates to the context in which we find ourselves – political unrest, war, climate crisis, and threat to democratic values. Ireland’s Presidency term will be timely, considering the lack of movement as planned during the Danish Presidency on key areas like the EU Equal Treatment Directive, Anti-Poverty Strategy, the Affordable Housing Plan, and the EU Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan. It is essential that the EU combats disability poverty - 28.7% of persons with disabilities are at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU, compared to 17.9% for persons without disabilities. Equally 11% of persons with disabilities in the EU report being overburdened by the cost of their housing, and only 28.9% consider their dwelling meets their needs."

Finally, we also follow all relevant updates at the EU level on this policy area in light of our membership of the EDF and EASPD.",2,"EU Disability Rights Strategy: During Ireland’s Presidency, the new flagship initiatives under the Strategy should be adopted (planned for Q2 2026). Ambitious initiatives and concrete actions in line with EU Parliament recommendations, and the recent concluding observations of the UN CRPD Committee are necessary. Ireland can ensure that the flagships also align with the detailed recommendations of the European Disability Forum. A focus on addressing employment of disabled people can help to redeem Ireland’s poor reputation, with one of the worst disability employment gaps (38.2%). EU Equal Treatment Directive: Denmark, during its Presidency, aims to reach Council unanimity on the EU Equal Treatment Directive, however it is unlikely that this will be achieved. It is crucial that the EU adopts this Directive, which has been blocked for 17 years by some Member States. Given the current environment, this Directive should be prioritised – to reach Council unanimity, or if this has been achieved, to prioritise implementation. De-prioritisation would represent a backslide on equality and caving to anti-democratic actors. This Directive would prohibit both indirect and direct discrimination based on disability and would apply the principle of “equal treatment” on grounds including disability - across a wide range of areas. EU Pillar of Social Rights and new Action Plan: The implementation of the EPSR Action Plan should be prioritised, including targeted measures for people with disabilities; for instance, implementing the Adequate Minimum Wage Directive, Platform Work Directive and a new 'quality job target' to promote decent work (EESC Opinion). The EESC urges the establishment of ambitious EU-wide standards to combat in-work poverty. These actions would complement measures included in the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy and align with commitments to combat poverty under the SDGs. Upcoming EU Anti-Poverty Strategy: Considering the upcoming publication (Q2 2026) of the EU’s Anti-Poverty Strategy, and our emphasis on defending a Social Europe, Ireland can pay a positive role in arguing for an ambitious approach to eradicating poverty. Socio-economic issues need to be addressed to cut across the divisions which are being exploited by far-right forces across the EU. Ireland can be a unifier in this area and support careful targeting of those groups with higher levels of poverty (including disabled people). EU Affordable Housing Plan: The first EU-level housing strategy will be adopted in Q2 2026, meaning implementation will begin as Ireland takes up the Presidency. Ireland should work to ensure the Plan has a specific focus on increasing the stock of housing accessible to disabled people. We can also work to change the narrative on housing - to recognise affordable and accessible homes as a fundamental right. Ireland is well-positioned given that one of its former TDs, Eamon Ryan, is Chair of the EU’s independent Housing Advisory Board. EU Accessibility Act: The CRPD Committee’s recent concluding observations to the EU, raised concerns about the limited scope and delays transposing the European Accessibility Act (EAA). The EU is obliged under UN CRPD Article 9 on Accessibility, to ensure disabled people have access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, transport, information and communication, and digital services. Without full and effective implementation of the EAA, these rights remain unrealised, leaving disabled people unable to participate equally in European society."

Finally, we also follow all relevant updates at the EU level on this policy area in light of our membership of the EDF and EASPD.",3,"Take a rights-based and intersectional approach: The Presidency is an opportunity for Ireland to ensure the protection of fundamental rights is firmly on the EU agenda. To do so Ireland should lead by example, keeping the EU core values and principles central to every action and decision it takes during its Presidency term. This approach recognises and treats each individual as a rights-holder with autonomy and dignity. Moreover, it recognises each person’s layers of identities e.g. age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, language, ethnicity, amongst others, which inform their diverse lived experiences. Taking a rights-based approach will have a positive impact not only on disabled people across the EU, but in fact on all communities. Emphasise a Social Europe: Europe and the world are undergoing turbulent times, with ongoing crises and social cohesion under threat. While in many countries (including Ireland) economic growth is continuing, significant swathes of the population constantly live with low incomes, in deprivation and feel marginalised. An unbalanced focus only on economic growth will not deliver social progress or support social cohesion, and risks gains being accrued by only a subset of the population. Moreover, the negative impact of austerity are still being felt by individuals and many community and voluntary organisations whose core funding has still not returned to pre-austerity levels, despite significant economic growth. Ireland can support the EU to re-focus its attention and agenda on societal, as well as economic needs. This can emphasise a return to economic progress to feed society, social development and support those who are more economically vulnerable in our society at EU level. Mainstream Disability Rights in the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028-2034): Ireland’s Presidency will take place during formative negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). This presents an opportunity for Ireland to treat disability rights as an essential requirement across EU investment. Ireland should prioritise embedding accessibility, reasonable accommodation, universal design, and UN CRPD compliance as core funding conditions within the next MFF. The UN CPRD Committee, in its March 2025 Concluding Observations to the EU, emphasised this. Equally, EU funds have been a key tool to support the employment of persons with disabilities in the open labour market across the EU. But despite the use of EU funds for this objective, the gap in employment rates between persons with and without disabilities stands at 24 percentage points and has not improved over the past decade."

Finally, we also follow all relevant updates at the EU level on this policy area in light of our membership of the EDF and EASPD.",4,"Via a Disability Accessible Presidency – considering (i) the EU is the only regional entity to have ratified the CRPD, (ii) commitments therefore under Article 9 on accessibility, and (ii) with ongoing Member State’s implementation of the EU Accessibility Act, Ireland’s presidency should aim to be fully accessible to disabled people. Moreover, Article 29 of the CRPD, obliges State Parties to ensure that disabled people can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others. Not only will mainstreaming accessibility measures ensuring disabled people can follow the Irish presidency, but also that they can actively participate in and engage with it on an equal basis with others. Ireland has the opportunity to champion accessibility throughout the course of its presidency. This would involve ensuring all information and communication is provided in ISL (as one of Ireland’s 3 national languages), plain English and easy-to-read formats e.g. on the Irish Presidency webpage. Moreover, the webpage should be screen reader compatible. This will create a sense of ownership of Ireland’s Presidency by its disabled citizens. Any events held by the Irish Presidency should ensure physical accessibility, International Sign interpretation, and live captioning is provided given the international audience. EU supporting progress on equality in Ireland: The EU has been a positive force for social development, equality and human rights in Europe and internationally. Many of the positive developments in Ireland’s equality approach and legal frameworks etc. have their origin in the EU. The values of equality, diversity, and equity are central to the EU’s foundation in post-war Europe and have been integral to Ireland’s journey as member of the EU. Emphasising this when communicating the EU Presidency can help to re-affirm social values and a social agenda and orientation for the EU."

Among other things, it urges the Commission to pay particular attention to the extra cost of living of persons with disabilities, the situation of women and girls with disabilities, mental health among persons with disabilities, and to people with invisible disabilities. Some of the proposed actions for inclusion in the second half of the Strategy include: An EU-funded Employment and Skills Guarantee for persons with disabilities. Continued efforts to improve the freedom of movement of persons with disabilities throughout the EU. Strengthening the European accessibility centre AccessibleEU, through the creation of a dedicated permanent regulatory agency.

Three linked themes follow. A Peaceful and Principled Europe Ireland should explicitly frame its Presidency around human security, diplomacy and respect for international law. That means resisting the drift toward an EU military union and promoting conflict prevention, arms control, peacebuilding and non-violent resolution of disputes. Ireland, with its tradition of UN peacekeeping and constitutional commitment to neutrality, is uniquely placed to lead this conversation. A Europe that Ends Complicity in War and Occupation The EU’s credibility in the Global South is being destroyed by visible double standards. During Ireland’s Presidency, the Union should commit to applying international humanitarian and human rights law consistently, including in Palestine. That means: ending exports of weapons and dual-use goods to states committing grave breaches of international law, demanding an immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza, and supporting genuine political solutions based on equality and self-determination. A Just, Sustainable and Caring Europe The EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 is framed around a “strong and secure Europe” and competitiveness. Ireland should rebalance this by putting social protection, public health, decent work and climate justice at the centre of “security”. A Europe that pours hundreds of billions into armaments while people cannot afford housing, energy or care is not secure. Cross-cutting all three themes should be: protection of civil liberties and shrinking civic space; support for trade unions, social dialogue and workers’ rights; climate action that does not push new extractive frontiers onto vulnerable communities at home or abroad. In short, Ireland should choose a Presidency vision that says clearly: security is not tanks and drones, but peace, rights, strong public services and a consistent commitment to international law, from Ukraine to Palestine."
23,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6fe35abf/Individual_submission_-_Submission_23.docx,,Individual,Health / non-profit,EU wide,2,"From a neutrality and human-rights perspective, Ireland should concentrate its Presidency efforts on areas where Council decisions can quickly reduce human suffering and restrain militarisation. Arms exports and EU defence funding Champion a review and tightening of the EU Common Position on Arms Exports, so that no weapons or components are exported to states credibly accused of war crimes, including in Gaza, Yemen and elsewhere. Use negotiations on EU budget and defence instruments (including new defence loan and Readiness-type schemes) to redirect funds from weapons procurement toward civil resilience: health, housing, climate adaptation and energy poverty measures. Push for full transparency on arms licences, end-use monitoring and public reporting. International law and Palestine Seek Council conclusions that commit the EU to: supporting investigations by the International Criminal Court and other accountability mechanisms; defending the jurisdiction of international courts; and applying human-rights clauses in all association and trade agreements consistently, including with Israel. Promote practical measures such as: banning settlement products, suspending cooperation that directly or indirectly sustains illegal occupation, and significantly increasing civilian and UN-led humanitarian support. Migration, asylum and externalisation Use the Presidency to slow and, where possible, reverse the trend toward Fortress Europe and outsourcing border control to authoritarian regimes. Prioritise safe and legal routes, fair responsibility-sharing, protection at sea, and an end to practices that expose people on the move to torture, pushbacks and detention in inhuman conditions. Civil liberties, digital rights and the AI Act implementation Focus Council work on protecting civic space, safeguarding journalists, whistle-blowers and human rights defenders, and preventing surveillance technologies from being used against peaceful dissent. Ensure implementation of the AI Act and other digital legislation is anchored in fundamental rights, not security rhetoric. Climate, energy and social protection In negotiations on the Clean Industrial Deal, energy and climate files, Ireland should argue that every euro redirected from social and climate spending into armaments weakens real security. Prioritise measures that reduce energy poverty, support community-owned renewables, and create decent green jobs rather than subsidising fossil-fuel lock-in or extractive mega-projects. The overarching Presidency aim should be clear: to re-orient EU decision-making away from militarisation and toward human security, solidarity and respect for international law."
23,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6fe35abf/Individual_submission_-_Submission_23.docx,,Individual,Health / non-profit,EU wide,3,"Council work under Ireland’s Presidency can improve daily life across the Union if it is guided by three tests: Does this decision reduce human suffering? Does it strengthen democracy? Does it shift resources from war to welfare? Deliver visible social gains Ireland should prioritise progress on files that ease the cost-of-living crisis: measures on energy affordability, tenants’ rights, fair wages, and platform workers; stronger protections for public health; and support for quality public services. When people see hospitals, schools and housing improved, Europe feels real. Advance peace and de-escalation The Presidency should use every diplomatic tool to press for ceasefires, prisoner exchanges and political solutions in conflicts affecting Europe, while insisting on accountability for all serious violations of international law. That includes ending EU complicity in the devastation of Gaza and supporting a just peace in Palestine, alongside continued support for Ukraine grounded in international law and diplomacy. Peace work has direct benefits: fewer refugees fleeing war, less pressure on public budgets for weapons, and more resources for community needs. Protect small businesses and workers, not just multinationals Council negotiations on competition, trade and industrial policy should favour SMEs, co-operatives and local economies, ensuring fair taxation of large corporations and digital giants. This can include pushing for stronger EU-level action against tax avoidance and profit-shifting, so that public revenues are available for social and climate priorities. Strengthen democracy from the bottom up Ireland can make the Presidency a model of participatory democracy by embedding structured dialogue with trade unions, NGOs, migrant groups, youth movements and faith communities in the Council’s work. If minority voices, including Palestinian, migrant and traveller communities, are heard in Presidency-linked forums, decisions will reflect Europe as it actually is. Reframe “security” as human security Instead of allowing “security and defence” to mean ever-growing military budgets, Ireland should push the Council toward a human-security paradigm: food, energy and housing security, climate stability, and freedom from fear of war, racist violence or state repression. A Presidency that brings concrete improvements to social protection, peace efforts and democratic participation will leave a legacy that citizens, communities and ethical businesses can genuinely feel and own."

It should be honest, participatory and rooted in lived experience. Be candid about both benefits and failures People will trust the Presidency more if it acknowledges shortcomings: from austerity policies to the EU’s role in militarisation and migration tragedies. Explain clearly where Ireland intends to do things differently - for example, on peace, Palestine, asylum, and social justice - and report publicly on what was or was not achieved. Bring the Presidency to communities, not just Brussels and Dublin Hold local “EU and Our Community” assemblies in towns, rural areas and estates, in partnership with schools, trade unions, NGOs and parish groups. Use these to listen first, then explain concretely how Council decisions affect housing, work, farms, hospitals and climate. Ensure formats that work for migrants, people with disabilities, young people and those with limited English. Centre stories of solidarity, not slogans Show, through human stories, how EU decisions can protect rights, support workers, and stand with oppressed peoples. Palestinians, Ukrainians, refugees, frontline health staff and care workers should all be visible in Presidency communications as partners, not props. Use independent voices and critical allies Rather than only official spokespeople, involve trade unionists, academics, community organisers, faith leaders and youth activists as commentators and co-hosts of Presidency events. Let them criticise as well as praise. This shared, sometimes uncomfortable, conversation creates real ownership. Invest in civic education, especially for young people Support schools and youth groups to run critical, participatory programmes on how the EU works, what the Council does, and how decisions on war, climate and migration are made. Link these to Presidency events, but keep control in the hands of teachers, students and youth workers rather than turning them into PR exercises. If Ireland communicates its Presidency as a joint project with citizens - including those most affected by war, poverty and exclusion - then EU membership will feel less like something done to people and more like something done with them."

It would analyse the legal and political risks of deeper EU militarisation, including joint debt for arms, pressure to reach very high defence-spending targets, and the merging of civilian and military research. It would argue that Ireland’s Presidency should instead promote demilitarisation, arms control and investment in civil resilience. EU complicity in Israel’s violations of international law A second section would document how EU trade, research and arms flows link to Israel’s occupation and the destruction in Gaza, drawing on UN reports and human rights organisations. It would outline concrete levers available to the Council and Member States: arms embargoes, suspension or restriction of agreements that enable serious violations, and support for accountability processes. The argument would be simple: the EU cannot claim to stand for a “rules-based international order” while enabling collective punishment and permanent occupation. A human-security budget for the Union A third section would examine ongoing debates on the EU’s long-term budget and new defence instruments, highlighting how funds could instead be redirected toward housing, healthcare, climate adaptation, just transition and global solidarity. It would propose criteria for assessing every new initiative: does this spending reduce structural violence, inequality and climate risk, or does it fuel them? Overall, the attached material would reinforce the central claim of this submission: that Ireland’s 2026 Presidency should be remembered not for how efficiently it armed Europe, but for how bravely it used a small country’s voice to defend peace, neutrality, Palestine and the basic idea that human lives matter more than weapons or GDP."

This should include an effective anti-poverty strategy that addresses its root causes, ensuring income adequacy and access to social infrastructure and public services. Enhancing civil society participation and deepening our democracy. Renewed emphasis on a Just Transition as we decarbonise our economy. Ireland has a long positive history of progressing a social agenda in the European Union. In its Presidency in 2026, Ireland can shape and drive an agenda focused on a renewal of social cohesion and societal wellbeing; seeking to ensure that all citizens can participate fully in economic, social and cultural life. There are significant risks for the EU and its member states in overly focusing on economic growth over social development – including reduced trust among individuals, institutions and the state, greater fragmentation, and erosion of the social contract. Indeed, while imperfect, Ireland’s increased focus on wellbeing is an approach we can promote at EU level. Likewise, Ireland’s ongoing practice of social dialogue and civic participation is an approach to good governance that we should deepen and promote at EU level. With the current negotiation on the Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2028-2034, Ireland’s Presidency of the EU can play a key role in the finalisation of the MFF to preserve the financial sustainability of a social and democratic Europe."

Ringfenced funding under the “cohesion” areas of investment are crucial to maintain momentum in this area and make inroads in facing challenges many Member States face. Anti-Poverty Strategy The publication of the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy marks a key opportunity to address the erosion of incomes and falling wealth equality across member states. Recognising Ireland’s long history of robust social protection structures and our own anti-poverty targets, we should ensure targeted measures are matched with ambitious investment to ensure poverty is no longer a major risk for so many people living in the EU today. European Pillar of Social Rights The renewal of this Pillar is an essential policy tool to drive policy coherence in social measures and to address social inequalities. Of importance is the inclusion of the “working poor” as a vulnerable group that requires support, as well as the need to strengthen minimum incomes across member states. Severe housing shortages should also be of focus as a major driver of precarity and social exclusion. There is an opportunity to ensure the objectives within the Pillar are made enforceable via integration with MFF processes, keeping the vision of a “social Europe” to the fore in this period."

The clause states that “In defining and implementing its policies and activities, the Union shall take into account requirements linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection, the fight against social exclusion, and a high level of education, training and protection of human health.” Embedding this social clause is necessary to create a positive impact for all member states and their citizens. Greater coherence of European economic, environmental and social policy in support of a social Europe can be done by acting on the von der Leyen Commission’s decision to integrate the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the European Pillar of Social Rights into the economic processes of the European Semester. Further actions to develop this include: Making the European Pillar of Social Rights enforceable through legislative initiatives, including the Multiannual Financial Framework and turning it into a strategic tool to influence EU macroeconomic governance. Taking greater account of social impacts when making Country-specific Recommendations, especially those requiring fiscal consolidation measures, and ensure no return of austerity policy. Making Country-specific Recommendations that seek to achieve reductions in poverty, where rates are high or rising."

There is a key opportunity for the State to partner with other national and regional organisations with members across the country, as they have the best connections and insight into how to effectively promote the Presidency within their jurisdiction. Partnership participation with community organisations can be an effective strategy to run engaging events and ensure people can be empowered to participate in activities and gain further insights of the benefits of EU membership and decision making structures. A key determinant of the success of this approach is to ensure adequate funding is provided to ensure organisations can fully participate and develop strategic initiatives that will serve their members effectively."

The EU’s international dimension under the European Water Resilience Strategy aims to “reinforce the EU’s role in promoting water resilience worldwide through international partnerships and cooperation.” The Presidency should champion: Implementation of the global Water Action Agenda commitments, ensuring the EU delivers on access to safe drinking water and sanitation, ecosystem restoration, and transboundary-water cooperation. Strengthened diplomacy for water, embedding water security into the EU’s foreign policy, humanitarian aid, and climate diplomacy — consistent with the Council’s prior calls for water as a tool for peace, security, development and human dignity. Mobilization of international finance and partnerships (development banks, multilateral organisations, private sector) to support water and sanitation infrastructure globally, nature-based water restoration, and integrated water-resource management. This mirrors the Strategy’s emphasis on cooperation, research, innovation, and financing. What the Irish Presidency should aim to achieve: A clear EU roadmap for delivering on the Water Action Agenda by 2030 — with measurable contributions to SDG 6 globally (safe water, sanitation, ecosystem restoration). Institutionalisation of water diplomacy across EU external action, including enhanced transboundary water-management cooperation with partner countries, especially in regions exposed to water stress. Strategic alignment of EU external financing — via development cooperation and multilateral banks — to water resilience, with focus on water infrastructure, ecosystem restoration, sanitation, and sustainable water-resource management globally. By doing so, the Irish Presidency would strengthen the EU’s global role on water, uphold its international commitments, and help shape a more resilient, equitable water future worldwide — ahead of and beyond the 2026 UN Water Conference."

Citizens and businesses increasingly expect the Union to deliver clarity, transparency, innovation and strong protection standards, while the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 emphasises competitiveness, resilience and democratic renewal as central priorities for the coming years. These overarching objectives offer a clear orientation for Ireland as it opens the next Council cycle. PETA recommends that Ireland structure its Presidency around two broad, forward-looking themes that reflect the Union’s strategic direction and the urgent need to accelerate Europe’s transition away from animal testing toward modern, humane, and scientifically advanced approaches. By placing replacement technologies at the heart of its Presidency, Ireland can reinforce both Europe’s scientific and economic foundations and its democratic values. Theme 1 – A Competitive, Innovative and High-Standards Europe for People, Animals and the Environment This theme aligns closely with the Strategic Agenda’s ambition to foster “a prosperous and competitive Europe.” Strengthening long-term competitiveness requires a regulatory environment that is coherent, predictable and grounded in excellent science. A Presidency anchored in this theme would lend strong support to innovation, the functioning of the Single Market and the development of modern, efficient governance structures. Ireland is well positioned to highlight the importance of research excellence, regulatory consistency and high protection standards as core components of a resilient and future-ready European economy. Emphasising the value of clear, transparent and science-led decision-making and championing non- animal replacement technologies would help create the conditions for high-quality jobs, sustainable growth and Europe’s leadership in the green and digital transitions. Theme 2 – A Cohesive and Values-Driven Union This theme reflects the Strategic Agenda’s priority of building “a free and democratic Europe,” grounded in the principles of dignity, equality, human rights and the rule of law. As societal and technological transitions accelerate, strengthening public trust and ensuring transparent, accountable decision-making are essential for maintaining confidence in the European project. Ireland has a long-standing reputation for promoting inclusive, evidence-based and participatory governance. A Presidency shaped around this theme would reinforce democratic legitimacy by supporting clarity in policymaking, meaningful citizen engagement and value-driven approaches across the Council’s work. Central to this is recognising citizens’ growing demand for ethical science and stronger protections for animals. By advancing policies that replace animal testing with humane, humanrelevant technologies, Ireland can help deepen citizens’ sense of connection to the Union, strengthen democratic resilience, and demonstrate that European values extend to how we conduct science itself."

Building on the Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 commitments to competitiveness, innovation and strong protection standards, the Presidency can make meaningful progress on several major initiatives that require coordinated Council stewardship. 1. Modernising REACH: Spare Animals, Cut Costs, and Lead in Innovation The revision of REACH will be central to strengthening the Single Market, improving scientific quality and increasing regulatory efficiency. Ireland can advance Council discussions by supporting: A stepwise, science-led framework making non-animal approaches the default and allowing animal tests only when non-animal options are demonstrably exhausted and scientifically justified; Future-proof, performance-based, information requirements, updated as science evolves; An independent expert committee to accelerate acceptance of non-animal approaches; Greater transparency and data reuse, including reporting on animal and non-animal use and expanding data-sharing provisions; Alignment of REACH with the Cosmetics Regulation, using existing cosmetics non-animal safety data to meet REACH requirements. Evaluation of the Cosmetics Products Regulation (CPR) Ireland can reinforce consumer confidence and EU values by: Supporting a CPR revision that fully protects and enforces the bans on animal testing and marketing of animal-tested cosmetics and ingredients; Preserving the ethical and scientific integrity of the CPR while enhancing transparency and enforcement. Evaluating the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) The Presidency could promote modernisation by: Systematic reporting on non-animal and animal-test use; Non-animal approaches as the default, enforced through tiered testing and weight-of-evidence approaches; Future-proof, science-driven information requirements and regular training to build regulatory confidence in innovative approaches; Stronger data sharing and legal interoperability to prevent redundant testing and improve efficiency. Implementing the EU Roadmap to Phase Out Animal Testing for Chemical Safety Following the European Citizens’ Initiative “Save Cruelty-Free Cosmetics”, the Commission committed to a cross-sector Roadmap. We encourage the Irish Presidency to: Support coordinated implementation of the roadmap across environment, health, research and industry portfolios. Promote structured monitoring and transparent reporting on progress. Encourage cooperation between Member States, EU agencies and relevant stakeholders, to advance acceptance of non-animal approaches. Ensure that Roadmap objectives are reflected in chemicals policy discussions, including REACH implementation. Advancing the ERA Action on Non-Animal Methods in Biomedical Research and Testing Ireland can ensure coherence with the European Research Area (ERA) Policy Agenda 2025–2027, which prioritises accelerating non-animal methods in biomedical research and testing by: Supporting cooperation between Health, Environment and Research ministries; Promoting transparency and stakeholder engagement; Encouraging legislative coherence so that sectoral laws do not hinder deployment of validated non-animal approaches."

Building on this clear societal and economic mandate, the Irish Presidency can make a substantial positive impact by advancing coherent, future-ready regulatory systems that serve people, businesses and communities across the Union. The Irish Presidency has an opportunity to strengthen the EU’s capacity to deliver clear, science-based and efficient regulatory outcomes. Many of the challenges faced by stakeholders, such as complexity, inconsistent implementation and limited transparency, stem from fragmentation across existing frameworks. Addressing these issues through practical, consensus-driven Council work would contribute directly to the Strategic Agenda’s goals of competitiveness, resilience and democratic renewal. Increasing regulatory coherence and predictability for businesses, especially SMEs Businesses benefit from regulatory systems that are clear, proportionate and consistent across sectors. Progress on modernising REACH, the CPR and the BPR would improve clarity, reduce duplication and facilitate compliance, particularly for SMEs. Enhanced data-sharing, better coordination between Member States and aligned assessment principles would support innovation while reducing unnecessary burdens. Improving scientific quality and strengthening protection for citizens Accelerating the uptake of modern, human-relevant scientific approaches would improve the reliability of safety assessments, better protect human health and the environment, and ensure that EU decisions reflect state-of-the-art science. This contributes to safer products, healthier communities and a more resilient environment. Enhancing transparency to support public trust Citizens increasingly expect openness in regulatory processes. Advancing transparency in data use, assessment pathways and progress under the EU Roadmap towards phasing out animal testing would reinforce trust in EU institutions and demonstrate commitment to accountable, evidence-based policymaking. Supporting innovation and Europe’s scientific leadership Promoting cross-sector coordination and investment in advanced non-animal appraoches will help maintain Europe’s leadership in science and innovation. This not only enhances the EU’s competitiveness but also ensures more efficient use of public and private research funding. By promoting regulatory coherence, scientific excellence and transparent governance, Ireland’s Presidency can help deliver a modern, responsive and values-driven regulatory environment that benefits citizens, businesses and communities across the European Union."

The strong public mobilisation behind the European Citizens’ Initiative “Save Cruelty-Free Cosmetics – Commit to a Europe Without Animal Testing,” illustrates the value citizens place on ethical, scientifically robust and future-oriented policymaking. Communicating clearly how the EU follows up on such initiatives—and how citizen participation contributes to shaping the policy agenda, would demonstrate that democratic mechanisms function and that public input carries weight. Ireland’s Presidency could enhance visibility and public understanding by: providing clear, accessible explanations of Council deliberations and legislative progress; highlighting concrete examples of how EU cooperation improves daily life, including through safer products, stronger environmental protection and support for scientific innovation; supporting youth engagement, civil society dialogue and partnerships with educational and research institutions; using digital tools and multilingual communication to make complex policy areas more understandable and relatable to non-specialist audiences. Public-facing events, Presidency-branded communication campaigns and collaboration with the European Parliament and European Commission would help deepen citizens’ understanding of the Presidency’s role and the value of EU cooperation.

We support the development of healthcare solutions through a deep understanding of patients' experiences and medical needs. We are driving the evolution of transformative therapies, focusing on new targets with cutting-edge modalities, and we are committed to tackling disease with high unmet medical needs. Considering the global environment pharmaceutical companies face and the linked challenges on health, single market, and trade, we believe that EU’s competitiveness is necessary to reignite productivity and sustain growth while defending access to the highest quality of care & healthcare resilience. We welcome a strong health and industrial agenda, focusing on faster access to medicines and fairer access to innovation. We believe that access to innovation & patient-centered innovation pathways requires political actions to facilitate regulatory and reimbursement pathways for ATMPs, oncological therapies, biomarkers, diagnostics, and ATMPs: Precision oncology diagnostic: Access to biomarker testing remains fragmented and inequitable, limiting the real-world impact of precision oncology. Today, testing availability, reimbursement, laboratory capacity, quality assurance, and turnaround times vary dramatically between Member States. Patients in Northern and Western Europe are far more likely to receive timely, high-quality testing than those in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. Misaligned approval and reimbursement pathways for companion diagnostics, inconsistent quality standards, and lack of sustainable funding continue to restrict patient access to precision therapies. Access to combination therapies: Combination therapies are recognized as the most innovative treatment options in oncology (and beyond). Although these therapies can significantly improve patient outcomes, there are considerable challenges related to pricing models and competition laws. While pricing decisions fall under national competences, Articles 3 and 101-109 TFEU rule on common competition and the approximation of laws. Advanced Therapies (ATMPs): Incentives to support the translation of research into commercialization (from clinical trials to reimbursement) are required to scale innovation in Europe. Discoveries deliver impact when they reach patients, and a strong political commitment to innovation, reducing barriers in the single market, and harmonization of the EU system is required to reduce unpredictability across 27 national systems. Furthermore, it is the right political moment to champion for Women’s Health and Menopause, the up-coming EU equal strategy and recognizing menopause as a structural issue across the EU – it is an equality, labor, economic, and fiscal issue. Ireland has already taken leadership steps in this area, guided by the Women’s Health Action Plan 2025 and the Civil Service menopause in the workplace policy framework. This is an opportunity to take these learnings forward and champion an EU-wide approach that recognizes menopause as a key life stage requiring innovation and workplace inclusion to improve health outcomes. The workplace impacts of menopause are clear – Astellas’ Menopause Experience and Attitudes Survey found that 59% believe menopause is a taboo topic that people are uncomfortable discussing, and that 36% of women have experienced some kind of negative impact in the workplace, whether it be reduced productivity or outright discrimination."

MFN risk mitigation policy, solid industrial policy, and EU Member States' cooperation to avoid price spillovers will be fundamental for EU economies. Competitiveness: The Presidency should pursue an ambitious and earmarked budget for health within the MFF, including but not limited to the Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe, and strengthen publicprivate partnerships. Furthermore, the Presidency should ensure that the EU Critical Medicines Act proposal achieves the availability of innovative and critical medicines on the markets, strengthening manufacturing capacities in Europe, and enhancing external cooperation to reduce risks of a fragmented supply chain, which will undermine competitiveness. On the Biotech Act, the Presidency should ensure the legislation strengthens Europe’s IP framework, simplifies and harmonizes clinical trials, establishes end-to-end regulatory oversight, creates a coherent framework for advanced manufacturing, expands access to funding and investment opportunities, and harnesses digitalization and AI. Access: Ireland has been a highly influential Member States in shaping the EU HTA framework, and its 2026 Council Presidency represents a pivotal moment for implementation. It is essential that Ireland ensures the regulation delivers on its intended objectives - minimizing duplication, accelerating assessments, and enabling faster, more equitable access to innovative therapies across all Member States. Oncology: The Presidency should keep cancer (and rare cancers) high on the political agenda and therefore ensure that the Europe Beating Cancer Plan, the EU Cancer Mission receive adequate funds and political attention, as well as the EU Council’s recommendations on cancer screening are fully implemented across Europe and therefore reflected in the national cancer control plans. ATMPs: The Presidency should work on building a Europe’s biotechnology ecosystem that remains fragmented, particularly in the transition from discovery to development. Cell and gene therapies are revolutionizing the treatment of life-threatening conditions, offering durable or potentially curative outcomes for patients. This disease area is critical to drive Europe’s health and global competitiveness. Still, policy actions are required to ensure that ATMPs are invented, developed, manufactured, and delivered to patients across EU. Women’s health: The Presidency should encourage more systematic coverage of menopause within Council discussions on health cooperation, healthy ageing, equality, and economic participation. It can help create a more coherent EU approach and further investments in the next EU budget 2028 -2034 negotiations. This would strengthen outcomes for women, support businesses through improved retention and productivity, and contribute to healthier, more inclusive European communities. The period is timely, as the WHO has recently incorporated perimenopause and menopause into its life-course SRHR framework, signaling an important shift in global health attention."

European Framework for Combination Therapies: Close the access gap by ensuring that patients across Europe benefit from the most effective combination of regimen, and providing a win-win-win for patients, healthcare systems, and the innovative pharma industry, such as: Work with Member States and extend Belgian-style competition (and UK) law guidance across Europe to give companies the legal certainty required for collaborative access solutions Issue clear, EU-wide safe-harbour provisions enabling good-faith, transparent and regulator-reviewed multi-company negotiations. Ensure competition policy is aligned with public health goals, recognizing that overly restrictive interpretations can delay or deny access to life-extending cancer care. Accelerate national policy adoption by encouraging Ministries of Health and reimbursement authorities to integrate emerging methods into HTA practice. European Framework for ATMPs: Europe’s access and reimbursement frameworks have not kept pace with its industrial innovation, and the Council should ensure a more coherent policy ecosystem will improve predictability for innovators. Policy actions could include: Ensure EU funds used to develop an upskill the regulatory network to be familiar with ATMP development, clinical trials, and manufacturing. Support Member States in applying cross-border healthcare provisions to ATMPs. Promote a dialogue between the European Commission, regulators, HTA bodies, payers, and industry to enable earlier dialogue and shared expectations on value and evidence requirements. Women’s Health & Menopause: the EU/WHO cooperation in Women’s Health and Menopause aligns with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 and Draghi’s report. Policy actions could include: Encourage progress on more consistent, evidence-based menopause care across the EU, ensuring that every woman can assess a minimum-level of appropriate support regardless of where she lives, as well as great attention to menopause within discussions on EU workforce participation and productivity. Extend the Irish Women’s Health Action Plan as best practice across the EU Member States. Accelerate the evolution of a comprehensive Women’s Health/Equity strategy, with a minimum service level of menopause treatment and understanding consistent across Europe. This includes access to care, choice of treatments, and menopause education of primary care health professionals and specialists to diagnose and treat menopause symptoms, for example, hot flushes and night sweats, considered the cardinal symptoms of menopause."

It is therefore important that the Presidency will communicate to the EU citizens how the Council (and therefore all 27 Member States) is committed to guaranteeing Health, strengthening the national health care systems, supporting the economy through competition & industrial policy, as well as ensuring equality on the labor market. An effective Presidency will require cross-area cooperation, which connects trade, competitiveness, health, R&D, and beyond at EU level. This should also be translated to Member States level too. Furthermore, stakeholders’ engagement is vital for a democratic Europe, as well as including their solid expertise in specific issues. In this regard, roundtable discussions, country visits, and digital engagement could ensure that a patientcentered/industry dialogue is effective. Astellas Pharma remains available to further cooperate with the Irish Presidency, as well as our colleagues in the Irish affiliate & across the EU."

These themes align with Ireland’s foreign policy, the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, and Ireland’s campaign for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Protect rights, democracy, and the rule of law The Presidency should reaffirm that fundamental rights, including LGBTIQ+ equality, are core to the EU’s constitutional order. Attacks on LGBTIQ+ people form part of broader democratic backsliding in several Member States. The Council should place rights protection at the centre of its work, strengthen scrutiny of rule-of-law concerns, and ensure civil society participation across formations. This requires visible political leadership and clear messaging that rights are non-negotiable. Build a safer and more inclusive social Europe The Presidency should address inequality, hate crime, and violence through coordinated action. LGBTIQ+ people experience higher rates of poverty, homelessness, and mental health distress. These realities link directly to wider EU priorities in housing, youth, health, and employment. The Presidency should support measures that strengthen community safety, improve data collection, and promote inclusive access to services. A coherent social agenda reduces polarisation and strengthens cohesion. Position the EU as a values-based global actor In the period leading to Ireland’s UN Human Rights Council campaign, the Presidency should demonstrate that internal and external human rights commitments are aligned. This includes supporting human rights defenders, strengthening the EU’s global work on equality, and ensuring consistent positions in UN fora. Ireland is well placed to lead this work due to its international reputation on equality and its long-standing engagement with civil society. The Presidency should also advance the new EU LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2026–2030. This strategy is essential for coordinating equality work across institutions, promoting best practice, and ensuring accountability. Progress on this file would show that the EU remains committed to strengthening rights at a time of increasing political pressure. Ireland should use its own National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy as a reference point. This demonstrates national leadership and helps ground Presidency priorities in lived experience. These three LGBTQ+ themes give the Presidency coherence and clarity. They respond to real community needs across Europe and highlight Ireland’s strengths as a country that values equality, inclusion, and democratic stability. Ireland’s role in hosting major European equality events in this period further strengthens the case for a Presidency anchored in rights and democratic values."

EU LGBTIQ Equality Strategy 2026–2030 The Presidency should secure meaningful progress on the next EU strategy. This includes stronger cross-Council coordination, structured engagement with civil society, and improved monitoring of Member State commitments. A clear Council mandate is essential to protect consistency and avoid fragmentation across formations. Free movement and family recognition The Presidency should prioritise the Regulation on parenthood recognition and press for alignment with established CJEU case law. Families must retain their legal status when moving across borders. Ensuring mutual recognition is critical for mobility, worker rights, and children’s wellbeing. Hate crime, hate speech, and digital safety The Presidency should advance work on the Eurocrimes extension and ensure coordinated action against online hate and targeted disinformation. Rising anti-LGBTIQ hate threatens safety and undermines trust in democratic institutions. The Presidency should promote better national data systems and stronger cooperation between law enforcement bodies. Ending conversion practices The Presidency should support EU-level work that helps Member States introduce bans covering sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. Any EU approach should include safeguards that protect access to gender-affirming healthcare and mental health supports. Clarity on this point is essential to avoid harm. Asylum and migration The Presidency should ensure that the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum includes safeguards for vulnerable groups, including LGBTIQ refugees. This requires attention to reception conditions, privacy, fair procedures, and independent monitoring. Cooperation with the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and civil society should be standard practice. 6. External action and Ireland’s UN campaign The Presidency should promote Council conclusions reaffirming LGBTIQ rights in the EU’s external work. This includes support for human rights defenders, strategic engagement with partner countries, and consistent positions at the UN. Ireland’s leadership in this area would strengthen its credibility during the Human Rights Council campaign. These areas offer clear pathways for progress and demonstrate that the EU delivers for people in concrete ways. They also align with Ireland’s domestic commitments and the needs identified by LGBTIQ organisations across Europe."

Housing, community safety, and protection from discrimination are deeply connected, and progress in these areas will support a more stable and confident Union. Housing, homelessness, and social cohesion The housing crisis across Europe is one of the main pressures shaping public sentiment. Insecure housing, overcrowding, and rising homelessness are driving social frustration, weakening trust in institutions, and creating conditions that allow extremist and far-right narratives to take hold. These dynamics directly affect LGBTIQ people, who already face higher risks of homelessness due to family rejection, discrimination, and economic inequality. The Presidency should frame housing as a core element of community stability. Investment in affordable housing, protections for vulnerable groups, and better coordination across Member States will strengthen social cohesion. Communities with secure housing are more resilient, less isolated, and less susceptible to polarising messaging. Addressing housing is essential to building safer communities and reducing the conditions in which hate thrives. Safer communities Clearer protections against hate crime and hate speech remain vital. Anti-LGBTIQ hate, anti-migrant sentiment, and online harassment are rising across Europe. These trends undermine community safety and weaken public trust. Stronger enforcement (online and offline), better data, and coordinated action between Member States will help protect people and stabilise communities. Fairer workplaces and easier mobility Consistent recognition of families across the Union supports mobility and strengthens workforce participation. People can relocate for work with confidence when their family rights are secure. Clear non-discrimination rules help businesses create safer workplaces, support talent retention, and reduce conflict. When workers feel protected, they invest more in their roles and contribute to stronger local economies. Stronger integration for refugees and migrants LGBTIQ refugees face higher risk of violence, exploitation, and social isolation. Fair procedures, safe reception systems, and independent oversight help people rebuild their lives and participate in their communities. These measures improve outcomes for individuals and promote cohesion within host communities. Practical actions for the Presidency Connect work on equality with EU-level efforts to address housing and homelessness. Support coordinated action on hate crime, online safety, and data collection. Promote mutual recognition of families to strengthen worker mobility. Highlight best practice on reception, integration, and community safety. Encourage joint engagement between civil society, local authorities, and Member States. A Presidency focused on these areas will support safer communities, stronger participation, and a more cohesive society, conditions that are essential for democratic stability across the Union."

This requires clear communication, engagement in trusted spaces, and a focus on lived experience. Show real stories People understand EU values when they see their impact. The Presidency should highlight stories of families recognised across borders, young people moving for education, workers protected by equality law, and LGBTIQ refugees who find safety. These stories make European cooperation concrete and connect policy to everyday life. Engage communities directly The Presidency should meet people where they are. Events should take place in community centres, youth services, arts spaces, migrant organisations, LGBTIQ centres, and local libraries. These settings create trust, draw in people who are rarely reached by EU institutions, and support open conversation. Make communication simple and accessible Clear information strengthens ownership. The Presidency should produce short explainers and visual guides on free movement, family rights, digital protections, and community safety. Translations and plain English should be standard. Materials should be designed for use in schools, workplaces, and community settings. Create space for dialogue Ownership grows when people feel heard. The Presidency should hold town-hall meetings, roundtables, community discussions, and online Q&A sessions. These formats enable people to question decision-makers directly and provide feedback grounded in their lived experiences. Build trust to counter disinformation Disinformation targets groups already at risk. The Presidency should work with educators, civil society partners, and local leaders to provide accurate information about EU decisions. Trusted messengers are essential. This approach builds confidence and reduces the influence of polarising narratives. Use major equality events to strengthen engagement Ireland has a unique opportunity in October 2026, when Outhouse LGBTQ+ Centre together with LGBT Ireland will host the ILGA-Europe Annual Meeting in Dublin. This gathering, supported by Government partners, will bring more than 400 activists and experts from 52 countries across Europe and Central Asia. The Presidency should integrate this event into its communications and engagement work. It is a rare moment to show Ireland’s leadership, support dialogue between Member States and civil society, and reinforce the EU’s commitment to dignity and inclusion. Practical actions for the Presidency Launch a “Europe in Communities” outreach programme through civic and cultural spaces. Develop short, accessible guides on key rights and protections. Establish an at-risk populations advisory panel for Presidency communications. Create a digital hub with real stories, practical tools, and participation opportunities. Use the ILGA-Europe Annual Meeting as a platform for Presidency dialogues on rights and community safety for LGBTQ+ people. These actions will make the Presidency visible, relatable, and genuinely participatory. They will help people see the EU as something they shape, not something distant."

Our recommendations are based on daily engagement with people whose lives are shaped by EU policy and who depend on strong protections in areas such as mobility, safety, asylum, and access to services. We see the impact of EU decisions first-hand. Rules on family recognition affect whether people can live and work across borders. Digital policy influences the safety of LGBTIQ people online. Asylum procedures shape the experiences of refugees who rely on fair treatment and safe reception. These issues are not abstract. They define the lived reality of many people who pass through our doors each week. The Presidency should close gaps between high-level commitments and people’s day-to-day experience. This includes stronger monitoring of Member State implementation in equality, asylum, digital safety, and justice. It also requires consistent involvement of civil society, especially groups that work with people most affected by discrimination, violence, and social exclusion. Ireland has a strong international profile in human rights and equality. The Presidency should reinforce this by aligning domestic commitments with EU and UN priorities. The National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy offers a clear national direction that corresponds closely with European policy needs. Linking these frameworks will strengthen coherence and credibility. The Presidency should also consider how Ireland’s convening role can support progress at EU level. In October 2026, Outhouse LGBTQ+ Centre with LGBT Ireland will host the ILGA-Europe Annual Meeting in Dublin. This event, supported by Government partners, will bring together more than 400 activists, experts, and human-rights defenders from 52 countries across Europe and Central Asia. Its timing during the Presidency offers a major opportunity to deepen engagement between EU institutions, Member States, and civil society. It also reinforces Ireland’s position as a trusted leader within the European equality movement. We encourage the Government to draw on this moment. The Annual Meeting can support dialogue on rights, democracy, and community safety during the Presidency. It can also highlight Ireland’s leadership in Europe and strengthen connections that support Ireland’s campaign for a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Outhouse is ready to assist with Presidency outreach and community engagement. We host thousands of people each year and can help ensure that those least heard are part of the conversation. We thank the Department for the opportunity to contribute and remain available to support this work."

This submission outlines priorities from a LGBTQI+ perspective, but our proposals for Ireland’s Presidency also contribute more broadly to delivering a stronger Social Europe, advancing commitments to build a Union of Equality, and support the priorities and strategic orientations in the EU Strategic Agenda. 1. People and Fundamental Values at the Heart of Europe By focusing on people and values, Ireland can advance the shared vision of a fair, cohesive EU, grounded in equality and human rights. It should ensure the EU’s fundamental values – respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and human rights – are central to the Council’s work. The Strategic Agenda identifies these values as the Union’s primary strength, its compass both within the EU and globally, and the foundation for a stronger, more prosperous and more democratic union for citizens. Ireland should seek to ensure legislative and policy processes across Council configurations reflect the obligations in the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, including commitments to eliminate inequalities and combat discrimination on all grounds. This requires mainstreaming equality across the Council’s agenda and reinforcing a rights-based approach in all legislation and policy. A people-centred Presidency should emphasise measures that support inclusive social standards, equal access to rights, and protections for all, including those whose rights remain unevenly protected across the EU, such as LGBTQI+ persons. The aim should be to facilitate progress on existing legislative files, support evidence-based discussions, and strengthen implementation of EU law so everyone in Europe, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics, can live safe, authentic, and dignified lives. 2. Protecting and Strengthening Europe’s Democratic Union Ireland’s Presidency will take place at a moment of heightened threats to democracy, civic space, and fundamental rights across Europe. The Strategic Agenda emphasises the need to defend democracy, safeguard the rule of law, and counter extremism. A second high-level priority should therefore focus on defending democracy and combating hate online and offline. Across Europe, LGBTQI+ communities and other marginalised groups face rising hate, violence, disinformation, and scapegoating, fuelled by extremist rhetoric and polarisation. These attacks are frequently used to undermine democratic institutions, weaken the rule of law, and restrict civil society. Protecting our communities is inseparable from protecting the integrity of Europe’s democratic systems. Ireland’s Presidency should work to strengthen legal and policy responses to hate, reinforce fundamental rights, and support resilient democratic institutions. This includes facilitating Council discussions on countering hate and discrimination, supporting digital policy to tackle online hate, and helping advance rule of law mechanisms and instruments that safeguard rights. With its strong equality and human rights record and reputation, Ireland can guide efforts to ensure the EU remains steadfast in defending democratic values and resisting the instrumentalisation of vulnerable communities. A Presidency grounded in protecting democracy and fundamental rights will contribute significantly to a resilient, credible, and unified EU."

The following focus areas will help close gaps in legal protections, and support the EU Strategic Agenda, Commission workplan, and more broadly a Union of Equality and Social Europe. Strengthening Anti-Discrimination Frameworks: prioritise closing long-standing gaps in the EU’s antidiscrimination legal framework. Current protections are uneven, limited largely to employment, and do not fully protect trans, intersex, and non-binary people, leaving significant gaps. Ireland should: o prioritise renewed efforts in Council to achieve the unanimity required to adopt the Horizontal Equal Treatment Directive (Pending Proposal 102, Ref: COM(2008)426 final 2008/0140 (CNS) 2.07.2008); o ensure concrete plans for comprehensive protection to include not only sexual orientation, but also gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics, taking into account EU case law, secondary legislation (Victims’ Rights Direct, Recast Qualification Directive, and the inclusion of these grounds in the 2024 Equality Bodies Directive (2022/0400). Tackling Hate: Rising hate speech and hate crime across Europe demand a coordinated EU response. Ireland should: o prioritise work to unblock progress on adding hate crime and hate speech to the list of Eurocrimes under Article 83(1) TFEU (Pending Proposal 100, Ref: COM(2021)777 final 9.12.2021); o facilitate Council discussions on approaches to tackling online hate including AI-facilitated discrimination and online harms, and addressing intersectional discrimination, to strengthen the EU’s capability to address emerging threats; o ensure the revised Victims’ Rights Directive reflects the specific needs of LGBTQI+ victims and marginalised groups in its implementation. Ensuring Freedom of Movement: facilitate Council work to ensure full and effective freedom of movement for all LGBTQI+ people and families. This fundamental right may be violated due to disparities between states in legal recognition of rainbow families, or the absence of or barriers to accessing legal gender recognition. Ireland should help progress legislation and guidance ensuring equal recognition across borders within the EU of family relationships, marriages, partnerships, parenthood, children’s rights, and legal gender recognition, to ensure fundamental rights and freedoms are upheld. Key priorities include: advance negotiations on the draft Regulation on mutual recognition of parenthood; o support incorporation of relevant CJEU rulings on cross-border family and gender recognition in legislation; encourage Member States to address barriers faced by rainbow families and trans and nonbinary people in cross-border situations. Migration and Asylum: We support and endorse the submission of the Coalition on the EU Migration Pact, of which we are a member. We particularly emphasise the need to protect the rights of LGBTQI+ migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in all relevant EU policy and legislation."

A Presidency grounded in fundamental rights, equality, democratic values and evidence-based policymaking will not only improve outcomes for marginalised communities, including LGBTQI+ people, but will also enhance social cohesion, economic participation, and trust in the European project more broadly. Ensure meaningful and structured engagement with civil society and affected communities: A strong and vibrant civil society is essential for a democratic, resilient and socially cohesive EU. Ireland should champion the establishment of a more formalised and inclusive mechanism for structured dialogue between civil society and the Council. It will be essential that this includes the meaningful participation of LGBTQI+ organisations in systematic engagement with the EU Council, including Council-led discussions, events, conferences, expert groups, and informal ministerial meetings. Civil society organisations, particularly those representing marginalised groups, bring essential evidence and realworld insight on barriers to rights, access to services, and implementation gaps. Ensuring sustained EU and national funding for these organisations will also safeguard their long-term contribution to EU policy development, strengthen democratic participation, and protect civic space at a time of increasing pressure. Promote people-centred, rights-based policymaking that strengthens social and economic inclusion: Policies that safeguard equality, combat discrimination and protect fundamental rights directly support stronger labour markets, healthier communities and more resilient economies. Ireland’s Presidency should help shape Council deliberations so legislative files and policy processes consistently consider the real-life impacts on those most affected, including LGBTQI+ communities. This principled approach will ensure new measures, whether in employment, digital policy, health, education, or internal market governance, lead to fairer participation, reduced inequalities, and improved outcomes for people, businesses and communities across Europe. Facilitate more effective rights protection and cross-border cooperation: A major challenge in the EU remains the uneven protection of rights and freedoms across Member States. The Presidency can add value by strengthening and coordinating the Council’s work to address and close gaps. Ireland can also promote better cross-border cooperation in areas where people and businesses encounter significant barriers, such as free movement, family recognition, access to services, digital identity systems, and tackling hate crime and violence. Improving legal certainty and reducing administrative burdens benefits not only LGBTQI+ communities but also employers, service providers and national administrations. Reinforce democratic resilience and trust in EU institutions: In a period of growing polarisation and disinformation, an inclusive Presidency that visibly centres EU values can help restore public trust. By supporting policy coherence between equality, rule of law, digital safety, and fundamental rights, the Presidency can demonstrate that protecting marginalised and minoritised groups also strengthens democracy, social stability and sustainable economic development."

To foster a genuine sense of ownership over both EU membership and the Presidency, communication must be accessible, participatory, and centred on real people’s lived experiences. It should prioritise inclusivity, transparency, and meaningful engagement, recognising that communication is not a one-way process but a continuous dialogue. Make communication participatory, not performative: Effective communication requires mechanisms that allow people, not just governments, to speak back to EU institutions. Ireland should promote diverse and innovative ways for citizens, communities and CSOs to engage directly with the Presidency. This could include interactive townhalls, community forums and dialogues; participatory digital platforms where citizens can contribute ideas; thematic engagement/consultation events co-hosted with civil society, youth groups, and regional networks; and targeted engagement with groups historically under-represented in EU decision-making, including LGBTQI+ communities. Such dialogues strengthen democratic participation and ensure policy debates reflect lived realities across the EU. Showcase Irish leadership and inclusivity: Ireland prides itself on its record of civic dialogue, community partnership and consultation. The Presidency should highlight this approach through a series of visible and welcoming “Fáilte” events – open, inclusive public events across Ireland, and perhaps in Brussels and other European locations, designed to demystify EU policymaking, celebrate European collaboration, and strengthen connections between citizens and institutions. Ireland should also use its Presidency to model a whole-of-society approach, demonstrating how inclusive engagement, including with LGBTQI+ organisations and marginalised groups, improves policymaking outcomes and broadens democratic legitimacy. Communicate EU benefits through people’s lived experiences: Messages about the benefits of EU membership resonate most strongly when they are grounded in concrete, relatable stories. Ireland can amplify narratives about how EU membership improves daily life: safer workplaces, cross-border healthcare, consumer protections, free movement, cultural exchange, equality and human rights protections, and funding opportunities for community groups and small organisations. Engaging trusted messengers, such as respected community leaders, young people, artists, activists and sectoral ambassadors, will help reach audiences who may not engage with traditional political communication. Address knowledge gaps and empower smaller or marginalised groups: Many smaller civil society organisations and community groups lack the resources or knowledge to navigate EU structures or access funding. Targeted workshops, multilingual toolkits, capacity-building sessions, and cross-border initiatives, including those involving Northern Ireland, can help demystify EU programmes and support participation from groups that rarely benefit from Presidency-level attention. Increased visibility of these opportunities during Ireland’s Presidency can build long-term awareness, especially among communities that feel distant from EU decision-making. Reinforce EU values as shared, lived principles: A strong communication strategy should foreground the fundamental EU values of for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and human rights. Demonstrating the EU’s commitment to protecting rights, especially for marginalised communities, helps build trust, solidarity and social cohesion. Ireland can model an inclusive Presidency that embodies these values not only in messaging but in its processes, partnerships and policy leadership."

Ireland Presidency comes at a pivotal moment for equality, democracy, and fundamental rights across the Union. A Presidency focused on people, rights, values, and democratic resilience is not only timely, but urgently needed. Across the EU, LGBTQI+ people are facing increasing hostility, including organised disinformation campaigns, coordinated attacks on rights, and escalating hate and violence both offline and online. These developments intersect with broader democratic backsliding, erosion of the rule of law, and shrinking civic space, with growing risks for marginalised communities and civil society organisations. At the same time, significant legislative and policy gaps remain unresolved at EU level. These include barriers to freedom of movement for LGBTQI+ people and families, insufficient protection from discrimination, and inconsistent implementation of CJEU rulings. Key commitments in previous EU equality frameworks, particularly relating to transgender and intersex people, also remain unfulfilled. Within this environment, the role of the Council is decisive. The Presidency provides Ireland with a crucial opportunity to drive forward equality, defend the rule of law, and advance fundamental rights at a moment when EU leadership is urgently required. Ireland is well-placed to lead, with a strong reputation in equality and human rights, constructive engagement, and commitment to EU values. Ireland’s recent social progress, coupled with its credibility, positions the Presidency to foster consensus and drive forward an EU agenda grounded in dignity, equality and human rights. This submission outlines high-level priorities – placing people and fundamental rights at the centre of EU policymaking, and protecting and strengthening Europe’s democratic union – alongside concrete policy and legislative actions through which Ireland’s Presidency can meaningfully strengthen the EU’s capacity to protect people, uphold democratic values and ensure equality across the Union. By advancing these, and centring meaningful civil society participation, Ireland can deliver a Presidency that strengthens the EU, protects its people, and leaves a lasting legacy for equality and democracy. Speaking at the Marriage Referendum +10 Conference on 13th May, the Tánaiste and then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Harris, highlighted the Presidency as a key opportunity to build on the EU LGBTIQ+ Equality Strategy, affirming that Ireland “will work closely with EU institutions and Member States to combat inequalities experienced by LGBTQI+ people, and promote respect for equality as one of the Union’s fundamental values.” This commitment should guide the Presidency’s approach. Ireland’s Presidency provides a crucial opportunity to lead with clarity, ambition and conviction at a time when EU values are being tested A Presidency that advances stalled equality legislation, responds to rising hate and disinformation, protects civic space, and embeds inclusion and equality across all policy and legislative areas will leave a lasting legacy: a more resilient, cohesive and genuinely inclusive European Union. LGBT Ireland urges the Government to adopt these priorities as part of a Presidency that strengthens Europe not only institutionally, but in the everyday lives and experiences of the people the EU exists to serve."

IPHA also recognises that resilience, both economic, societal and supply-chain, has become an increasingly unifying concept across Member State discussions and could serve as an effective organising principle for the Presidency. Within this context, IPHA recommends that Ireland adopt “Competitiveness for Equity” as its overarching theme. This framing allows the Presidency to connect improved patient outcomes with Europe’s long-term competitiveness, supply security and capacity to innovate. A central theme should be strategic resilience – which should be understood as the ability of EU systems to absorb shocks and ensure continuity across essential sectors. This includes medicines and vaccines supply, digital infrastructure, logistics, critical materials, energy systems and public trust. The theme could be supported by an associated event bringing together European stakeholders across multiple sectors to examine resilience from a whole-of-society perspective, while still aligning closely with health priorities. Aligned with this cross-cutting approach, the Presidency should continue advancing Ireland’s strong health agenda, focusing on faster and fairer access to innovation. This includes recommitting to predictable timelines under the Transparency Directive and embedding patient involvement in HTA and regulatory decision-making. This should include improved access to orphan medicines with a streamlined reimbursement process. Health resilience should also be advanced through life-course immunisation, supporting vaccination against influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal disease and RSV. Strong immunisation strategies support population health, reduce system pressures and contribute to AMR mitigation. Ireland should also elevate brain health and neurological conditions as a strategic lens for dementia and healthy ageing, supporting the European Partnership for Brain Health and an EU Coordination Plan for the Brain. This aligns with demographic trends and positions Europe as a leader in brain research and innovation. Finally, digital health and data interoperability should be a Presidency priority. Secure, interoperable health data systems and AI-enabled care pathways can accelerate diagnosis, improve efficiency and support Europe’s leadership in digital transformation."

This is expected to include proposals in biotech, medical products, preparedness, data, and broader competitiveness and resilience frameworks. Within this legislative landscape, the EU Biotech Act should serve as a flagship priority. Ireland can help ensure the Act operates as a simplification instrument, enhancing IP protections, streamlining approvals and modernising ethical review processes – rather than creating new barriers. A competitive and globally attractive biotech ecosystem is essential for Europe’s scientific and industrial strength. The EU Critical Medicines Act should also be shaped around patient outcomes and genuine supply resilience. Key elements include real-time shortage alerts, accelerated permitting for new capacity, diversified manufacturing locations and risk-based assessments. Ireland’s existing manufacturing strengths offer practical models for implementation. IPHA recommends that disease-focused initiatives, such as the EU Beating Cancer Plan, cardiovascular health strategies, rare-disease action plan and harmonised newborn screening remain priorities. These initiatives strengthen integrated care pathways, support early intervention, improve survival and enhance Europe’s research base. Ireland should further prioritise digital health legislation, including interoperable datasets, trusted AI deployment, and robust IP and data-governance frameworks. These will accelerate evidence generation, improve care coordination and strengthen innovation ecosystems across Europe. Alongside the formal legislative agenda, Ireland could support an associated strategic-resilience event with a wide multi-sectoral scope. Such an event could examine interdependencies across pharmaceuticals, digital systems, logistics, energy, transport and others – providing a complementary platform to the formal Council work programme."

A Presidency narrative anchored in resilience, competitiveness and equity will help citizens see the tangible value of EU cooperation. A core impact will come from actions that reduce time-to-treatment gaps and support predictable, efficient regulatory pathways. Embedding patient voices in HTA and regulatory processes ensures that innovation reaches people who need it most. Strengthening life-course immunisation will deliver major benefits—protecting citizens, reducing avoidable hospitalisations, preserving workforce productivity and supporting AMR strategies. Digital advances, including interoperable patient records and AI-enabled care pathways, will drive efficiency, empower patients and open new opportunities for SMEs and innovators. Ireland can highlight replicable digital models, enabling smaller Member States to accelerate transformation. Progress on disease-focused initiatives such as cancer, cardiovascular health, rare diseases and brain health will drive earlier diagnosis, reduce health inequalities and support innovation ecosystems across Europe. IPHA are willing to collaborate with Patient Advocacy Groups on events and position papers to achieve these aims and ensure the voice of the patient is heard throughout the Presidency. Ireland has a unique opportunity to demonstrate the regional impact of the life sciences sector, showcasing how EU policy supports jobs, training and research capacity in communities beyond major cities. Regional site visits during the Presidency can highlight Ireland’s distributed ecosystem and reinforce the connection between EU policy and local prosperity. An associated event on cross-sectoral strategic resilience would further highlight how coordinated European action strengthens supply security, digital reliability and societal preparedness practical benefits citizens can understand and value. We believe that Ireland is uniquely placed to spearhead a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce bringing together the European Commission, Member States, and industry – as referenced in the submission to this consultation by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Association (EFPIA). IPHA supports the establishment of this Taskforce, which should deliver a bold, high-level Political Declaration during the Irish Presidency, reaffirming the strategic importance of Europe’s research-based pharmaceutical sector and the EU’s commitment to invest in its future."

Ireland should therefore adopt a clear narrative: “Better Health, Stronger Europe.” This connects EU cooperation with visible improvements in care, access, security and competitiveness. Regional engagement will be essential. Therefore, IPHA proposes that the government considers site visits to pharmaceutical and life-science facilities, particularly in rural and regional areas, which will demonstrate how EU membership supports investment, employment and innovation across the country. Ireland should also facilitate citizen and patient-centred dialogues, including patient roundtables that highlight lived experiences and bring policymaking closer to the public. Digital storytelling can showcase practical examples such as improved vaccination coverage, earlier cancer diagnosis, AI-driven clinical decision support and secure medicine supply chains, helping people see how EU cooperation directly benefits their families and communities. Communicating the Presidency’s work on strategic resilience will also help citizens understand how the EU safeguards critical supply systems, digital infrastructure and societal stability. An associated event grounded in resilience would offer a strong communications anchor for explaining the relevance of EU action.

The 2026 EU Presidency offers a platform to lead on competitiveness, equity, and innovation—but this requires a clear national framework. Publishing a National Life Sciences Strategy ahead of the Presidency will give Ireland the credibility and capability to influence EU priorities and showcase best practice. As stated, the Presidency should adopt “Competitiveness for Equity” as its guiding theme, ensuring innovation translates into faster and fairer patient outcomes. We believe a National Life Sciences Strategy will assist Ireland to lead on major EU initiatives such as the Critical Medicines Act and Biotech Act, shaping policies on supply resilience, regulatory simplification, and investment conditions. By aligning these priorities with Ireland’s integrated life sciences ecosystem, the Presidency can demonstrate practical models for resilient supply chains and patient-friendly research. Ireland can also champion disease-focused agendas like the EU Beating Cancer Plan, cardiovascular health, rare disease and brain health, while promoting life-course immunisation to strengthen health security and economic stability. A National Life Sciences Strategy will allow Ireland to showcase how linking integrated care pathways with equity targets improves outcomes while creating high-value employment. By aligning with the European Health Data Space and embedding AI into care delivery, Ireland can demonstrate replicable models for smaller and larger health systems. A national strategy will provide the blueprint for Ireland to publish governance playbooks and demonstrate replicable digital health models, reinforcing Europe’s leadership in innovation. IPHA believes that a National Life Sciences Strategy should be built upon three strategic pillars: Fostering Enterprise: Grow indigenous companies, sustain FDI, and protect advanced manufacturing. Innovation Uptake: Accelerate access to medicines, diagnostics, and digital tools; reform procurement; expand clinical trials. Research, Data & Digital: Position Ireland as a global hub for life sciences research and digital health adoption. Cross-cutting enablers—such as a Life Sciences Council, skills pipeline development, and regulatory reform—will underpin the success of a Strategy. A National Life Sciences Strategy will also be the basis for a compelling Presidency narrative: “Better Health, Stronger Europe.” Publishing a National Life Sciences Strategy ahead of the Presidency is not optional—it is essential. It will give Ireland the credibility, clarity, and capability to lead on competitiveness, equity, and innovation, ensuring that the 2026 Presidency delivers lasting impact for patients, businesses, and communities across Europe. Such a Strategy would also provide the policy foundation for an associated strategic-resilience event, enabling Ireland to showcase leadership across interconnected sectors while remaining firmly anchored in the health agenda."

It is crucial that operations from/to Island national automatically fall within the scope of the Directive. Roadworthiness Package: It is an opportunity to: i. Securing measures (article 10 and 13) in a revision of the CPC Directive (see more details below) while also accommodating more relevant and certified in house training modules in lieu of the current state based irrelevant material, all in the pursuit of “Vision Zero”. ii. Allow for a 12-month validity of the roadworthiness certificate which can be suspended by the vehicle taken off the road. iii. Emphasise the importance of emission testing frequency and intervals for N1 vehicles, along with the significant increase in items subject to testing, reference to the fact that any enhanced emission testing should to hand in hand with fuel quality standards oversight, especially in Ireland where NO state or 3rd Party oversight is in place. c. Energy taxation Directive: Progress is still uncertain on this file which requires a unanimous support among member states. The bottom line for the IRHA is that Member States keep the possibility to grant a rebate of the excise applied to any biofuels. This is also an opportunity to cap poor fuel quality with mandated standardised oversight, thereby ensuring the correct application of the multiple fuel taxes/levies on the final fuel mix, while protecting the supply chain. Directive on Weights and dimensions of trucks: possibly conclude the trilogues in case the Danish Presidency manages to strike a deal among Member States. Ultimately, it should be avoided to take decision that will lead to a reduction of load capacity and to more vehicles on the road. EU budget for transport: i. The Connecting Europe Facility regulation should be built in a way that makes it easier for safe parking projects to get co-funding. ii. Creating a dedicated EU vocational training fund to support the training, retraining and upskilling of professional drivers in EU Member States. Upcoming proposals: The proposal on Clean Corporate Vehicles is expected shortly. It should NOT mandate the purchase of ZEV. The market should decide when enabling conditions are in place. It is typically an opportunity to alleviate the regulatory and environmental burden on SMEs. Encourage the Commission to come up with a Proposal to revise CO2 emissions from trucks in line with its upcoming proposal on CO2 from cars. Keep in mind that HDVs emissions are a lot harder to abate than those of cars. Revise the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK to ease the various paperwork and controls (for instance SPS). Importantly, pressure should be exercised so that British Rules on stowaways become fairer for drivers and road haulage operators who usually must face a double penalty: migrants breaking into their trucks and they still must pay hefty fines. The IRHA is hopeful that the Commission can come up with a proposal to revise the Driver Training Directive. It should be adapted to reflect evolving sector needs and to improve the attractiveness of the profession. It would an opportunity among others to: i. Enable EU Member States to introduce a dedicated 7-hour periodic CPC training (instead of currently 35) for experienced and safe professional drivers who have carried out at least four cycles of five-year periodic training with the validity of their CPC extended for five more years, following the completion of the 7-hour CPC training. ii. Make proof of clean infringements and safety records, validated by national authorities, as a precondition for experienced professional drivers to benefit from their exemption. iii. Introduce a dedicated initial seven-hour return-to-driving CPC course, with an enhanced practical driving element, for experienced drives who have temporarily left the profession and whose CPC has expired (they must take the remaining 28 hours within one calendar year following the completion of the seven-hour initial course). iv. Remove the mandated use of “Closed Box Body” for training as it disadvantages many hauliers who are not using this specific type of trailers, as they cannot train drivers in the real-world conditions of their operation. This is tenet of the revised Driving Licence Directive, recently approved by the European Parliament. We should also anticipate the Commission Communication on islands and coastal communities (non-legislative, Q2 2026). It appears on Page4 in the 2026 Commission Work Plan. Ireland will obviously be able to make a plea for a level playing field between economic operators from Island Nations and those of continental Europe.

In the EU there are about 229 million women (51% of the population). And given the EU’s median age is ~44.7 years, many women are in or approaching the typical menopause age of 45 for perimenopause and 51 for menopause. By 2030 globally some 500 million women will be in the 45–55 age bracket (the menopause stage. In Ireland (population ~5.2M), about 652,000 women are aged 45–65 (peri/postmenopause); roughly 420,000 of those are in paid employment. In short, millions of European women – a significant share of the workforce – are peri- or post-menopausal. These aren't just statistics—they're your colleagues, your managers, your mother, your sister, your partner, your best friend, and quite possibly, you. Women you know and care about are navigating menopause right now, yet most are doing it in silence, without the support that could transform their experience. Findings from our 2025 Perimenopause and Menopause survey of 2,555 Irish women found: 98% experience symptoms and there are 40+ symptoms 34% classify their symptoms as severe 66% felt unprepared for menopause 57% say menopause remains taboo 95% support free access to HRT International data confirm that menopause stigma is not unique to Ireland. Astellas’ global Menopause Experience and Attitudes Study (MEAS), conducted across six countries, found that only 25% of respondents believe menopause is portrayed positively in society, and among women with lived experience this falls to 19%. Furthermore, 66% believe menopause is not taken seriously, rising to 75% for those who have experienced it. OUR JOURNEY: MAKING MENOPAUSE MAINSTREAM IN IRELAND Conduct market research to capture Irish women’s experience of menopause, both personally and professionally. Open Ireland’s first dedicated menopause clinic, The Menopause Hub, in 2018 – evidence-based, aligned with British Menopause Society guidance, and multidisciplinary, with medical doctors, psychologist, pelvic physiotherapist, dietitian and nutritionist, all specialising in menopause. Educate women through talks, webinars, conferences, media and community outreach. Engage stakeholders – media, government, Department of Health, medical professional bodies, universities– to put menopause on the public agenda. Lead advocacy and campaigning for free HRT, working with representatives and policymakers. Develop workplace education, training, policy templates and accreditation, helping employers become genuinely menopause-inclusive. IRELAND'S GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN TO RESPOND: A national public awareness campaign on menopause. Civil Service Menopause in the Workplace Policy Framework in consultation with The Menopause Hub Complex care clinics for menopause in the public maternity hospitals. Free HRT from 2025. Back in 2019 [REDACTED UNDER GDPR ]made a detailed submission to the Department of Health on menopause as a neglected area of women's health. Since then, she has framed the national approach as the ""3As"": Awareness – honest, accessible information and public awareness campaign, Accessibility – equal access to high quality, trained, healthcare professionals for all (irrespective of sociodemographic group or geography - rich vs poor, rural vs urban) Affordability – including free care and free HRT In just a few years, this journey has helped move menopause from hidden and taboo to mainstream in Ireland. The model works because it addresses menopause holistically—not just as a medical issue, but as a workplace, social, and economic challenge that affects millions. What started in one clinic has sparked national policy change. The approach has been tested, refined, and proven effective in shifting cultural attitudes, clinical practice, and government priorities. It's scalable, adaptable to different healthcare systems, and grounded in evidence that transcends borders. The Irish Presidency in 2026 is a chance for Europe to learn from that journey: to treat peri/menopause as a core test of how seriously we take women's health, equality and economic participation across the EU. The framework is ready. The evidence is clear. Now is the time to take Ireland's success story and make it Europe's."
129,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c622c935/The_Menopause_Hub_Menopause_Hub_Academy_-_Submission_129.docx,"The Menopause Hub, Menopause Hub Academy",,,,2,"We suggest that Ireland’s Presidency uses peri/menopause as a practical, concrete focus and aims for three simple, powerful outcomes that other countries can adapt. 1. A SHARED EUROPEAN STANDARD FOR MENOPAUSE CARE No woman’s experience of peri/menopause should depend on where she lives or how much she earns. Building on Ireland’s experience, the Presidency could: Encourage Member States to develop or strengthen national women’s health strategies that explicitly include peri/menopause. Promote minimum expectations for menopause care: menopause trained primary-care providers, clear referral pathways, multidisciplinary support where needed, and a full range of treatment options, including HRT. Highlight the value of specialist clinics and complex care pathways, similar to those that Ireland has rolled out, for women with more complex needs. THE 3AS AS A SIMPLE EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK [REDACTED UNDER GDPR] 3As offer a practical template that can be understood and applied anywhere: Awareness – public campaigns that normalise peri/menopause, explain symptoms and options, and reassure women they are not alone or “going mad”. Accessibility –to equal quality menopause care, reducing inequalities between rich and poor, rural and urban, and between Member States. Affordability – tackling cost barriers, including access to free or affordable HRT and related care. Ireland can share how this framing has guided its own progress and invite other countries to adapt it. A FREE MID-LIFE HEALTH CHECK FOR WOMEN 40+ ACROSS EUROPE While women live longer than men, they live more years in poorer health. This gender health paradox is driven in part by post-menopause diseases: Cardiovascular disease – the number one killer of women globally and in Europe, but still underrecognised. Bone disease – osteoporosis and osteopenia; around 50% of women will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime, including free DEXA scans. Cognitive disease – dementia and Alzheimer’s. We recommend that the Irish Presidency champion the idea of a free Mid-Life Health Check for all women 40+, with peri/menopause as a central component. The planned inclusion of menopause in the UK’s NHS free health checks from 2026 shows that this is realistic and achievable. Such a check would identify risks early, provide tailored advice, and connect women to appropriate treatment and support, saving lives and reducing long-term costs. MENOPAUSE IN THE WORKPLACE Peri/menopause is also a workforce issue .It is an economic issue, hiding in plain sight, that impacts employers, women and the gender pay-gap. Irish data from 2,555 women show: 32% have stepped back from promotions due to their symptoms 36% have considered leaving work 8% have left work due to symptoms 83% believe menopause education should be mandatory in workplaces 65% want menopause awareness training for all staff (only 23% currently have access) 75% want menopause-specific training for managers and HR (only 17% have access) 72% want a dedicated workplace menopause policy (only 18% report having one) 84% want access to menopause specialists through their workplace (just 8% currently do) 81% believe workplaces should be accredited by an external body for menopause support (with 34% saying this is extremely important) Across Europe, emerging evidence points to major productivity and employment losses among women in midlife. Emerging economic analyses also show that menopause is a macroeconomic issue. In Germany, menopause- related productivity loss is estimated to cost €9.4 billion per year, largely due to reduced working hours and women leaving their jobs. The Presidency should highlight Ireland’s model of workplace education, training, policy and accreditation, and encourage Member States and employers to adopt menopause-inclusive practices so that women do not have to choose between their health and their careers."
129,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c622c935/The_Menopause_Hub_Menopause_Hub_Academy_-_Submission_129.docx,"The Menopause Hub, Menopause Hub Academy",,,,3,"Focusing on peri/menopause is one of the most effective ways for the Irish Presidency to deliver visible, positive impact for people, businesses and communities across the EU. FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES When peri/menopause is recognised and well managed: women sleep better, think more clearly, and feel emotionally steadier anxiety, low mood and ""brain fog"" reduce relationships at home improve, because partners and families understand what is happening women feel like themselves again We see this every day at The Menopause Hub. Women come back after appropriate treatment and support and say they ""finally feel back to their old self"". They tell us they've reclaimed their confidence, their relationships, and their sense of who they are. These transformations aren't outliers—they're the norm when women receive informed, compassionate care. The ripple effect on children, partners and wider family is enormous. FOR BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMY Peri/menopause typically occurs when women are at the height of their skills and experience, often combining senior roles with caring for children, older relatives or both. A 2024 World Economic Forum report estimates that closing the women’s health gap could unlock $1 trillion in global GDP by 2040, demonstrating the enormous economic value of improving midlife women’s health and care pathways. Our Irish survey found that: over a third of women considered leaving work one in ten actually quit work nearly a third turned down promotion due to their symptoms The challenge is cultural as well as clinical. Across the countries surveyed by Astellas’ MEAS, 36% of respondents reported negative workplace impacts due to menopause, including reduced productivity (17%) and fear of telling colleagues (14%). Over 57% believe women are not well supported at work. These patterns represent a quiet leak of talent, leadership and experience from the labour market, with real consequences for productivity, innovation and competitiveness. Similar trends are now being documented in other European countries. Europe cannot afford to lose this expertise simply because workplaces fail to accommodate a natural life transition. In the UK, the Employment Rights Bill is driving change by pushing employers to take menopause support seriously, with larger organisations (250+) required to publish menopause action plans. It marks a shift toward stronger protections, clearer policies, and a more open, supportive culture for those experiencing menopause at work. By promoting menopause-inclusive workplaces – with awareness training, simple adjustments, supportive policies and access to expert advice – the Council's work can: keep more experienced women in work reduce absenteeism and presenteeism lower recruitment and training costs support diversity in leadership improve the gender pay-gap FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS AND PUBLIC FINANCES Investing in peri/menopause support is also smart preventative healthcare. By addressing symptoms and risks in midlife, we can reduce the later burden of: heart disease and stroke fractures and disability from osteoporosis cognitive decline and dementia A midlife health check for women, integrated with better menopause care, will pay dividends in reduced hospitalisations, social care needs and lost productivity. Every euro invested in midlife women's health returns multiples in avoided crisis care and sustained workforce participation. FOR TRUST IN INSTITUTIONS Finally, there is an issue of trust and visibility. Many women feel that their midlife health needs are invisible to policymakers. When the EU demonstrates that it takes peri/menopause seriously – by talking about it openly and supporting practical action – it sends a powerful signal that women's experiences matter. This isn't just about health policy—it's about whether the EU truly represents all its citizens, at every life stage. Ireland's Presidency can show what it looks like when Europe truly listens to women in midlife and acts on what it hears."

This is a life stage that every woman will experience, yet many still face it alone, uninformed and unsupported. By elevating peri/menopause, the Presidency can show that EU values such as equality, dignity, fairness, wellbeing and economic participation are not abstract ideals but lived commitments. START WITH STORIES, NOT SLOGANS Women do not experience “policy programmes”; they experience real symptoms in real moments of strain: hot flushes at 3am before a major workplace presentation or meeting brain fog in a team meeting anxiety on the school run joint pain that makes physical work painful insomnia that erodes productivity and confidence Bringing these everyday experiences into the political narrative humanises the issue and shows why EU-level action matters. The Presidency could: share stories of women whose lives improved because they finally received evidence-based menopause care or workplace support highlight how cooperation, shared learning and political will made those improvements possible clearly show: “Because of Ireland’s Presidency and EU cooperation, this is what changed for women like me.” This makes the EU’s work tangible, personal and relatable. USE TRUSTED VOICES Public trust grows when the message comes from people women believe, not from institutions alone. The most credible advocates are those who speak from lived experience and professional expertise. Messages should be carried by: women who have navigated peri/menopause clinicians and menopause specialists community organisations, patient groups and NGOs employers who have implemented menopause-inclusive policies Ireland already has these voices—women and professionals who have participated in media, policy consultations and workplace programmes. Amplifying them at EU level deepens legitimacy and builds cross-country solidarity. MAKE THE LINK BETWEEN DECISIONS AND DAILY LIFE For many people, EU policy feels distant. Peri/menopause can help close that gap. When the EU supports: better menopause training for healthcare professionals midlife-health checks public awareness campaigns workplace guidelines and accreditation communications should spell out, in simple, personal terms: “This is why your GP now understands menopause better.” “This is why you’re seeing menopause information in your workplace.” “This is why your HRT is easier to access and afford.” “This is why it’s now normal—not taboo—to talk about menopause.” This makes the benefits of EU action visible and concrete. CREATE SPACE FOR WOMEN TO SPEAK Ownership and trust grow when people feel heard. Too often, women’s health concerns—especially around menopause—have been silenced or minimised. This is also a democratic issue. Women hold just 33% of seats in national parliaments across the EU, meaning that policies affecting women’s midlife health are often shaped without proportional representation. The Presidency could: host online and in-person listening sessions on peri/menopause and midlife health invite written stories or short testimonies from women across Member States ensure these inputs are summarised, published and fed back into policy discussions This “listening and responding” approach shows respect, transparency and democratic participation in action. Talking openly about peri/menopause—and linking it directly to EU decision-making—would make the benefits of EU membership real for millions of women and their families. It would show that Europe is willing to take seriously the health, dignity, equality and economic participation of half its population. This is not just a women’s issue; it is a societal opportunity to demonstrate leadership, compassion and the practical value of European cooperation."

Given the troubling trends around shrinking civic space in EU institutions and some Member States, urgent action is required to safeguard civil society. Rule of Law/Protecting values: It is urgent that the EU reasserts its binding values in all areas of policymaking. EU values have increasingly been subordinated to other goals. The EU’s failure to take serious measures to halt or respond to the genocide in Gaza has also called into question its moral and legal authority, undermining its reputation citizens in the EU and in the Global South. With the growth of the far-right presence and influence in EU policymaking and the normalisation of many of their policy goals and rhetoric (e.g. on migration, environment), it is urgent that the EU, likeminded MS and MEPs reassert fundamental values and democratic norms in all areas of policy-making and practice. Harsher penalties need to be imposed internally on MS who breach Rule of Law standards and EU law. More broadly, the US threat to the UN, the ICC and other multilateral bodies require an EU that unequivocally and consistently upholds international law and protects multilateral bodies and uses the tools at its disposal to do so (e.g. EU Blocking Statute). Human rights safeguards are increasingly absent in the EU’s response to migration, Ireland can use the Presidency to assert more humane policymaking that adheres to refugee and international human rights law. Competitiveness with sustainability and citizens at the centre: Reclaiming the Green Deal as a cornerstone of the EU’s economic growth, competitiveness, security and social cohesion. A competitive Europe is also a sustainable one and it requires credible policies and a long-term vision, rather than a limited focus on short-term gains. The race to deregulate without sufficient risk and impact assessments, is only causing greater regulatory instability. Many companies are in favour of climate transition plans, sustainability reporting and due diligence and see them as a key foundation to achieve the EU’s economic and sustainability objectives. The legality of the accelerated deregulation processes being facilitated under the Omnibus I is being assessed by the European Ombudsman and is being challenged before the European Court of Justice. Moreover, the EU must ensure that simplification is not prioritized over its citizens who are supportive of environmental protection and climate change mitigation, and have the right to a sustainable and just future."

As the EU faces a decline in trust in democratic institutions and growing challenges of cost of living and housing, the Irish government should use the Presidency to also promote the safeguarding of funding for CSOs who work to protect the Rule of Law, the environment, social cohesion and democratic resilience and support the most marginalised in society. The proposed increase of CERV+ funding under the AgoraEU instrument is welcomed, however, it is crucial that the advocacy work of CSO networks is recognised as a legitimate and fundamental democratic activity, and continues to be supported. Faced with the closure of USAID and declining ODA from several EU Member States, it is urgent that ambitious funding in the Global Europe instrument for ODA is maintained throughout MFF negotiations. Moreover, ODA should focus on sustainable development and not be conditioned to further migration policy and economic interests. It must be human rights compliant and adhere to the SDGs, humanitarian and development standards and human rights. With efforts to delegitimise CSOs within the European Parliament, and shrinking civic space across several MS, Ireland should lead on calling for CSOs to be protected and enabled to participate in the MFF negotiations and policymaking more broadly at EU level. Values based Foreign Policy: The EU’s vision for the Middle East in the Commission’s 2026 workplan, with a narrow focus on humanitarian aid in Gaza and the reform of the Palestinian Authority, is far from sufficient. Despite the ceasefire, Palestinians continue to be killed on a daily basis and Israeli authorities continue to block most humanitarian assistance into Gaza. The EU cannot normalise genocide. Ireland should use the Presidency and the chair of the FAC, to call for an EU response that focuses on the urgent protection of civilians and meaningful pressure on Israel to halt its violations of international law and ensure accountability. The Irish government should maintain its position calling for the enforcement of the existing conditionality clauses in the EU-Israel Association Agreement, given that Israel has consistently breached them, as confirmed by the EU’s own assessment. Failing the suspension of the AA, Ireland should seek coordinated action from likeminded states to restore the EU’s credibility and its adherence to international law obligations. Similarly, Ireland should promote a long-term two state solution rooted in self-determination, justice and accountability; factors completely absent from the current US-sponsored peace plan. Ireland should maintain support for Ukraine and call for greater economic pressure on Russia to end its war of aggression and sufficient economic, political and military support from the EU for Ukraine. Ukraine must be front and centre of any ceasefire negotiations. Building on its 2004 legacy, Ireland should drive momentum regarding Ukraine’s accession bid as well as accelerating accession processes for Moldova and other Western Balkans states. If the proposed Digital Omnibus is still under negotiation in the second half of 2026, propose that negotiations cannot proceed unless adequate fundamental rights impact assessments have been conducted, nor without meaningful participation of civil society."

It is urgent that the Council, via MS’s ministers, and in its relations with the Parliament, reposition citizens at the centre of EU in policy and practice. The Commission’s twin priority pillars of security and defence and competitiveness will have limited benefit for EU citizens, if they are not underpinned by efforts to strengthen democratic governance, human rights and rule of law, as well as environmental protection, sustainability and social protection. Citizens will only feel heard if they and the groups that represent them are given meaningful access to decision-making processes and their proposals respected and heard. For this reason, the formalisation of interinstitutional dialogue with civil society is urgent. Moreover, Ireland could instigate a European Citizens Panel, or similar initiative, during its Presidency to inform Ireland’s engagement with the EU in the coming years. This would be of great value to Ireland, its EU counterparts, and also reinforce Ireland’s role as MS that promotes civil society engagement. European Movement Ireland has significant experience in such processes, having played a leading role in the Conference of Europe, would be happy to support any such initiatives."

In our 2025 poll, less than half of respondents believed the EU is moving in the right direction, and only a third believed they are represented at EU level. For this reason, a Presidency rooted in participatory democracy and citizen engagement is important. A Presidency that demonstrates EU values in action would also inspire citizens to be engaged. The Presidency needs to also be able to articulate issues that concern citizens in their daily lives e.g. cost of living, housing, employment etc. Even if specific files relating to these issues (and with the caveat that housing isn’t an EU competency, but the EU is assuming more of a role) are not on the table in the second half of 2026, it is important that communication on the Presidency includes messaging on what the EU does, or plans to do, on some of the issues that most concern EU citizens."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
119,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/39061bc6/Individual_submission_-_Submission_119.docx,,Individual,Retired,Small town urban,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
119,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/39061bc6/Individual_submission_-_Submission_119.docx,,Individual,Retired,Small town urban,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri-investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry-specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

At a time of intense global competition, Ireland should lead a solutions-driven agenda that prioritises competitiveness and regulatory simplification—cutting unnecessary complexity, fostering innovation, and enabling businesses to scale across the Single Market. Under the theme ‘Delivering a competitive, secure and future-ready Europe,’ Ireland can drive coherence, consistency, and long-term resilience, ensuring Europe remains agile, prosperous, and globally influential."" The following themes should form the key focus of Ireland’s Presidency: • Competitiveness and Single Market renewal: Strengthening the integrity of the Single Market and helping member States to fully realise its benefits by advancing EU plans for a Savings and Investment Union and a Capital Markets Union, enabling SME and scale-up finance. Access to finance remains a challenge for business - Ireland can help to reduce barriers to crossborder investment, deepen capital markets, and facilitate greater access to finance for European households and businesses, ensuring we remain at the forefront of financial integration and innovation in the EU. Financial literacy and retail investment are critical enablers of market development. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise initiatives that improve public understanding of investment opportunities and expand domestic participation in capital markets. Removing EU market fragmentation, ensuring greater regulatory consistency and tackling barriers to cross-border service provision by advancing the 28th Regime will be a central priority under Commissioner McGrath in 2026. Finally, concluding any findings arising from the upcoming consultation on strengthening the coherence of audit supervision must be a key priority. Digital regulation coherence and innovation leadership: Member States are increasingly calling for streamlining of the EU’s digital (including AI) framework. Ireland’s Presidency is an opportunity to lead negotiations on the digital simplification package to produce a predictable, harmonised, digital rule book. Under Ireland’s Presidency, the EU can carve out a competitive advantage, driving coherent, practical implementation, championing ethical AI and supporting SMEs and start-ups with clearer pathways to compliance. By embedding AI into regulatory frameworks and supporting firms to adopt these technologies, the EU can position itself as a jurisdiction that embraces innovation responsibly. Our research among our 40,000 members shows that the biggest barrier to AI adoption is insufficient skills and training; over 90% are likely to participate in AI training if offered the opportunity. Promoting the role of finance professionals in ensuring the ethical use of AI and trust in digital technologies will be key to helping EU businesses to realise potential and ensure compliance. Chartered Accountants Ireland highlights the need to champion digital skills and workforce development during Ireland’s Presidency, by promoting EU-wide initiatives to close the digital skills gap, leveraging Ireland’s experience in tech education and partnerships with industry. Competitive, secure, and just green transition: Ensuring a secure and reliable supply of energy, maintaining Europe’s commitment to sustainability and remaining competitive are not mutually exclusive. Ireland has an opportunity to advance EU objectives and champion the competitive advantages to be gained with having strong values, secure energy supply, and a greener economy."

Ireland should champion the role of high-quality corporate reporting, auditing and internal control as key enablers of the SIU and CMU, including better data comparability for investors and regulators/supervisors, as drivers of trust and market integrity. Audit supervision, corporate reporting and assurance: Ireland should broker agreement on an audit supervision model that strengthens independence, consistency and oversight of audit quality across the EU. Ireland should champion the role of audit and assurance in underpinning trust in the SIU and CMU by ensuring that audited information (financial and non-financial), remains reliable and useful for decision-making. Sustainability reporting, sustainable finance and sustainability governance: The EU Sustainability Omnibus is likely to be concluded, providing Ireland with the opportunity to shift the agenda from rulemaking to supporting coherent implementation that results in clear, high-quality information for companies and investors. Ireland should lead on further developing EU-wide support for initiatives that drive the green transition and enable businesses to focus on addressing sustainability topics within operations. Digital and AI Rulebook: Ireland has an opportunity to lead on the EU’s digital simplification package and negotiate proposals arising from the EU’s Digital Omnibus. We should focus on: Driving a risk-based, evidence-driven simplification of digital obligations for businesses. Promoting the development of guidance and tools that enable businesses to apply AI and automation ethically and responsibly, leveraging Ireland’s experience in digital transformation and ethical AI. Developing supports to ensure interoperable, SME friendly e-invoicing and digital reporting, as well as supporting SMEs with cybersecurity. Omnibus on Taxation The Commission is working on a recast of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) and an evaluation of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD). The Commission is also considering how the Minimum Taxation Directive (Pillar Two) will interact with other rules. The Omnibus on Taxation is a key policy area where Ireland can drive the simplification agenda and ensure the administrative burden on business is reduced significantly. The DAC aims to achieve a broad suite of rules to enable information sharing to reduce the risks arising from aggressive tax planning and tax evasion. We recommend consideration is given in 2026 to streamlining the DAC in general and ensuring it is targeted appropriately. The ATAD provisions are now fully implemented across the EU. We recommend discussion is focused on how harmonised the implementation of ATAD is across Member States. In terms of Pillar Two, the EU needs to carefully monitor international developments and be ready to adapt quickly. There is an obvious concern for EU competitiveness in a globalised economy. The key concern is that if the US withdraws from the agreement without reaching a compromise agreement, there needs to be important discussions on the status of Pillar Two within the EU. This will remain a key issue through 2026."

As a small, open economy with an engaged population and deep experience in financial governance, digital transformation and consensus-building, Ireland is well placed to drive progress in the following ways: Build a more competitive, integrated and innovative Single Market: A more coherent Single Market, supported by initiatives such as the 28th Regime, capital markets integration and the Savings & Investment Union, would make it easier for SMEs and entrepreneurs to scale, create jobs and access finance across borders. By reducing fragmentation and simplifying company and investment rules, the Presidency can help unlock new sources of capital for people and businesses, support entrepreneurship and local job creation, and reduce administrative and financial barriers faced by SMEs. Strengthen trust and transparency in markets and institutions: High-quality, reliable financial and sustainability information underpins confidence in the EU’s economy. By advancing reforms in audit supervision, corporate reporting, sustainability assurance and digital integrity, the Presidency can ensure that investors, citizens and businesses can rely on the information they use to make decisions. This strengthens public confidence in savings and pensions, investors’ willingness to back European companies, and public trust in the EU’s governance and the fairness of markets. Reduce regulatory burden while improving outcomes through simplification: Businesses, especially SMEs, consistently identify regulatory duplication, inconsistent reporting and fragmented requirements as obstacles to growth. Ireland can drive a risk-based, evidenceinformed simplification agenda, focusing on reducing duplicative reporting across digital, tax, sustainability and financial rules, improving interoperability of digital systems (including einvoicing), promoting simpler, more proportionate rules for SMEs, and delivering clearer guidance and tools for compliance. This leads to lower costs, faster innovation adoption, and more time for businesses to focus on value creation, directly benefiting local communities. Promote consensus, stability and constructive dialogue across the EU: Ireland’s strong reputation and ability to build trust and bridge diverse positions (demonstrated in EU negotiations on Brexit) is an asset at a time of geopolitical tension and political fragmentation. By facilitating balanced, pragmatic and future-focused compromises, the Presidency can maintain legislative momentum, reduce polarisation, reinforce the EU’s collective capacity to act, and, importantly, provide certainty to markets, communities and citizens.

Promoting harmonized newborn screening (NBS) guidelines: By encouraging the development and implementation of EU-wide standards, the Presidency can help ensure that all children, regardless of country, benefit from early and accurate diagnosis. Streamlining ethics reviews for orphan clinical trials: Coordinating efforts to simplify and align ethics review processes across the EU will accelerate research and access to innovative therapies for rare disease patients. Advancing the acceptance and use of real-world evidence (RWE): The Presidency should support greater integration of RWE in marketing authorizations and health technology assessments (HTA), enabling faster and more informed decision-making for new treatments throughout Europe. Encouraging the adoption of Early Access Programs (EAPs): By calling on member states to implement EAPs, especially for orphan medicinal products (OMPs), the Presidency can help patients with high unmet needs access promising therapies before full approval, while maintaining robust fiscal safeguards. To further support innovation and access, the Irish Presidency could lead efforts to: Strengthen IP protection: Within the legislative landscape, the EU Biotech Act should serve as a flagship priority. Ireland can help ensure the Act operates as a simplification instrument, enhancing IP protections, streamlining approvals and modernising ethical review processes – rather than creating new barriers. A competitive and globally attractive biotech ecosystem is essential for Europe’s scientific and industrial strength.

As one of Europe’s major financial services centres, our country will play a crucial role in the debate and delivery of a successful Savings and Investments Union (SIU) and on efforts around simplification and burden reduction for Europe’s economic activity. The SIU is a key objective of the European Commission (multiple legislative proposals in 2025 and more planned in their 2026 Work Programme) and Council (March 2024 Eurogroup statement on the future of Capital Markets Union). With this in mind, we propose the following two suggestions to be considered as part of the Presidency’s High-Level Thematic Priorities: Building on the Promise of the Savings and Investments Union for EU Citizens and the Real Economy Delivering Simplification to Enhance our Global Competitiveness These themes support a prosperous, resilient, and globally competitive EU economy, while directly addressing citizens’ long-term financial wellbeing, including challenges related to aging populations and pensions. They also reflect the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, which aims to improve citizens’ economic and social wellbeing and accelerate financial integration."

Given our role as one of the EU’s major financial services centres, we have a responsibility to play a leading role in the development of policy that impacts citizens, businesses, investors, and the wider economy.",2,"As noted in our response to Question 1, achieving substantial progress towards delivering a successful EU Savings and Investments Union (SIU) is critical to the EU’s long-term success. As the March 2024 Eurogroup statement explains, “Open, well-functioning, and integrated European capital markets are crucial to promote the single market and to attract the necessary investments, and thereby to boost the EU’s global competitiveness, innovation, sustainable growth, and job creation. It will provide better funding possibilities for growing companies, including small and medium-sized companies, and give EU citizens the opportunity to invest their savings more productively in Europe.” The Presidency should look to progress negotiations, ensuring thorough analysis of legislative proposals, on files related to the SIU programme as established in the European Commission’s SIU Communication (March 2025). These include: Market Integration and Supervision Package: This is a comprehensive legislative package that proposes amendments across the entire regulatory framework impacting investing (asset management, trading, post-trading, innovation, and supervisory structures). The Commission argues that its proposals will address EU capital market fragmentation, remove barriers to investment, and drive supervisory convergence. It is critical that we do not negatively impact those things that are working well, and here we would insist on the protection of the global UCITS brand – one of the biggest EU success stories. The Irish Presidency should facilitate rigorous debate of the Commission’s proposals and ensure there is ample time for detailed analysis of the wide-ranging proposals. Given the scale of the package, we would not expect the Irish Presidency to have reached a Council General Approach before the end of its Presidency but that it will have advanced the debate in Council. EU Securitization Framework Review: There is broad agreement on the need to revitalize Europe’s Securitization market. If successful, this could channel additional funding to EU businesses and spur innovation in Europe’s economy. The Irish Presidency should aim to reach a final agreement in trilogue by the end of 2026. Pensions Package: On 20 November 2025, the European Commission published a legislative package that proposes amendments to the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP) Regulation and the Directive on Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP II). Given the importance of delivering a better pensions environment for EU citizens and ensuring their long-term financial wellbeing is protected, the Irish Presidency should seek to advance negotiations in Council on both of these legislative proposals, potentially reaching Council General Approaches for each. SFDR 2.0: Recognizing continued challenges around the EU’s Sustainable Finance Framework, the European Commission issued a proposal for a legislative review of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on 20 November 2025. We believe that the Irish Presidency should aim to begin trilogue negotiations during its Presidency on the SFDR review."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefitsharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
352,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/1a5b1460/SWINFORD_BIOGAS_CONCERN_GROUP_-_Submission_352.docx,SWINFORD BIOGAS CONCERN GROUP,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “peoplecentred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, communityled projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
352,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/1a5b1460/SWINFORD_BIOGAS_CONCERN_GROUP_-_Submission_352.docx,SWINFORD BIOGAS CONCERN GROUP,,,,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agriinvestors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industryspecific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

For many years now, EU and Irish Drug Strategies have been underpinned by a common commitment to a whole-of-society approach, strengthening sectoral and partner co-operation and actively engaging civil society. This strong commitment to the crucial importance of having Civil Society and Community engagement at the heart of our response to drugs is reflected in both EU and Irish drug policy to date. Since it was formally established in 2008, the EU Civil Society Forum on Drugs (EU CSF) has played a crucial role in bringing the knowledge and experience of civil society from across the EU into its policymaking process and, in Ireland, community involvement has been central to all of our policymaking structures in relation to drugs for the last 30 years, through the engagement of Community Reps in our National Oversight Structures and Local & Regional Drug & Alcohol Task Forces. Citywide Drugs Crisis Campaign has been an active member of the EU CSF since 2012, the Ana Liffey Drug Project and Merchant’s Quay have also been involved as Irish member organisations. During this time Citywide has continued to highlight the innovative and inclusive model of a Community Development Approach to Drugs that has developed in Ireland and which is now deeply rooted in our NDS, reflecting a commitment to addressing not just drug-related harms but also the underlying causes that give rise to these harms. Taoiseach Micheál Martin, in his address to Citywide’s recent event to mark its 30th anniversary, restated the commitment of the Irish government to this approach “Challenges with drugs and substance abuse are experienced in every town, every city across Ireland, but the drivers and catalysts for these problems can vary substantially from community to community. That’s why the community development approach is so vital as it focuses on listening to the community members themselves – supporting them to identify their own unique challenges and working to address them.” A similar commitment to addressing underlying causes is reflected in the new EU Drugs Strategy, which sets out the need for a strong alignment between the Drugs Strategy and the forthcoming EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, which, in turn, sets out to address the multiple dimensions and structural causes of exclusion. Consultation on our next NDS will be ongoing during the first half of 2026 between the Dept of Health and the Oireachtas Committee on Drugs, with the Committee due to present its Final Report to government in June 2026. This presents an ideal opportunity to launch Ireland’s next National Drugs Strategy during the second half of 2026 at an event in Dublin to be hosted by the Taoiseach as part of the EU Presidency, and with EU Drug Ministers and our partners from EU Civil Society invited to attend."

In this context, an ongoing focus on maintaining and enhancing competitiveness to support continued economic growth must be a key priority for Ireland’s Presidency. Cork Chamber members emphasise the importance of a horizontal approach to competitiveness, strengthening factors within domestic and European control to mitigate the impact of external developments. Regulatory Simplification: In line with the recommendations made in the Draghi Report and other policy documents, progressing the simplification of EU regulation and legislative burdens will be critical in 2026. The simplification of overarching legislative and regulatory frameworks must be accompanied by enhanced supports for and investments in key policy areas that serve as a foundation for European businesses and communities to grow and thrive, such as innovation and research, and sustainability. The Single Market and Trade: Charting a course for a thriving Single Market and an environment in which European business can scale and grow is imperative, but must be accompanied by a recognition of the importance of balanced, regional economic development. In an era of geopolitical uncertainties, supporting market diversification and enhanced trade links with third countries is critical to the success of European business, as is managing EU relations with key partners such as the US. Supports for SMEs: Supporting SMEs to remain competitive is critical, and ensuring that regulatory frameworks are not overly burdensome for smaller enterprises must be a priority. This is particularly important as regulatory requirements in areas like sustainability continue to evolve, resulting in increased administrative and financial pressures on smaller organisations. Green and Digital Transitions: Key to Europe’s economic and population growth is a continued emphasis on both the green and digital transitions. Prioritisation of sustainability at all levels and a just transition for businesses and communities should be a core focus of Ireland’s Presidency. Ensuring that sustainability and climate goals are embedded in policymaking and practical actions at all levels is critical. Supporting businesses with clear, proportionate sustainability requirements is vital to ensure the continued competitiveness of Europe’s economy. This must be accompanied by bold action to accelerate the decarbonisation of Europe’s energy system, supporting a future of energy security and independence based on renewable sources. Deeper interconnection and collaboration in the European energy market is critical, alongside progress towards institutional decarbonisation, leveraging initiatives like the EU Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission of which both Cork and Dublin are participants. Harnessing the progress already made in the digital transition to support increased digitalisation across sectors should be prioritised. New and innovative technologies have the potential to support areas like sustainability reporting, for example, and this potential should be explored and leveraged where appropriate. Ensuring that businesses, particularly SMEs, can access digital tools and digitalise their operations is also critical. In parallel, support for innovation must continue, enabling the European tech sector to grow and develop."

In areas like sustainability reporting, simplification efforts must continue apace to reduce disproportionate administrative burdens affecting SMEs in particular. Progress on simplification, standardisation and the streamlining of regulatory requirements across policy areas will play an important role in enhancing competitiveness across Europe. The Irish Presidency should also seek to progress key national aims in this regard, such as the simplification of public procurement guidelines in line with the recommendations made by the recent Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce Report, in order to enable more efficient infrastructure and housing delivery at a national level. Plans for Omnibus proposals in areas like taxation should also be progressed, supporting the national measures to simplify taxation policy announced in Budget 2026. In addition, proposals to deepen Single Market integration, as well as proposals regarding particular sectors, should continue to be a key focus of legislative progress, building on the recommendations of the Letta Report and advancements already made to improve market access and trade potential. Proposals to develop strategies for certain key sectors such as tourism are also important in the context of strengthening Europe’s domestic economy and should be a key focus. Policy areas like research and innovation, supporting research capacity, skills development and talent mobility should be another core focus area for Ireland’s Presidency term. Strengthening EU support for these critical policy areas will also contribute to Europe’s ongoing competitiveness. Proposals in the area of gender equality, fair labour, talent mobility and digitalisation are also crucial in this regard and should be progressed. Continued progress on key legislative files in the area of climate and sustainability should also be maintained. Areas like energy security and independence, as well as energy market integration and infrastructural improvements, are already the subject of a number of legislative proposals. Maintaining momentum in these areas is key to the future of the green transition. With a revision of climate targets planned for the coming months, it is vital that the journey to climate neutrality is accelerated where possible, with due regard for the potential impacts on citizens. In parallel, continued progress on legislation that will support businesses and communities in their sustainability and decarbonisation journeys is crucial. Ensuring that legislative requirements are fair and proportionate will be critical in this regard."

As an island nation on the outermost edge of Europe, Ireland’s regional development serves as an important success story when it comes to economic growth and regional investment; surveys indicating continued high support for Ireland’s EU membership are testament to this. Ireland’s Presidency presents an important opportunity to showcase Ireland’s regions on the European stage, demonstrating the transformative impact of EU membership. Hosting both high-level and citizen engagement events in regions across Ireland during the Presidency term should be prioritised, promoting continued engagement with regions and ensuring that the benefits of EU membership and possibilities for engagement with EU legislative developments are better understood. As Ireland’s second city and the key economic driver of the southern region, Cork should be considered as a potential location for events during the Presidency, both high-level and citizen-focused. Similarly, the Presidency presents an opportunity to encourage engagement with the Single Market. Supporting Irish businesses in accessing the Single Market and cross-border trade opportunities should be prioritised, as well as the promotion of Irish business in other Member States. Showcasing opportunities for talent mobility, cross-border research and innovation initiatives, and other collaborative programmes should form part of planned activities to accompany the Presidency term.

While the majority of those surveyed were aware that Ireland would take on the Presidency of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2026, most were not aware of related events and activities. Ensuring that there is a higher level of awareness among both businesses and the wider population of European activities and initiatives during the Presidency term should therefore be a key focus of planning for the Presidency. Engaging with local and regional organisations to support regional events and citizen engagement initiatives, particularly youth engagement, should be explored in this regard. Alongside the high-level goals of the Presidency with regard to legislative developments and progress, there should be a focus on promoting social inclusion insofar as possible, through effective communication campaigns targeted regional, rural and disadvantaged communities who may typically feel excluded from European initiatives. The promotion of EU-funded programmes and initiatives to organisations should also be explored, ensuring that effective communications and guidelines are supplied to those who may be interested in participating.

But the Commission adds that a person should only be liable if he or she was mentally and physically capable of averting to, and avoiding the risk of death at the time of the fatality. The Legal Test (Ireland) Gross Negligence Manslaughter Duty of Care: The defendant must have owed a legal duty of care to the deceased (e.g., landlord to tenant, doctor to patient). Breach of Duty: The defendant breached this duty through an act or omission. Causation: The breach must have directly caused the death. Gross Negligence: This is the key element, judged by the jury: The negligence must be of a very high degree, significantly more than ordinary carelessness or the standard for civil liability. It must involve a serious and obvious risk of death, not just injury, to others.

Given the troubling state of the world, we can use our Presidency to promote the ingredients that make for successful, sustainable and peaceful societies. These include fundamental values, obligations and principles that are intrinsic to the EU and international legal orders. For example, on equality and human rights. Leadership next year therefore should be demonstrated by returning the EU to its foundational values in a world of conflict, war and growing disrespect for a rules-based order and its associated institutions. Too many states now operate with impunity and mock the values we claim to cherish. Ireland has managed a peaceful transition based on fundamental values and principles. Our island is facing into another transition in the years ahead – as the choice envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement will be exercised. These realities - for our shared island, for Europe and the world - should shape the approach that Ireland takes next year."

This remains a hugely significant development in the circumstances of Brexit. An EU promise to all the people of Northern Ireland. Moves towards constitutional change will happen within an EU member state. And because of this, Ireland has a responsibility to commence discussions with its European partners – and associated institutions – on the implications. There are multiple ways this can be achieved, publicly and privately, but in particular it would be of assistance to expand existing research efforts to embrace the European implications. That could include expert seminars, roundtables and events that explore constitutional transitions across Europe and internationally. Preparations for constitutional change in Ireland must therefore also include EU member states and institutions. Linked to this, the Presidency should ensure that Northern Ireland is fully included before, during and after. For example, proposals for observer status in the European Parliament should be advanced and connected to ongoing work to address the serious ongoing risk of deep and destabilising divergence on the island of Ireland."

Ensuring that civic space actors are centrally involved at all stages. As indicated above, this is also about guaranteeing that the EU holds to its own fundamental values that secure protections for everyone: that will send a robust signal to the world. If the EU is serious about its own foundations, much more should be done to raise awareness of the role of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the work of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, and the necessity of respect for international law. This will include delivering an unequivocal message to those states that operate with impunity and continue to demonstrate contempt for international law. We need to remind ourselves, time and again, about the values that we are defending and why they matter. When the EU fails to live up to these values, we must say so. In Ireland this also means that the Irish Government should be open to the transition facing this island. The choice envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement is on the horizon. It will bring all the opportunities and benefits of EU membership for the people of Northern Ireland once again. A new and united Ireland within the EU is a realisable objective. We are constitutionally committed to this outcome. It is a choice promised to the people of Ireland. Communicating openly about the nature of our peace process - and what it means for Ireland’s future - is part of ensuring that Ireland can be trusted as a good faith actor in these conversations. In particular, work on the implications for the EU, the role the EU will play, and lesson learning from comparative experience in Europe should be part of this agenda. Many across Europe already know and understand this and are awaiting principled leadership from the Irish Government."

According to the WHO, mental health conditions are one of the leading causes of illness among young people, with more than half of these conditions emerging before the age of 14. Anxiety, depression and behavioural disorders are three leading causes of morbidity among adolescents. Young people face unique and distinct challenges and require a distinct focus on their mental health needs, with tailored, adequate support based on their specific challenges and life experiences. Untreated mental health issues in adolescence and young adulthood significantly contribute to a range of negative health outcomes across a person’s entire lifespan. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has found that one in seven children and adolescents aged 0-19 lives with a mental health condition, and that this number is increasing as time goes on. At the same time, the WHO has determined that one in five countries lack policies to support the mental health of children and young people. These issues are connected with the growing crisis of loneliness among young people in Europe, to which Irish young people are particularly at risk. Research by the European Commission has shown that Ireland has the highest reported rates of loneliness in Europe (20% self-reporting as lonely vs 13% of all Europeans). This problem is particularly and increasingly acute for young people and has a strong connection with the growing mental health crisis in our country and our continent."

The Council’s work will rightly and necessarily involve a great deal of consideration of ‘high-level’ geopolitical concerns facing the European Union; however, in order for the idea of the EU to mean something to young people across the continent, it is critical that they see the Council taking a serious and sustained interest in solving the most critical issues facing them in their own lives; of which mental health challenges and lack of appropriate services are among the most pressing, in addition to challenges facing young people relating to accessing high-quality youth information.

As they face increasing challenges of isolation, social atomisation, and mental health crisis, young people increasingly feel a sense of hopelessness and despair in relation to their democratic institutions. All European member states are dealing, in some way, with the fraying of the social contract as young people increasingly feel the promise of a better life for each subsequent generation has been abandoned. Young people will only feel true ownership of the European Union if and when they feel directly consulted, engaged and responded to by its institutions. spunout intends to run a Young Citizens’ Assembly in 2026, bringing together young people from all parts of the country to express their views on the crucial policy issues most important to them.

300,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/0a0ae1ff/Epilepsy_Ireland_-_Submission_300.docx,Epilepsy Ireland,,,,1,"As representative of the 45,000 people living with epilepsy in Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland believe that delivering the World Health Organisation’s Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and Neurological (WHO IGAP) conditions should be a high-level thematic priority for Ireland’s presidency of the European council. This would not only benefit people with epilepsy, but also the entire neurological community in Ireland; with 800,000 people living with a Neurological condition in Ireland. The WHO IGAP was adopted by all EU members states in 2022, and called on all countries to: To raise the prioritisation of, and strengthen governance for, epilepsy and other neurological disorders. To provide effective, timely and responsive diagnosis, treatment, and care for all patients. To implement strategies for promotion and prevention of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. To foster research and innovation into, and strengthen information systems, for epilepsy and other neurological disorders. To strengthen the public health approach to epilepsy. Given the successes that Ireland has achieved by enabling a national focus on epilepsy and by resourcing (in part at least) the implementation of a national programme, the IGAP now provides us with an opportunity to collaboratively develop and implement the next level of critical transformation that is required here. For example, we still have one of the lowest ratios of consultant neurologists per head of population in Europe; we need to better integrate clinical genetics into epilepsy diagnosis and treatment; expand our epilepsy surgery programme; embed new e-health technologies into clinical practice; and there is an urgent need to tackle preventable epilepsy deaths including those from Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Ireland has a proud recent history in leading the way on the international and European stage. For example, we created a global domino effect being the first country to introduce a smoking ban in 2004; and in 2015, we were the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage by popular vote. Our presidency of the EU in 2026 offers another opportunity to lead the way, by committing to the goals and targets of the IGAP on epilepsy and other neurological disorders – something that will have a national and European impact."
300,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/0a0ae1ff/Epilepsy_Ireland_-_Submission_300.docx,Epilepsy Ireland,,,,2,"Under IGAP, national governments are required to take concrete steps to ensure that the targets set out in the plan are achieved by 2031 via several policy/legislative initiatives. These include ensuring that every country has at least one functioning awareness campaign or advocacy programme for neurological disorders, doubling global research output on neurological conditions, increasing service coverage for epilepsy by 50% from the 2021 baseline, and ensuring that 80% of countries have developed or updated legislation to promote and protect the human rights of people with epilepsy. Establishing an action plan to meet these targets under the auspices of Ireland’s EU Presidency would not only set a strong European example but also inspire global action, encouraging member states to follow suit. Ireland could seek Council support for the implementation of these key objectives and promote coordinated measures to address the shortage of specialist services, while highlighting positive developments at home, such as the publication of the Model of Care for epilepsy. In the area of research and innovation, our Presidency could advocate for the Horizon programme to prioritize epilepsy and neurological research, showcasing Ireland’s leadership through initiatives like FutureNeuro—Research Ireland’s world-class epilepsy and neurology research centre at the Royal College of Surgeons. This approach would strengthen EU research collaborations and accelerate progress in understanding and treating neurological conditions, delivering benefits for patients, science, and society."
300,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/0a0ae1ff/Epilepsy_Ireland_-_Submission_300.docx,Epilepsy Ireland,,,,3,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a tendency to experience recurring seizures. In Ireland, over 45,000 people live with epilepsy, including 10,000–15,000 individuals who endure uncontrolled seizures. For this group in particular, the consequences can be profound and long-lasting, affecting education, employment, social participation, self-esteem, and independent living. Beyond these challenges, people with epilepsy must cope with the physical impact of seizures, the side effects of medication, and, for many, the social stigma and economic burden that often accompany the condition. Its deeply individual impact means epilepsy is frequently regarded as a hidden disability. Prioritising the implementation of IGAP during our presidency would send a powerful message to people living with epilepsy and other neurological conditions: that they are seen and valued. Through IGAP, we can address many of the obstacles they face, ensuring earlier diagnosis, access to appropriate medicines, surgical assessment where indicated, and coordinated community supports. For the wider European community, EU-led or supported awareness campaigns can play a vital role in reducing stigma and fostering a more inclusive and understanding society across Europe. The benefits of implementing IGAP extend beyond healthcare. A strong research and data agenda will accelerate innovation in therapeutics, diagnostics, and digital tools—creating opportunities for SMEs and industry while addressing unmet medical needs. This approach not only improves lives but also strengthens Europe’s position as a leader in brain health and neurological research."

In our view, the true value of EU membership lies in its ability to foster a community that is collaborative, understanding, and supportive of every individual. We believe that prioritising the implementation of the IGAP and thereby focusing on a section of society that often feels underrepresented, undervalued, and misunderstood, is a powerful way to demonstrate the benefits of EU membership. Introducing a clear action plan to improve the lives of those affected will not only deliver tangible change but also showcase the EU’s commitment to inclusivity and care. Communicating these efforts will, in itself, help advance some of IGAP’s key objectives by raising awareness and increasing understanding of epilepsy and other neurological conditions. With limited progress made so far on IGAP implementation, Ireland has a unique opportunity to use the platform of our presidency to drive meaningful action. By doing so, we can spark a ripple effect across Europe, encouraging broader adoption and progress. Such leadership would be recognised by our citizens as a clear example of Irish initiative and ownership, reinforcing our reputation as a nation that leads with purpose and compassion."

The WHO IGAP sets ambitious targets for 2031, aiming to drive universal awareness, double global research output, significantly expand service coverage, and strengthen human rights protections. Ireland is well-positioned to lead on this agenda, with a strong foundation that includes advanced clinical programmes, a growing specialist workforce, an epilepsy-specific electronic patient record, and FutureNeuro—a world-class epilepsy and neurolgy research centre. By showcasing these achievements while acknowledging the challenges and realities faced by people living with epilepsy, Ireland can spark an EU-wide conversation during our presidency that transforms IGAP commitments into measurable progress. We propose that Ireland uses its Presidency to secure Council Conclusions endorsing IGAP implementation across the EU, convene a High-Level Meeting on Brain Health with concrete deliverables on workforce development, digital health, and outcomes data, and launch an EU-wide awareness partnership to combat stigma while informing citizens about rights, safety—including SUDEP risk reduction—and access pathways.

Across the Union, mental illness is now a major public-health and socio-economic issue. The European Commission’s 2023 Communication “A Comprehensive Approach to Mental Health” and the European Parliament’s 2024 resolution on mental health both recognise this. The 2024–2029 EU Strategic Agenda commits the Union to strengthening resilience, protecting democracy, and promoting social cohesion. Mental health, and the structural factors shaping it, cut directly across these priorities. From Shine’s perspective, Ireland should champion three Presidency themes: 1. A People-Centred and Inclusive Europe: This would signal the importance of social protection, wellbeing, equality, and inclusion for all citizens, including those living with mental illness. It aligns with EPSCO Council work on mental-health integration across health, employment, and social-policy frameworks. 2. A Resilient and Healthy Europe: This theme should explicitly include mental health as a core pillar of public-health resilience, alongside preparedness for digital transformation, economic uncertainty, and demographic change. 3. A Rights-Based and Participatory Europe: Shine strongly supports an EU that centres lived experience and participation, reflecting UNCRPD principles and ongoing EU work on equality, anti-discrimination, and social inclusion.

Shine recommends prioritising the following: 1. Implementation of the EU’s Comprehensive Approach to Mental Health While the Communication is not legislation, Council configurations (EPSCO; Education, Youth, Culture and Sport) will be dealing with its rollout. Ireland can guide progress on: embedding mental-health targets within existing EU social-policy frameworks; promoting early intervention and community-based supports; strengthening cross-border access to mental-health information and services (building on the European Health Data Space Regulation). 2. Strengthening Social Inclusion and Anti-Discrimination Law This includes work expected under the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme on: improving the implementation of the EU Equality Directives; progressing long-delayed measures on non-discrimination outside employment; enhancing rights protections for people with psychosocial disabilities. 3. Digital Policy and AI Governance Mental-health impacts of digital transformation, including social-media harms, misinformation, and risks created by generative AI, should receive explicit focus. Ireland can lead discussions on: ensuring the EU AI Act is implemented with strong protections for vulnerable groups; promoting safe digital environments for young people; supporting research on digital determinants of mental health. 4. Employment, Poverty and Social-Protection Measures The EU Strategic Agenda identifies economic resilience and fair transitions as core priorities. The Presidency can help advance: renewed measures to reduce poverty and social exclusion; employment initiatives that remove barriers faced by people living with mental illness; stronger employer obligations around workplace mental health under the EU’s occupational-safety framework. What Ireland should aim to achieve Ireland should aim for: formal Council conclusions that strengthen the EU’s commitment to mental health across all policies; progress on files that enhance equality, participation, and social protection; greater visibility of lived-experience leadership in EU policy; practical, implementable outcomes rather than high-level statements."

Strengthen the rights and participation of people with lived experience A Presidency that embeds lived experience sets a standard for participatory policymaking. Ireland is well positioned to showcase models of NGO-government partnership and co-production. 3. Prioritise concrete, actionable outcomes Citizens will only experience “substantial positive impact” if 2026 produces measurable improvements. This includes: better access to mental-health supports; reduced stigma and discrimination; improvements in digital safety; stronger social-protection measures; commitment to inclusive labour markets.

Visibility of community and NGO voices Including NGOs, lived-experience advocates, young people, and local organisations in the Presidency narrative will help build ownership. Ireland has a strong civil-society sector that can communicate EU benefits credibly. 3. Engagement outside traditional political spaces To reach people who feel disconnected from EU institutions, Ireland should prioritise: community-based events; regional town-hall sessions; targeted digital campaigns aimed at younger audiences and marginalised communities. 4.

One of the key themes should be supporting and empowering Europe’s Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries (CCSIs) in the digital age. The Irish Presidency should continue the work of the current Danish Presidency and make AI and copyright a cornerstone of its agenda, express a clear intention to embed digital and cultural policy in Europe’s competitiveness and security agenda. The European CCSIs, including the media sector, are central to the EU’s economic and cultural strength. They provide around 17 million jobs and contribute roughly 7% of EU GDP. Beyond their economic impact, these sectors express the heart of Europe’s identity, diversity, and democratic principles. Europe’s longstanding leadership in art, media, and culture has shaped its global influence. Yet this position is increasingly under pressure due to rapid technological change, especially the rise of AI and other frontier technologies, without said change being accompanied by fit-for-purpose legal protections allowing rightsholders to exercise and enforce their copyright and related rights. EU policy must evolve toward a digital environment that is both innovative and fair, one that protects and promotes European creativity. The unauthorised use of large quantities of creative works for AI training and other copyright-relevant AI-related purposes poses real risks for the sector’s sustainability and for the livelihoods of authors, artists, publishers, and other rightsholders. In many cases, creative content has been copied, processed, and monetised without permission or payment, undermining the exclusive rights guaranteed by EU copyright law. This disrespect of EU rules not only threatens the economic foundations of creative professions but also weakens public trust in technology. Ireland could prioritise a theme: “Culture, Creativity, and Fair Innovation in the Digital Era” Under this banner, the Presidency could work to strengthen the protection of authors, artists, publishers, and rightsholders by promoting robust implementation and enforceability of the EU copyright acquis; ensuring full, actionable transparency in AI purposes; promoting licensing; and exploring fair remuneration models when creative works are used by generative AI models and systems. Given Ireland’s strong history and experience of regulation, the wide number of technology companies based in Ireland and strength of the sectors where AI is having a significant impact, such as music and pharma, together with the breadth and reputation of Irish literary work, we are perhaps uniquely positions towards a responsible, ethical and rights-respecting AI environment."
393,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e7be85da/Irish_Copyright_Licensing_Agency_ICLA_-_Submission_393.docx,Irish Copyright Licensing Agency (ICLA),,,,2,"A key priority for the Irish Presidency in 2026 should be strengthening the EU copyright framework to ensure effective protection of authors, publishers, rightsholders and their creative works in the AI era. As generative AI technologies increasingly rely on large-scale ingestion and reproduction of creative content, the EU must reinforce rules that safeguard creators, preserve cultural diversity and support sustainable media and cultural ecosystems. All of this work should be guided by the long-standing principles of international and EU copyright law. At the core is the three-step test, set out in the Berne Convention and embedded throughout the EU copyright system. Under this test, any exception to copyright must be limited to specific cases, must not interfere with the normal use of a work, and must not unfairly harm the legitimate interests of rightsholders. This remains the key standard for assessing any proposal to broaden exceptions or limitations. The Irish Presidency should make clear that this principle continues to apply to all EU policy developments, including those involving AI, text and data mining, and the digital use of protected content. In addition, the Presidency could assess and further examine the European Parliament’s proposal to establish an irrebuttable presumption that, for any general-purpose AI model or system placed on the Union market, copyright-protected works and other protected subject matter have been used for training whenever the applicable transparency obligations have not been fully met."
393,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e7be85da/Irish_Copyright_Licensing_Agency_ICLA_-_Submission_393.docx,Irish Copyright Licensing Agency (ICLA),,,,3,"First and foremost, the Presidency should prioritise open dialogues and inclusiveness with the directly impacted stakeholders (authors, artists, publishers, rightsholders in general and collective management organisations). Building on the work of previous Presidencies (the Danish and, before this, the Polish and Hungarian ones), Ireland could organize structured consultations, expert conferences, and targeted questionnaires to collect evidence and perspectives from across Member States and sectors to assess the impact of AI and digital technologies on Europe’s creative and information ecosystems. Ensuring that all voices (large and small businesses, CCSIs, civil society, and academia) are represented will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of EU policymaking and help achieve balanced and future-proof outcomes. Inclusive dialogue would also facilitate a more coherent implementation of existing EU frameworks. While much attention has been given to audiovisual and music industries, the text, image and publishing sectors, including journalism, literature, visual arts and translation, have faced some of the earliest and most profound disruptions. Generative AI is trained and subsequently built upon vast volumes of protected written and visual material, including press content, literary and visual works, often without authorisation, credit, or remuneration. This not only undermines the rights of authors and publishers but also distorts the market by enabling AI-generated content that is often misleading, unverified, and hallucinatory, competing unfairly with authentic, human-created work."

The Irish Presidency could take the lead by running an EU-wide awareness campaign that uses visuals, short videos, infographics, and personal stories to clearly explain what the EU has achieved and how its policies make everyday life better. People are more likely to feel connected to their European identity when they understand what it means and why it matters. Sharing regular, easy-to-follow updates on the Presidency’s priorities, decisions, and results, through the accessible channels mentioned above, can help make the Council’s work feel less distant or complicated. Showing how Ireland’s leadership is shaping EU policy on real-life issues like protecting culture and the creative workers would strengthen its image as a positive and influential voice in Europe. Iti is also important for the Presidency to resist any simplification agenda which would erode fundamental rights of creators or undermine the legal certainty provided by the EU copyright framework."

FEANTSA, the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless estimate that 1.2m people in Europe are either sleeping rough or accessing emergency accommodation. Ursula von der Leyen, in her State of the Union address recently said that what Europe is experiencing is “more than a housing crisis, it is a social crisis” and promised that the forthcoming Affordable Housing Plan will be “a European effort anchored in local realities”. While housing will remain a national competency, the European Commission providing high-level leadership on this issue in delivering an Affordable Housing Plan is a recognition of the vital role housing plays in social cohesion. The forthcoming EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, expected in Spring 2026, will focus on addressing structural inequality including how this manifests in housing terms through homelessness. Both the Affordable Housing Plan and the Anti-Poverty Strategy are outlined in the 2026 Commission Work Programme therefore a high-level thematic priority that focuses on housing and homelessness would be very much in keeping with policies that will begin their implementation during the Irish Presidency as well as resonating locally where housing remains one of the most pressing social issues. Ireland has recently launched a new housing plan, “Delivering Homes, Building Communities”, which aims to deliver 300,000 additional homes by 2030. This plan builds on plans launched in 2016 and 2020. The AHB sector was and is central to delivering the social and affordable housing commitments in these plans. As a sector we believe there is an opportunity to highlight some of challenges and successes with a housing summit hosted by Ireland during the Presidency. There is already a successful model which the sector is happy to work with other key stakeholders to replicate. The International Social Housing Festival which was hosted by the ICSH in June 2025 in Dublin. Ireland’s Presidency priorities will focus on addressing shared challenges across EU member states and housing is also central to several other of these common issues such as competitiveness, EU budgets including a Multiannual Framework Budget and adapting and preparing for climate change. Ireland’s EU presidency comes at a key time when State Aid rules are being revised to help Member States with the delivery of social and affordable housing and the EU initiates the use of the Social Climate Fund to deliver member states’ Social Climate Plans to ensure a Just Transition for “vulnerable” households. Measures such as increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, the renovation of buildings, the decarbonisation of heating and cooling in buildings set out in these plans are aligned with housing as a central-theme."

Since then, progress on working towards this aim has been inconsistent across Member States. The European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH), in which the DHLGH is involved, has delivered important outcomes in the areas of mutual learning, monitoring and promotion of good practices. However, there is no clear roadmap at EU level on how the aim of ending homelessness by 2030 will be achieved. As homelessness is such an acute and unfortunately growing issue within Europe, we would hope to see a Council of Ministers meeting on this issue during the Irish Presidency to include a recommendation on ending homelessness. This would reaffirm the principles and objectives of the Lisbon Declaration and, taken in tandem with the roll-out of the Affordable Housing Plan and Anti-Poverty Strategy, would deliver the strongest possible guidance to Member States on the need for progress on ending homelessness. When it comes to housing more generally, the EU has identified priority areas to support Member States to address structural drivers and unlock public and private investment for affordable and sustainable housing, as follows: Establish a pan-European investment platform for affordable and sustainable housing Inject liquidity into the housing market and double the planned cohesion policy investments in affordable housing Revise state aid rules to make it easier for member states to support affordable housing Develop a European Strategy for Housing Construction to support housing supply Tackle systemic issues with short-term accommodation rentals and analyse the impact of housing speculation Bring down energy bills and reduce energy poverty to make homes affordable, decent, and sustainable Through the Affordable Housing Dialogue we will identify further areas where there could be European added value We expect the EU Affordable Housing Plan due for release in December 2025 to set out the role of the European Commission in addressing these cross-cutting policy and legislative areas, that could be further developed and actioned through Ireland hosting the EU Housing Summit during the term of its EU presidency. The Public Procurement Act and the delivery of housing should also be tied in to the Green Deal and the climate change agenda."

It is about fairness. And it is about Europe's future. Eight years ago, the European Pillar of Social Rights made housing a social right in Europe. It's time to turn this promise into reality.” Housing access and affordability is a challenge across the European Union and is having a negative impact on people, business and communities. There is a unique opportunity to work together across these three strands to share and promote workable and replicable solutions to the housing crisis. In December 2025, the EU will publish its first ever EU Affordable Housing Plan, and Ireland through its EU presidency will be in a position to influence the transition of this plan from words into action in the early days of its implementation, which will impact on the lives of all EU residents. Ireland is in a unique position to show leadership in this regard in terms of the levels of government support it is currently providing for the delivery of the housing (being one of the highest capital spenders in Europe on a per capita basis), and having demonstrated the capacity to (i) scale up the delivery of social housing over the last decade at an unprecedented pace through non-profit providers in partnership with private sector builders, developers and local authorities, and (ii) successfully create a new tenure of cost rental housing to address affordability challenges for “the squeezed middle” who earn too much to qualify for social housing and which is currently being scaled up in delivery through social housing providers, local authorities and a publicly owned “state developer” in the form of the Land Development Authority."

Spotlighting the work that Europe is doing on housing and homelessness, as well as the scale up of retrofit programmes, especially those targeted at the inclusion of vulnerable groups such as tenants of social housing, and re-affirming it through a Council of Ministers recommendation could underline the benefits of EU membership and make its work more tangible for all."

The new national housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities, along with the forthcoming EU Affordable Housing Plan provides us with a unique platform to host a housing summit. There is an appetite to share information and solutions across Europe as evidenced by the number of attendees at the International Social Housing Festival (ISHF) hosted by the ICSH in Dublin last June. The ICSH facilitated many site visits to exemplary social and affordable housing schemes across Dublin as part of the ISHF and we would be very willing to showcase what the approved housing body sector has achieved as part of any forthcoming housing related events. European funding has contributed to the development of many social and affordable housing projects in Dublin and across Ireland. European Investment Bank and Council of Europe Development Bank funding has been crucial for many schemes. In addition, European funding through Interreg, Horizon Europe, Erasmus, Erasmus+ and the Leonard da Vinci programmes have contributed to the climate innovation, retrofitting and education and training development of the approved housing body sector. Ireland’s record in social and affordable housing delivery, and especially in recent years, the development of cost rental housing, has been something that other European member states have been keen to examine and learn from. Approved housing bodies have led the way in the development of cost rental housing as a mechanism to increase affordable housing options for middle income groups. The sector has delivered over 2,000 cost rental homes since the scheme’s inception with a strong pipeline of many thousands more to be delivered. In the ICSH, we have a very strong track record of facilitating knowledge exchanges between practitioners across Europe and would be very willing to be part of any such work during Ireland’s presidency."

Values such as respect, diversity, inclusion and accessibility should guide the Presidency’s high-level priorities. A first theme should be Accessibility and Inclusion. These are essential to ensuring that everyone can live, work, travel and participate fully in European society. Ireland should champion accessibility as a shared European value, in line with our obligations under the UNCRPD. A second theme should be A People-Focused Digital Future. As digital systems increasingly shape our lives, the EU must ensure digital developments are trustworthy, safe and accessible from the start. This means embedding sign language access, captioning and universal design into AI systems, online platforms and public digital services. A third theme should be Strengthening Democracy and Community Participation. Ireland is well placed to highlight how accessible information, inclusive public dialogue and community engagement build trust in European institutions. Ensuring that Deaf and disabled people can engage with EU processes is vital to democracy. These priorities would reflect Ireland’s reputation for fairness and leadership in equality, while providing a positive and forward-looking vision for the EU."

Ireland’s Presidency offers a valuable opportunity to shape practical progress on rights, accessibility and equality across the EU. For the Irish Deaf Society, several policy areas deserve particular focus. First, the Presidency should prioritise strong and consistent implementation of the European Accessibility Act. As key provisions take effect from 2025 onwards, Ireland can support Member States navigate challenges, share good practice and ensure that accessibility obligations, such as accessible digital content, consumer goods and communication standards deliver meaningful improvements for citizens. Second, Ireland should continue advancing the EU Disability Rights Strategy 2021-2030, ensuring that UNCRPD principles underpin Council discussions across all areas. This includes progress on the European Disability Card, accessible transport, inclusive employment and access to justice. Third, digital policy requires particular care. As the EU rolls out the AI Act and develops further digital measures, Ireland should champion accessibility by design. Digital products and services must include sign languages, captioning and usability standards from the outset, not as an afterthought. Finally, Ireland could play a constructive role in highlighting the EU’s rich linguistic diversity, including national sign languages. Promoting accessible public information, emergency communication and recognition of sign language rights will contribute to a more cohesive European community."

Ireland’s Presidency can help ensure that Council work has real and lasting impact across communities, businesses and public services. A central way to achieve this is by mainstreaming accessibility across all policy discussions. Accessible legislation, communications, transport and digital services benefit everyone. They reduce barriers and support people to participate more fully in work, education and public life. Ireland can also ensure that civil society and DPOs are meaningfully included throughout the Presidency. When people with lived experience help shape policy, the outcomes are stronger, more practical and more widely supported. This reflects the UNCRPD principle of “nothing about us without us”. Another important contribution lies in building public trust. Inclusive communication, including sign language interpretation, captions and accessible formats, will help ensure that people across the EU understand and feel connected to the work being done in their name. Finally, Ireland can champion initiatives that remove cross-border barriers, whether in travel, digital public services,or consumer rights. When people can move freely, access services easily and trust that their rights apply wherever they go, the EU becomes more relevant and beneficial to everyday life. By promoting inclusion, fairness and practical solutions, Ireland can help shape an EU that people genuinely feel a part of."

To foster a strong sense of ownership over the Presidency, communication must be open, accessible and community-focused. A first step is ensuring that all Presidency information is fully accessible, including Irish Sign Language interpretation, captioning, Plain English materials and clear multilingual communication. When people can access the information, they can engage. Ireland should also work closely with DPOs, community organisations, youth groups and schools. People connect best with Europe when they can see the relevance in their own daily lives, whether that’s through accessible public services, travel rights, digital protections or cultural exchange. Sharing real stories of how EU membership supports people, businesses, students and communities across Ireland can help make the benefits concrete and relatable. Short videos in ISL, local media features and community events would resonate strongly. The Presidency also offers an opportunity to highlight Ireland’s own linguistic and cultural diversity, including Irish Sign Language. Visibility of ISL at public events sends a powerful message about inclusion and equality, both Irish values and European ones. Finally, we can build a sense of collective ownership by giving people opportunities to participate, whether through consultations, online forums, town-hall events or accessible digital platforms. By focusing on openness, accessibility and community connection, Ireland can help citizens feel both informed about and included in the work of the EU."

For several years, the European institutions have maintained a focus on addressing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and implementing prevention measures. The EU launched its Healthier Together – NCDs initiative in December 2021 which aimed to reduce the burden of major NCDs and improve citizens’ health and well-being. This included 5 strands: health determinants, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and mental health. In June 2024, under the Belgian Presidency, the Council adopted a set of conclusions on the Future of the European Health Union, which call for further actions to prevent non-communicable diseases and for addressing priority needs in healthcare. At the same time, the European Commission has worked on Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan that was published in 2021, accompanied by a Council recommendation for a new approach on cancer screening in 2022 under Czechia’s Presidency. Following a set of Council conclusions on the improvement of cardiovascular health in the European Union in December 2024 led by the Hungarian Presidency, the Commission is now expected to adopt a strategy for an EU Cardiovascular Health Plan on 16 December 2025. The EU Cardiovascular Health Plan is likely to be an important topic of discussion in the upcoming Cypriot Presidency in the first half of 2026, as also requested by Commissioner Olivér Várhelyi in the latest EPSCO meeting. One important aspect that is missing from all these initiatives is appropriate action to address obesity. EU level action on obesity is critical as obesity is now the fourth leading risk factor for mortality globally, followed by high blood pressure, dietary risks, and tobacco use. More specifically, in Europe, between 10-13% of all deaths are linked to obesity, making it a leading contributor to preventable mortality. Importantly, it is a chronic, relapsing disease that also acts as a gateway for other non-communicable diseases as it increases the risk for over 230 other conditions and NCDs. Despite its growing prevalence, and the significant health implications for people living with obesity, obesity has still not received the same attention at the EU-level as other NCDs. For example, even though the upcoming EU Cardiovascular Health Plan is expected to address obesity and diabetes, these diseases have been limited as simply risk factors for the development of CVDs within the Call for Evidence. In reality, obesity is a direct causal factor for several CVDs and managing obesity can reduce the prevalence of CVDs and other NCDs. It is clear that the Council has been very influential previously in progressing action on NCDs, specifically cancer and CVDs. We would like to see the Irish Presidency continue this important work, building on the discussions held by the Cypriot Presidency on cardiovascular health, by driving forward discussions on EU-level action on obesity."

While obesity is not specifically related to a specific legislative proposal, obesity is one of the most pressing health and societal challenges faced by Europe. Because it is a chronic, relapsing disease that also acts as a gateway to the development of several other NCDs, a coherent and comprehensive approach to addressing obesity is essential to reducing its impact on individuals, health systems and economies. As part of this focus on obesity, the Irish Presidency could aim to publish a set of Council Conclusions related to obesity that outlines the Council’s overall position on obesity and encourages the European Commission to take action through the development of a concrete EU Action Plan on Obesity, drawing on the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan and the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. It may also be beneficial to host an event in parallel with an EPSCO Council meeting to continue these discussions and bring additional stakeholders to the table to discuss the need for EU level action on obesity. As representatives of people living with obesity, researchers and practitioners working on obesity, we believe that the Irish Presidency is well-placed to drive forward the discussions that will lead to the development of an ambitious, patient-centred EU Action Plan on Obesity that encompasses preventive health measures and health promotion, improved screening and diagnosis, and comprehensive treatment and management. Some of the key aspects that should be considered by the Council include: • Adopting obesity as a health and societal priority, similar to other NCDs. The need to develop and implement comprehensive, multi-sectoral approaches to address obesity through comprehensive national plans and the establishment of multidisciplinary treatment pathways in line with other chronic diseases. Considering the need to work together with other NCDs, for example, by implementing joint obesity, diabetes and CVD health checks to reduce burden on healthcare systems and patients. Calling for research and funding opportunities, for example by launching an EU-funded project on health literacy in obesity or for advancing the research agenda. Implementing comprehensive obesity education in medical, nursing, and health professional curricula. The Irish Presidency can take a leadership role in driving forward these discussions by building on the work the Irish government has already undertaken on obesity through its Irish Obesity Policy and Action Plan for 2016-2025, which is currently being revised for 2026 onwards."

One of the most pressing of these is the rising prevalence of obesity, particularly as it is a gateway to other NCDs and significantly affects the quality of life of people living with the disease. In Ireland alone, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in the last 3 decades and 21% of Irish adults were living with BMI-defined obesity in 2024. There is a strong socio-economic gradient to obesity prevalence, and large inequalities in health status exist according to socio-economic status in Ireland. More broadly in the EU, 23% of adults were estimated to have BMI-defined obesity. Living with overweight or obesity affects far more than health – it can shape people’s daily lives and opportunities. These conditions also create a substantial strain on healthcare systems and national economies. The impact extends into workplaces and communities, where stigma, reduced opportunities and health complications can contribute to absences and lower productivity. In 2019, the economic impact of overweight and obesity in the EU was estimated at approximately €141 billion in direct healthcare costs and €323 billion in wider societal costs such as lost productivity. The OECD has also estimated that the impact of obesity and its related conditions will reduce GDP by 3.3% due to these factors of absences and decreased productivity. Ireland is already a leader in action on obesity, both at the policy level through evidence-based approaches such as the Model of Care for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Ireland as well as at the practice level through a set of published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Obesity in Adults in Ireland and national education and training initiatives for health professionals. The CPGs align with existing evidence-based principles of chronic disease management and shift the goals of management from weight change alone to patient-centred health and functional outcomes that improve the overall health, social and economic wellbeing of people living with obesity and their communities. In 2025, Ireland was identified as a world leader in its innovative approaches to integrated obesity care and hosted the World Health Organization Demonstration Platform for Obesity – showcasing our national collaborative approach across HSE, ASOI, ICPO and the Department of Health. Therefore, we believe that the Irish Presidency can make a significant impact by placing obesity high on the Council’s agenda. Addressing obesity requires a coordinated approach and integrated policy action across several areas including health, the environment, education and industry. By sharing the effective practices and policies that have already been adopted and implemented in Ireland and promoting similar action across the EU, the Irish Presidency can make a significant impact that improves the health and well being of EU citizens and communities."

The Irish Presidency has an ideal opportunity to showcase how Ireland has taken a leading role in addressing obesity through concrete policy and practical actions and highlighting how Ireland can influence policy action at the EU level. Taking a leading role in addressing one of the most pressing public health and societal challenges facing both Ireland and the EU as a whole is something that citizens should be proud of. In the field of obesity, the Irish Government has already made big strides in addressing obesity through the Irish Obesity Policy and Action Plan for 2016-2025. This plan includes a comprehensive, crosssectoral approach to obesity prevention through Healthy Ireland Implementation Plans and Slaintecare Healthy Communities initiatives. It also included the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Obesity (NCPO) and the publication of the Model of Care for the Management of Overweight and Obesity in Ireland. In addition to action at policy level, ASOI, ICPO, and the HSE NCPO worked with 70 specialists from across Ireland, to adapt the Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines, and published Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Obesity in Adults in Ireland in 2022. The Model of Care and the Irish CPGs recognise that weight bias and stigma have a profound effect on how care is delivered and experienced, and multiple studies have demonstrated the negative impact of weight bias on physical and mental health. In addition, a key principle of the NCPO is that weight-based stigma and discrimination will not be tolerated in the Irish healthcare system. Efforts to train health professional in obesity management have been facilitated through Irish participation in European training and masterclass events through EASO, clinical exchanges of staff between clinical centres of excellence across Europe (EASO COMs) and hosting the 2020 International and European Obesity Congress and the 2023 European Obesity Congress in Dublin. Training of health professional to manage child and adolescent obesity has improved with mandatory training added to two undergraduate medical curricula and online training completed by over 3000 health professionals across Ireland. Productive and effective networks have been established in Ireland over the last 10 years, across government, clinical, academic, and lived experience partners, demonstrating what can be achieved by working together. This is work that is now extending beyond Ireland as members of ICPO have been instrumental in working with the WHO on the Acceleration Plan to Stop Obesity and have spoken at several events focused on obesity and other NCDs in the European Parliament. By including obesity as a priority in its programme, the Irish Presidency can showcase the impressive work that has already been done in Ireland to address obesity and improve the lives of people living with obesity. Highlighting Ireland’s role as a leader in this area and sharing best practices with other EU countries can give a sense of ownership to and provide value to Irish citizens, ultimately showing the importance of leading the Presidency of the Council."

Both are essential to attract investment, accelerate innovation, and ensure timely patient access to transformative therapies. 1. Enhancing the European Intellectual Property System Intellectual property is the cornerstone of biopharmaceutical innovation, underpinning the high-risk, long-term investments required to bring new therapies to market. The EU’s IP framework, while robust, faces challenges from ongoing legislative reforms and global competition, notably from the US and Asia. The Irish Presidency should prioritise: Strengthening Regulatory Data Protection (RDP): The current RDP term is insufficient for therapies with limited patent protection or long development cycles, especially biologics. The EU should extend the baseline RDP term by two years and consider even longer protection for complex biologics, aligning with or surpassing the US standard. This will incentivise investment in breakthrough medicines and address unmet patient needs. Robust Patent Enforcement and Early Dispute Resolution: The EU would benefit from introducing mechanisms for early resolution of patent disputes, including a single public patent registry and requirements for generic/biosimilar manufacturers to assert their position on listed patents during marketing authorisation. This will provide legal clarity, reduce “launches at risk,” and balance timely market entry for generics with strong protection for innovators. 2. Modernising the Clinical Trials Ecosystem Clinical trials are the engine of evidence generation and patient access. However, regulatory fragmentation and operational inefficiencies undermine Europe’s competitiveness. The Irish Presidency should champion: A Harmonised, Product-Based Regulatory Model: Move towards a Core Dossier system, enabling sponsors to maintain a centralised product dossier referenced across multiple trials. This will reduce duplication, streamline approvals, and foster continuity of scientific knowledge. Centralised Ethics and Authorisation Processes: Establish a Single European Ethics Committee for clinical trials and empower the EMA to coordinate Clinical Trial Authorisation reviews. This will eliminate duplicative national requirements, accelerate trial start-up, and ensure uniform standards for patient safety and data protection. Digitalisation and Interoperability: Upgrade the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) with cloud-based architecture, real-time updates, and seamless integration with the European Health Data Space. Promote EU-wide recognition of electronic consent (e-consent) and interoperability of digital platforms to support innovative trial designs and cross-border research. Streamlined Timelines and Simplified Legislation: Shorten validation, assessment, and decision phases for trial approvals. Align overlapping regulations (GDPR, CTR, MDR/IVDR, AI Act) to reduce compliance complexity and operational delays. By focusing on the above policy areas, the Irish Presidency can help create a best-in-class environment for life sciences innovation, ensuring Europe remains competitive, resilient, and able to deliver cutting-edge therapies to patients. The Presidency should aim to deliver legislative progress on IP and clinical trials, foster regulatory harmonisation, and champion digital transformation across the sector. Finally, the presidency should work on providing clear and timely guidance on the use of AI in the life cycle of medicine as well as mobilizing private R&D investment in the EU and bolster the supporting environ"

One specific area where we urge attention is brain health. Despite extraordinary scientific progress in cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc, brain health remains one of the most under-prioritized global health challenges of our time — a quiet crisis that threatens not only individual wellbeing but societal progress. The Irish Presidency could help deliver this attention and the bold, coordinated action required. With this direction the Council could integrate brain health into national health strategies and global policy frameworks, improve health care systems, and ensure timely access to innovation. Starting a process that unlocks the promise for transformational science for brain health would be a powerful legacy."

These breakthroughs have transformed cancer care and may promise solutions for severe autoimmune diseases. Yet, regulatory fragmentation, and limited investment risk leaving Europe behind the US and Asia. Ireland’s Presidency offers a unique chance to position Europe as a leader in ATMPs. With world-class universities, clinical research centres, and a thriving biotech sector, Ireland can leverage its strengths in biomanufacturing and regulatory excellence to accelerate EU-wide adoption and scale of these transformative therapies. The Draghi report, commissioned to guide Europe’s competitiveness strategy, places special emphasis on ATMPs as a strategic priority. It states: “The pharmaceutical sector is recognised together with 9 other sectors as a strategic pillar where Europe needs to do more. … Europe is losing ground to other regions of the world, mostly China and the US, particularly in the areas of orphan drugs and advanced medicinal products.” The report further highlights: “The EU biotechnology and biomanufacturing sector has been recognised as one out of ten strategic technology sectors for Europe’s competitiveness, economic security, and sustainability; … the sector still faces regulatory and financial obstacles and an incomplete internal market; … the Commission is expected to present an EU Biotech Act.” It calls for: “Maximising the impact of the EU Health Data Space, streamlining the set-up and management of multi-country trials in the EU, expediting access to markets, and rapid and full implementation of the EU HTA Regulation.” The Draghi report also recommends: “Establishing an EU HTA agency in the long-term, improving business predictability through a continuous evidence-based dialogue with stakeholders, and increasing and focusing public R&D investment in the EU, through innovation hubs in life sciences.” The Irish Presidency should work on the following key topics to advance and unleash the ambition / potential of ATMPs 1. Value Recognition & Sustainable Reimbursement: ATMPs are often one-time treatments with curative potential, requiring payers to recognize their full value upfront. Europe’s HTA processes must adapt to reflect the long-term savings and societal benefits these therapies offer. As recommended under the Draghi report, a dedicated agency should coordinate joint clinical assessments and scientific consultations, ensuring high-quality outputs and appropriate involvement of all stakeholders. 2. Building the ATMP Ecosystem: Europe should promote high-quality, standardized production with EU accreditation for manufacturing. Large-scale, GMP-compliant production is essential for accessibility, while academic innovation should be supported for niche indications. Integrating robust Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) standards will ensure safety and efficacy at scale. 3. Regulatory Agility: Europe must adopt product-centric regulatory models, enable platform technology master files (PTMFs), and strengthen coordination between EMA, HTA bodies, and payers for joint evidence generation. A single European ethics review process for clinical trials and a “third pathway” for non-profit developers will reduce delays and fragmentation. 4. Public-Private Collaboration: Establish shared EU databases and annual “Advanced Therapy Horizon Forums” to align priorities and avoid duplication. Support innovation hubs that combine manufacturing, regulatory, and digital expertise. 5. Investment in Skills, Infrastructure, and Data: Create EU-wide certification for ATMP manufacturing personnel, invest in data interoperability, and integrate genomic and real-world evidence registries to support continuous learning and post-market monitoring. Conclusion: The Draghi report’s emphasis on ATMPs should guide the Irish Presidency to make advanced therapies a flagship priority. By embracing collaboration, investing boldly in innovation, and adapting regulatory frameworks, Europe can define the next decade of medical innovation and deliver life-changing treatments to patients across the continent."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
243,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a1214273/Macroom_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_243.docx,Macroom Biogas Concern Group,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
243,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a1214273/Macroom_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_243.docx,Macroom Biogas Concern Group,,,,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri-investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry-specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

In this context, the EU SHD Coalition recommends that Ireland adopt “Boosting Cardiovascular Health in Europe: Delivering the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan” as the high-level thematic focus of its 2026 Presidency. This would align closely with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 and demonstrate visible benefits of EU cooperation for citizens. Ireland can play a central role in promoting a shift towards earlier prevention and detection of cardiovascular diseases across the Union, especially of Structural Heart Disease (SHD). Structural Heart Disease refers to a range of abnormalities of the heart’s valves and chambers, including aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. It disproportionately affects older adults and often remains silent until advanced stages. Across Europe, SHD affects an estimated 14 million people, yet more than half of cases go undiagnosed, contributing significantly to avoidable hospitalisations, disability, and premature mortality. By advancing implementation of the EU flagship initiative “EU Cares for Your Heart,” the Presidency could support Member States in developing national CVH strategies by 2027 and help accelerate the rollout of the EU Protocol on Health Checks for Cardiovascular Diseases. This Protocol, including routine cardiac auscultation and tailored screening approaches based on age, gender, and geographical needs, will be essential for improving timely diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and structural heart disease. It will also be instrumental in achieving the EU-level target of reducing cardiovascular mortality by 20% by 2035. Ireland should also highlight the importance of strengthening cardiovascular treatment, including for SHD, and care pathways. The creation of the European Network of Cardiovascular Health Centres foreseen in the CVH Plan represents a major opportunity to reduce inequalities in access to high-quality diagnosis, intervention, rehabilitation, and long-term management. The Presidency can support early discussions on how to establish and operationalise this network so that expertise is shared efficiently and patients benefit from consistently high standards of care regardless of where they live. Finally, the Presidency can reinforce the EU’s commitment to innovation, digital health and workforce capacity. Strengthening primary care skills, including clinical auscultation and the use of digital diagnostic aids, will be crucial for early detection. Nevertheless, to ensure meaningful progress, the Presidency should above all emphasise the need for sufficient EU and national budget allocations dedicated to implementing the CVH Plan’s flagship initiatives, following the example of the EU’s Beating Cancer plan. By emphasising prevention, equitable access, treatment excellence, innovation, and workforce capability, the Irish Presidency can deliver a future-oriented vision that directly improves the health and wellbeing of EU citizens."

This Protocol will provide a shared, evidence-based framework for Member States to deliver high-quality, accessible cardiovascular health checks. Ireland can play a vital role by facilitating early Council discussions and encouraging agreement on key components such as routine cardiac auscultation, age- and gender-tailored screening approaches, incentives to improve participation, and mechanisms to support mobile outreach programmes. These elements will be crucial for improving detection of structural heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity, thereby reducing long-term health burdens and inequalities. The Presidency should also give prominence to the establishment of the European Network of Cardiovascular Health Centres. This new network will help ensure that advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities are available across the EU, supporting more equal access to care and enabling patients to benefit from shared expertise. Ireland can support discussions on criteria, governance, accreditation, and pathways for integration with national health systems, ensuring clinical excellence and consistent standards of care. This will be essential for translating the CVH Plan into real improvements in diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term disease management. Ireland will additionally have an important role in supporting innovation and digital transformation in cardiovascular health. As the Commission prepares to introduce a breakthrough regulatory pathway for cardiovascular medical devices within the MDR revision, the Presidency can facilitate constructive dialogue among Member States to ensure timely and effective adoption of innovative technologies. The Presidency can further encourage progress on the deployment of AI tools in clinical settings, the development of a blueprint for cardiovascular AI, and the increased use of real-world evidence to support clinical and policy decision-making. Ensuring interoperability and the alignment of cardiovascular indicators with the European Health Data Space will also be crucial for monitoring progress and supporting Member States. Finally, Ireland can guide discussions on how Member States will develop national cardiovascular health strategies by 2027, with sufficient dedicated budget allocations. These strategies will form the backbone of CVH Plan implementation and will need to incorporate prevention, screening, early diagnosis, referral pathways, treatment access, rehabilitation, and the reduction of health inequalities. The development of a cardiovascular health inequalities dashboard, foreseen in the CVH Plan, will be essential for monitoring progress. By supporting Member States in these areas, the Presidency can help ensure that the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan moves rapidly from vision to practical action and could also highlight how progress in implementing the EU CVH Plan will reinforce national health objectives, strengthening links between EU-level action and domestic outcomes."

Improved prevention and early detection of cardiovascular disease, including structural heart disease, will reduce avoidable mortality and disability and help ensure that people live longer, healthier and more active lives. Earlier diagnosis through routine health checks, including cardiac auscultation, will lead to timely treatment, fewer complications, and better long-term outcomes. These improvements are especially relevant for older people and women, who are disproportionately affected by underdiagnosed cardiovascular conditions. Health systems across the EU would also benefit substantially. It has been proven that earlier detection and treatment reduce the burden on hospitals, emergency services, and long-term care by decreasing the need for complex interventions and advanced-stage treatments. This contributes to greater system resilience, efficiency and sustainability. The Commission’s proposals for mobile screening outreach and the creation of the European Network of Cardiovascular Health Centres will support more equitable access to care and reduce regional disparities, ensuring that rural, remote, or underserved populations benefit from the same high standards as those in major urban centres. Given that Ireland itself faces similar demographic challenges, improvements in early detection and referral pathways under the EU CVH Plan would support better outcomes nationally while reducing pressures on Irish hospitals. Moreover, communities stand to gain through improved healthy ageing and reduced social and economic pressures associated with chronic cardiovascular disease. Healthier citizens participate more fully in society, are able to remain active for longer, and have greater opportunities for employment and community involvement. By reducing inequalities linked to age, gender, socio-economic status or geography, the Irish Presidency can help strengthen social cohesion and improve overall quality of life across the EU. The Presidency’s support for innovation and digital transformation would also positively impact European businesses and the wider economy. Establishing a breakthrough regulatory pathway for cardiovascular medical devices will boost EU competitiveness and stimulate investment in research, development and manufacturing. Promoting the integration of AI tools, real-world evidence and digital diagnostics into clinical practice will support Europe’s position as a global leader in health innovation and technology. These processes will strengthen collaboration between the public and private sectors and drive economic growth in high-value industries. Through the implementation of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan, the Irish Presidency can deliver visible, meaningful progress at a scale that citizens and communities will feel directly.

By emphasising consistent standards across Member States, such as those in the forthcoming EU Protocol on Health Checks, citizens can clearly see how EU action leads to earlier diagnosis and better access to care. The Presidency can also underline how these developments will directly improve cardiovascular outcomes in Ireland, contributing to national efforts to address heart disease and reduce health inequalities. Communicating the creation of the European Network of Cardiovascular Health Centres offers another strong pathway. Citizens, and especially patients, will be able to appreciate how EU collaboration ensures the availability of high-quality, specialist cardiovascular services regardless of where they live. This demonstrates the practical value of EU solidarity and the benefits of shared expertise. Highlighting success stories from clinicians, patients and researchers can further reinforce public trust and engagement, showing real-life examples of the lifesaving impact of early detection, guideline-consistent care pathways, rehabilitation and innovative technologies.

With its strong record in public health and cardiovascular care, Ireland is well positioned to lead early implementation and foster genuine progress. Stronger budgetary commitments, following the example of the EU’s Beating Cancer plan, at both EU and national levels, will be essential to ensure the successful rollout of the Health Check Protocol, the cardiovascular centres of excellence and the broader CVH Plan initiatives. Structural heart disease is explicitly recognised within the 2024 Council Conclusions on Cardiovascular Health and is expected to be present also in the EU CVH Plan, reflecting growing awareness of the need for earlier detection and more consistent access to treatment. Routine cardiac auscultation within the EU Protocol on Health Checks will be essential in identifying undiagnosed SHD and other cardiovascular disorders, which cannot be prevented through a healthy lifestyle, at an early stage. Ireland, by advancing these initiatives during its Presidency, can also strengthen its own national cardiovascular strategy, improving SHD and CVH outcomes for Irish citizens.

Ireland could work to strengthen EU and global partnerships that share research, technology, and best practices for clean energy. Ireland should advocate for public awareness campaigns across the EU about sustainable living and climate resilience. With persistent efforts we can achieve cleaner air, job creation in green sectors, and reduced vulnerability to energy price shocks. Ireland should also prioritize promoting peace throughout the world, especially in the conflicts going on in Palestine and Ukraine, along with the many conflicts and genocides going on in African countries such as Sudan. Ireland should review foreign aid to protect countries that need aid in developing, and especially those countries that will suffer from climate related issues. Ireland’s aid should reflect compassion and a sense of shared global responsibility. Ireland has a strong reputation for overseas aid and can continue to lead by example within the EU."

Investing in more public transport routes, higher energy efficient transport such as electric busses, and improving punctuality and convenience to incentivize the use of public transport, many people need to travel to work, school, or personal reasons, so improvements in public transport would take many cars off the road. Investment in energy sources such as wind or solar energy will improve energy prices and lower emissions, along with the investments in energy we also need to invest in grid infrastructure and storage. To promote peace and provide aid to countries in conflict Ireland, leading the Council should commit to a long-term reconstruction plans to rebuild and fund schools, hospitals, and housing. The EU needs to prioritize international law in the response to the genocide in Gaza to maintain moral credibility, continual aid to Gaza to alleviate pressure on Gazans, and a plan needs to be made for when the violence ends, while pushing for an end to any occupation in Gaza."

By betting on long-term fixes instead of divisions, plus standing strong together, Dublin might change how Brussels operates in ways people feel - giving real wins to citizens, businesses, even local communities across the area. Even though weather changes remain a serious issue now, they also open real opportunities. Should Ireland step up, it might speed up Europe’s shift to clean energy - driving funding into offshore turbines, solar setups, or new tech that creates jobs, lowers power costs, while ditching fossil fuels. Folks teaming up tends to kickstart new thinking; when we look after the environment, everyone gains - big companies included, yet local communities and small businesses also get a lift, nudging progress forward little by little. Breathing cleaner air along with having clean water improves well-being, creates steady work, all while giving Europe better footing ahead. Irelands got a rep for backing folks when times get rough, yet pitching in to keep things peaceful. Because it’s done this before, some countries might open up more - perhaps even joining forces on hot issues such as Ukraine or Palestine. Supporting aid missions, urging dialogue over conflict, yet standing firm on liberty and justice - this strengthens the EU’s goal of global peace. These actions help people facing tough situations; at the same time, they create more stable surroundings in Europe, lowering threats for nearby areas. Fostering global connection as nations progress side by side - while ensuring shifts unfold gradually Ireland might play a role in helping Europe voice things more evenly worldwide. Nations struggling from climate changes count on strong partnerships to influence future outcomes. Because of help with steady growth - linked to good schools, improved health centers, or swifter aid during crises - the EU might speed up change in these countries while quietly supporting global stability. Viewed this way - not out of duty, yet because it benefits everyone - it reveals what Europe truly means: creating shared understanding so we can tackle major issues together. Ireland steering the Council isn't just about choices - it's watching closely, stirring cooperation across countries, maybe even building global ties. Ireland might nudge Europe’s path in actual ways - say by changing how homes tap into energy, stopping disputes from flaring up, or forging global links - if it zeroes in on slashing emissions, calming clashes, or connecting countries. If we clock hours at work bringing people together around shared goals, Ireland might help shape a quieter, greener Europe - brighter and full of hope - where humans matter most while compassion shapes worldwide choices."

This is not a healthy state of society; it is not healthy to have a society where people do not involve themselves in the running of the country, this leaves all the decisions to a privileged few, which is not truly democratic. But if we look at our own local governments, we see a lot more involvement in events and campaigns involving local councilors because they know how to reach their local community, local councilors know what the people care about, and centres their campaigning messaging around that.

Leadership on this theme, as an ‘Irish Presidency for Children’ would be fitting, and the government could work collaboratively with partners, experts, civil society and children and young people to make a real and lasting difference in Ireland and other Member States."
78,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e5ea42a2/Early_Childhood_Ireland_-_Submission_78.docx,Early Childhood Ireland,,,,2,"Measures which will achieve the alleviation of child poverty and exclusion in the European Union by an agreed date and any necessary proposals to support these are critical. The Irish government could use the Presidency to develop an agreed multi-annual, shared roadmap. Given the variation in the rates of poverty and exclusion across Member States, what is working or has worked to address and solve poverty and exclusion in some countries, can be shared and adapted for local contexts where necessary. There is a wealth of evidence and expertise available in Ireland and beyond to develop impactful proposals. It is important that a holistic approach is taken which looks at all aspects of children’s lives, as well as at specific groups of children who are more vulnerable to poverty and exclusion, across the EU. To secure Council conclusions reinforcing child poverty eradication as a cross-cutting EU priority and accelerating legislative progress on social rights, the Irish Presidency should ensure that: The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) prioritises the implementation of the European Child Guarantee, ensuring Member States deliver concrete measures for children in poverty. The Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council (EYCS): support initiatives for equitable access to Early Years provision. The Environment Council (ENVI): embeds child-focused impact assessments in climate legislation."

The impact on those young lives is well documented, but child poverty is also expensive for communities and societies, while being avoidable, if sustainable solutions are implemented. Achieving an EU-led and shared plan to end child poverty during the Irish Presidency will achieve a longterm impact for individuals, communities and businesses in every Member State. For Children and Families: Reduce poverty rates through targeted EU funding and social protection measures. For Communities: Strengthen resilience by investing in child-centered services and inclusive education. For Businesses: Promote family-friendly policies and inclusive skills development for future generations. These actions would be enhanced by integrating child poverty and well-being impact assessments into any economic and social policy frameworks which are developed or progressed during the Presidency."

In this context, it is suggested that Ireland could act as a bridge-builder among Member States, industry and the citizenry by focusing on three mutually reinforcing priorities: (1) a clean industrial strategy centered on strategic net-zero technologies, (2) electrification and grid modernisation as core infrastructure, and (3) a socially just and regionally fair transition. The Irish Presidency will coincide with important negotiations on the EU’s next MFF budget (2028–2034), which will determine how Europe funds the Clean Industrial Deal, how it strengthens competitiveness and how it invests in critical energy infrastructure. The Commission’s Clean Industrial Deal, proposed in February 2025, would earmark over €100 billion to support industrial decarbonisation and competitiveness, while the newly proposed €400 billion European Competitiveness Fund aims to modernise grids, scale clean technologies and link these investments to cohesion policy. We believe that Ireland’s Presidency could be central to shaping how these instruments are embedded within the next MFF and how they interact with national and regional investment plans. Below are four high level themes which we suggest for consideration during the Presidency preparations: Electrification and grids: The Irish Presidency could frame regulatory reform and investment of electrification as a cross-cutting priority. Using the full MFF Toolbox & National and Regional Partnership Plans: This could be embedded across the European Competitiveness Fund, Connecting Europe Facility and Horizon Europe. In doing so the Irish Presidency could help address the EU-wide bottleneck of grid infrastructure. This issue is linked to the development of EU wide manufacturing, the emergence of advanced technologies, and new data capabilities, all of which will drive up electricity consumption. Shared Infrastructure Challenges: This agenda could also create opportunities for coalition-building among both larger and smaller Member States, for whom these issues are a common concern. An efficiency-first approach to public finance should guide resource allocation. It should prioritise guarantees and competitive mechanisms over direct subsidies for deploying mature technologies. Unlocking Energy Investment: Public funding could be directed towards emerging technologies such as heat pumps, long-term energy storage, and batteries. These emerging technologies require capital support, while solar, wind, and electric vehicles are already attracting private investment. The main aim of this policy approach is to balance limited fiscal resources while maximising private sector investment and engagement within the market. However, social safeguards and just transition measures must also be put in place. These should be reflected across the MFF architecture. The Irish Presidency could therefore champion stronger social protections for workers and vulnerable households, which would align with existing transition-fund frameworks and help address legitimate concerns about distributional impacts."
346,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2b937abb/The_Institute_of_International__European_Affairs_-_Submission_346.docx,The Institute of International & European Affairs,NGO / Registered Charity,Independent policy research,National and EU Wide,2,"The Irish Presidency comes at a key juncture in the MFF negotiations. We suggest that the Presidency could consider focusing work on four key interconnected legislative and policy domains which cut across the MFF negotiations. Each of these is set out below, with an indication of what success in this area could look like: The European Competitiveness Fund Governance: The Presidency could work towards the adoption of merit-based allocation procedures, in which strategic technologies (such as those based within the Net Zero Industry Act) are identified on an objective criteria, rather than allowing geographical distribution to take precedence. To achieve this, an early priority could be the design of a transparent methodology that prevents incumbent industries from capturing funding decisions. A neutral, evidence-based methodology would also support the advancement of the “Made in EU” criteria, ensuring that funding genuinely builds EU technological and industrial capacity rather than reinforcing legacy actors. Delivering on these criteria will require sustained investment in an EU-wide technology culture, the development of stronger value-added manufacturing capabilities, and procurement rules that maintain market discipline while incentivising innovation. Grid Infrastructure and Renewables Integration: The Irish Presidency could also work to operationalise and increase the Connecting Europe Facility’s Energy Programme through national and regional partnership plans. In implementing this, it would need to support reform of renewable-energy legislation, with measures that can be transposed into Member State plans. This could be aligned with post-COVID recovery precedents. The Irish Presidency could work to build partnerships to help the EU achieve agreement on standardised grid integration requirements across all Member States. Climate Mainstreaming and Horizon Europe Protection: The Presidency could work towards protecting the 35% climate mainstreaming target within the MFF and across different financial instruments, in response to possible downward pressure from other parties during MFF negotiations. In conjunction with this, it could aim to safeguard Horizon Europe’s proposed €175 billion research budget from competing emerging priorities. The presidency could frame research investment as essential to develop the necessary infrastructure to compete against competitors such as China, the USA and South Korea. Balancing Cohesion with Competitiveness: The presidency could aim to broker compromises between Member States with the aim of balancing geographic distribution with an exploration of how merit-based allocation could work at a regional level. Possible solutions could include allocating a percentage of national partnership planned funding through a competitive led-market mechanism, while also offering a mechanism that supports regional/national funding for clearly defined, interconnected initiatives. There is an opportunity to establish strong governance and coordination mechanisms to ensure the new European Competitiveness Fund works strategically with the Connecting Europe Facility and with Member States’ national investment plans. The aim of this would be to prevent any form of policy or strategic fragmentation."
346,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2b937abb/The_Institute_of_International__European_Affairs_-_Submission_346.docx,The Institute of International & European Affairs,NGO / Registered Charity,Independent policy research,National and EU Wide,3,"In order to achieve this, and in the context of the proposals submitted here, the work of the Council during the Irish Presidency could focus on the principles of efficiency-first, appropriate prioritisation and rapid deployment. These principles are explored below and presented within the context of the relationship between citizens, communities, and EU-based business. Each point unpacks options or mechanisms that could be made available and brought into play Communities and EU Citizens: Electrification and grid modernisation will directly improve citizens' energy security and help reduce costs to citizens on the demand side of deployment mechanisms. The goal must be to ensure that funding can reach households to improve their ability to achieve energy efficiency, such as through heat pumps and renewable heating delivered via accessible instruments that could include guarantees for retail banking partnerships. When this is widened to small communities, it could also be supported by improving grid infrastructure and expanding local renewable generation. By embedding just transition measures into such projects, the Presidency agenda has the opportunity to support those who work in carbon-intensive sectors through retraining, social supports, and economic diversification programmes. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Returning to efficiency-first financial principles could support and prioritise SMEs over larger corporations, especially in light of the ongoing private capital investment shortages in the EU. The Presidency could link this to the Competitiveness Fund and Member State partnership plans to include a dedicated SME window with more streamlined processes. The large-scale deployment of renewables and energy efficiency can create commercial opportunities across the supply chain. However, initiatives like this depend on grid modernization within the bloc. EU Industry: The Presidency could work on an evidence-based technological priority list which could provide strategic clarity for EU wide industrial investment strategy and planning. This could link with the “Made in EU” criteria and aim to protect EU manufacturing from underpriced imports, while at the same time creating and developing lead markets for emerging sectors. This would require coherent signals across research (Horizon Europe), development (Competitiveness Fund), and deployment (Infrastructure) to reduce market uncertainty and enable the private investment needed for the scaling of these markets. Implementation Mechanisms: Where feasible and appropriate, civil society actors and other stakeholders could have greater and more systematic involvement in high-level meetings, such as the informal Energy Councils, in order to ensure that a diversity of views are represented. Furthermore, the Presidency could publish a ‘pipeline’ of priority projects, including grid upgrades, renewables, and building renovation. The purpose of this pipeline would be to ensure that MFF funding is used steadily throughout its financial cycle, rather than being disbursed in the final months of its cycle through emergency procedures."

As such, the Presidency could frame the MFF priorities around clear outcomes such as cheaper and cleaner energy through grid modernisation and electrification; job creation in renewable energy, manufacturing and retrofitting; and a clear vision for energy independence in the EU. Such investments could also help to address the current cost-of-living pressures facing EU citizens and communities. Thus, this headline theme for the Irish Presidency could be framed as developing pragmatic solutions to serve both business and households in the EU. The Irish Presidency could furthermore promote itself as a bridge-builder among member states and between the citizenry, private and public institutions, to reflect Ireland’s consensus building approach and its reputation as an ‘honest broker’. This would complement an approach that recognises that realising our climate ambitions does not need to come at the expense of European competitiveness, nor at the expense of other policy areas which have, as a result of geopolitical tensions, come to be seen as higher priority in recent times."

Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. • Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. • More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizencentred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. • Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. This people-centred framing will strengthen public trust, build ownership, and demonstrate the concrete value of Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

Both the Draghi and Letta reports highlighted the need for the EU to strengthen its global competitiveness and the internal market. In addressing these challenges, policymakers must recognise that robust and vibrant levels of competition between businesses are essential to ensuring competitiveness. However, recent debates on competitiveness have included calls for competition policy to be used to support the creation of “European champions”. The argument suggests that if the EU is to compete with the US or China, certain European firms should be allowed to build the scale and resources to do so, irrespective of the impact on competitive dynamics in markets. Yet if companies cannot compete effectively to achieve scale in their home markets, how they can hope to succeed globally? Firms aiming compete internationally, must first successfully compete at home, including within the European market. In December 2025, the CCPC published its State of Competition in Ireland report on the non-financial services sector. The report found that market concentration has been increasing in the Irish services sector, resulting in certain industries in which businesses hold increased market power. In examining conditions for competition in the services sector, the CCPC found that businesses reported a number of barriers to expansion in their existing market or into new ones. These barriers included the inability to source skilled staff, difficulties in securing financing, and the global economic environment. The completion of the Single Market will be essential in strengthening the competitiveness of the EU economy. There are many policy and legislative initiatives under the Single Market Strategy, the Savings and Investment Union, and the Competitiveness Compass which will contribute to deepening the single market. These measures aim to provide more opportunities for businesses to grow, improving access to financing for investment and growth, and driving simplification to make it easier to do business across the Union, while also ensuring a high standard of consumer protection. Ireland’s Presidency will play a vital role in driving forward the implementation of many of those initiatives."

The 2030 Consumer Agenda, adopted in November 2025, sets out measures in 4 keys areas: Enabling consumers to leverage the benefits of the Single Market. Ensuring digital fairness and protecting consumers, particularly children, online. Enabling sustainable consumption and protecting consumers from greenwashing, and Effective enforcement and redress to protect consumers and shield compliant businesses from unfair competition, Two major proposals in this area, the Digital Fairness Act (DFA) and the revised Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation are expected in Q4 2026. The CCPC considers that stronger consumer protection online and strengthened enforcement are key priorities for the Single Market and Ireland. The CCPC supports the DFA’s aim to tackle harmful practices such as dark patterns, addictive design, unfair personalised pricing, and subscription traps. A central principle we have advocated is “easy in, easy out” for digital contracts: consumers should be able to cancel subscriptions or withdraw from contracts as easily as they sign up. This is critical to restoring trust in digital markets and empowering consumers to make informed choices. The Presidency should champion this principle and ensure robust, practical measures to support consumer decision-making online, alongside clear obligations for traders and effective enforcement mechanisms. Ireland should also take proactive positions on related reviews, including the Digital Fitness Check, proposed amendments to Regulation 1/2003, and the review of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), all scheduled to progress during Ireland’s term. These initiatives will help maintain competitive markets and safeguard consumer interests in an evolving digital economy. Better Regulation The Irish presidency should prioritise progressing plans for major simplification of regulation in 2026. Simplification must not mean deregulation. The Irish Presidency should ensure that, while advancing the simplification agenda, the interests of EU citizens and businesses are protected alongside competitiveness. Key priorities include the 28th regime which will set harmonised rules for innovative companies throughout the EU, with a legislative proposal expected in Q1 2026. Furthermore, the Commission’s 2026 work programme commits to cutting administrative burdens for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by 35% without lowering standards. These initiatives will enhance competitiveness, support start-ups and scale-ups, and align with Ireland’s growth priorities. The CCPC considers that the Irish presidency should support the advancement of these measures and other related proposals. Additionally, in the area of digital, the Digital Omnibus Regulation, proposed by the European Commission in November 2025, seeks to simplify existing rules on Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, and data. With Ireland hosting leading companies in these sectors, the Presidency should prioritise advancing this proposal to achieve the right balance between competitiveness and robust protections for citizens. Public Procurement Finally, the Presidency should prioritise advancing revisions to the EU public procurement Directives. Public procurement is central to the Single Market, promoting competitive markets and safeguarding the public interest. However, recent studies have raised concerns about competitiveness in procurement across the EU. The Commission’s 2024–2029 political guidelines announced a revision of the Directives, and its 2026 Work Programme includes a Public Procurement Act proposal planned for Q2 2026. At national level, a new Public Procurement Strategy for Ireland is being developed to update policy areas and address added complexity in procurement practices."

New challenges are emerging which pose a threat to children’s rights: rising poverty and housing instability the impact of climate change on children; online safety and AI; changes to migration laws and policies that impact children on the move; mental health; and the impact of armed conflicts on children. It is critical that children’s rights become part of the highest political agenda of the EU and are made integral to the Irish Presidency with the participation of children and young people at its centre. The start of the Irish Presidency will culminate with the 20th anniversary of the EU Commission’s Communication Towards an EU strategy on the rights of the child. At the time, the ambition was for the Union to be a “beacon to the rest of the world” when it came to children’s rights. This proposal led to the launch of the Strategy on Children’s Rights and the European Child Guarantee in 2021. Both initiatives were guided and took fully into account the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the UNCRC). The EU Strategy explicitly provides that the UNCRC, which all EU Member States (MS) have ratified, continues to guide the EU’s action in the field of children’s rights. It recognises that more than 30 years after its entry into force, significant progress has been made and children are increasingly recognised as having their own set of rights. However, further action is needed to advance the full implementation of the UNCRC at EU level. The Irish Presidency should emphasise the importance of upholding the UNCRC in all EU actions internal and external, and consider initiating a conversation in Ireland about the full and direct incorporation of the Convention into domestic law. This thematic area cuts across the EU’s priorities for 2024-2029: A strong Europe that safeguards the rights of the most vulnerable: the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum (the EU Pact) will start being implemented during the Irish Presidency with significant impacts on the rights of children on the move. The Irish Presidency’s focus and contribution in the area of migration should be to ensure that the respect for human rights guide and inform the implementation of the EU Pact. The European Commission (EC) recognises that migrant and refugee children are in a state of particular vulnerability and require specific and appropriate protection and this should be a key focus. A Europe that upholds human rights and the rule of law: in an era of power politics and uncertainty, there is growing evidence that international law and the international order are under attack. The Irish Presidency has the opportunity and the responsibility to ensure that Europe leads by example in upholding international law, especially international human rights law, including the UNCRC, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the EU’s own Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFREU) in its policies and actions, both internally and externally. A responsible Europe that assesses the impact of artificial Intelligence (AI) and provides robust regulation: The OCO has put a spotlight on the children’s rights implications of AI, which should be taken under advisement by the Irish Presidency in the forthcoming EU initiatives on AI. The new EU AI Act refers to children’s rights, and the EU Digital Services Act sets out obligations for online service providers, including high privacy, safety and security standards for children. However, a discussion is needed on how we can implement more robust regulation, and stronger enforcement within a children’s rights framework."

It is a cross-cutting dimension of all legislative acts and an aspect which will need to be operationalised in each of the other building blocks. The EC is very clear: “There can be no picking and choosing. All building blocks need to be implemented and are interdependent.” The EU Pact sets out important safeguards and rights for applicants for international protection and people with specific needs, particularly children and families with children. The implementation of these fundamental rights and safeguards serves to protect human dignity and ensure a genuine and effective right to asylum, including for the most vulnerable, as well as the access to effective remedies in line with the EU Charter, the ECHR and the UNCRC. The Irish Presidency must ensure that the implementation of the EU Pact complies with human rights standards as required by the Pact and international human rights law. Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities The Irish Presidency must ensure that the review of the Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will include provisions and measures that guarantee children with disabilities are seen, heard and counted. Children with disabilities must be an integral part of the updated Strategy, they must be actively involved in the consultation process and the Strategy should require that data on their experiences is collected and disaggregated by disability. Children with disabilities are subjects of rights under both the UNCRC and UNCRPD, and the Irish Presidency should ensure that this is reflected in the new strategy. Anti-poverty strategy The Irish Presidency must ensure that the EU's first Anti-Poverty Strategy will tackle child poverty as a priority and will be informed by the voices of those with lived experience of poverty. The European Child Guarantee should be strengthened and integrated in the Strategy. Special attention should be dedicated to particularly vulnerable groups of children, including migrant children, Roma children, children with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ children, children in alternative care, and homeless children who are disproportionately affected by poverty, in addition to the intersection with other forms of human rights violations and discrimination. Online safety and artificial intelligence (AI) An OCO Survey on Extremism, Discrimination and Gender Roles revealed that there is a clear link between the online world and the prevalence of extremist views particularly for boys and young men. This is also a reality in other MS of the EU. With the growth of the AI landscape, the EU must ensure that regulators hold social media companies to account and include a special focus on children in its work on AI to ensure that children are protected from harm. Up until now the focus on children and children’s rights in relation to AI has been marginal at best. This must be addressed to ensure children are safe online and that they are not being targeted through harmful algorithms. The Irish Presidency must ensure that children’s rights have a special focus in regulatory work around AI."

Children’s rights are an integral part of EU values as provided in Article 24 CFREU. The EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child commits to strengthen the mainstreaming of children’s rights across all relevant EU actions with the specific needs of certain groups of children, including those in situations of multiple vulnerabilities and facing intersecting forms of discrimination, being duly taken into account. For this to happen, the Council must take children’s rights seriously in its work and ensure that child rights impact assessments (CRIAs) are part and parcel of EU policy/legislation making in areas such as migration, poverty, disability, online safety and AI. The Council should also consider a review of the current EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child 2021-2024 and ensure that a mainstreaming checklist on the rights of the child, promised by the EC in 2021 but never delivered, is developed with the involvement of civil society and children."

The EU is built on fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union provides that “The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.” The EU Charter of fundamental rights applies in conjunction with national and international fundamental rights protection systems, including the European Convention on Human Rights. The scope of application of the Charter reflects the scope of EU law itself: “the Charter is the ‘shadow’ of EU law. This means, in essence, that there can be no situation that is governed by EU law in which the Charter does not apply.” The Irish Presidency must ensure that EU actions abide by the Charter and international human rights law at all times and in all areas, especially at a time when a total disregard for human rights is being openly displayed by major players. The best way for the Irish Presidency to create a sense of ownership: To foster participation of its citizens, including children in EU policy making. There is no better way of creating a sense of ownership than involving people in decision making processes. The EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child commits to child participation and creates an EU Children Participation Platform, however, participation must be understood as going beyond consultation. For participation to be meaningful and produce a sense of ownership, children’s views must be taken seriously and given due weight, which means they must be able to influence an outcome, or a decision. The Irish Presidency should implement child participation in EU policy making in line with the guidance from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child as required by Article 24 of the CFREU."

Nearly half (45%) of the EU population provides unpaid care. Unpaid carers provide in excess of 80% of care across the EU. In many EU countries, family carers face even greater challenges in securing recognition and supports than some of their Irish counterparts. The 2022 European Care Strategy is a key document, and this Presidency has the opportunity to move it forward. Historically, and continuing today, Irish MEP’s have been key supports for, and drivers in, developing a formal EU Agenda for Care (including Frances Fitzgerald, Marian Harkin and Luke Ming Flanagan). We understand that the EU Commission is also intending to come forward with a ‘Care Deal’. This is also an opportunity at a carer focused event to showcase good examples of comprehensive Irish state funded support for family carers – in the area of income supports (Carers Allowance, Carers Benefit, Carer Support Grant, Pensions for Carers); direct face-to-face carer supports (e.g. Citizens Information, Family Carers Ireland, Dementia Advisors) and online carer support interventions (delivered by our own organisation, Care Alliance Ireland)."

Goal: Advance the effective implementation and monitoring of the Work-Life Balance Directive across all Member States, specifically concerning carer’s leave and flexible working arrangements. Specifically: o Prioritise work by Eurofound and the Commission to establish and monitor EU-wide qualitative and quantitative data on the living conditions and needs of informal/family carers. This data is critical for evidence-based policymaking, addressing the ""invisibility"" of the role and it complements the EU Monitoring Framework on the Council Recommendation on the access to affordable high-quality long-term care. o Drive discussions in the EPSCO on ways to ensure that informal carers are identified across the EU and that periods of registered, intensive informal care contribute to the carer's social security and pension entitlements, mitigating the long-term risk of poverty and the gender pension gap. Invest in Quality Care & Professionalisation A major theme of the European Care Strategy is improving the formal care sector to reduce the forced reliance on informal/family care. Goal: Facilitate agreement and commitments on sustainable funding for professional long-term care, making informal care a choice, not a necessity. Specifically: o Focus Council discussions on Member State National Action Plans to ensure guaranteed access to high-quality, affordable respite care (day care, temporary residential care, inhome support). Push for a shared best-practice framework for respite services. o Promote policies that ensure professional care staff are trained to cooperate with and support informal/family carers, formally recognising informal/family carers as ""cocreators"" of care who require support, counselling, and training themselves. o Promote the mental health and well-being of professional carers and informal/family carers. 3. Leverage Digitalisation in Care (linked to the competitiveness/single market) Digital solutions have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and quality of care, linking to the goal of a robust Digital Single Market. Goal: Promote the adoption of accessible, interoperable digital solutions to support informal care. Specifically: o Promote the existing EC/WHO online training for carers which includes country factsheets outlining the rights, support services (e.g., respite care), and financial benefits available to family carers in their specific country. o Fund initiatives across the EU that drive the adoption of online family carer peer-to-peer support interventions (using such interventions as delivered by Care Alliance Ireland as a possible template)"

Address Carers’ Economic Security and Competitiveness By linking the care agenda to the Presidency’s anticipated focus on Competitiveness and a robust Single Market, the work of the Council can directly support businesses and individual livelihoods. The Presidency should prioritise the effective monitoring and enforcement of the Work-Life Balance (WLB) Directive, particularly the provisions for Carer’s Leave, and encourage Member States and stakeholders to go beyond the legal requirements of the WLB Directive - for example by providing paid Carer Leave. The Council should advance discussions on how periods of registered intensive caregiving can be integrated into social security and pension systems at the EU level. This directly mitigates the risk of poverty, a substantial concern for both Care Alliance Ireland and for Eurocarers and its members, and helps women in particular remain economically active, thereby improving overall labour market participation. Enhance Data and Recognition of the Carer Role to Unlock Support The Presidency can champion a common framework, building on the Work-Life Balance Directive and the Care Strategy, for the early identification and assessment of carers’ needs across all member states. This requires political endorsement in the Council of the EU for a refined harmonised data collection methodology on informal care, complementing the EU monitoring Framework on the Council Recommendation on access to affordable high-quality long-term care. This evidence is crucial to inform policy, ensure support reaches those who need it, and make the 'invisible workforce' visible to policymakers. 3. Prioritise Implementation and Investment in Quality Care The most significant impact will come from ensuring that the Council Recommendation on Long-Term Care is not merely adopted, but actively implemented and triggers a change of approach to informal carer in policy making and societal representations. The Presidency must drive the translation of the Council Recommendation into concrete national action plans with dedicated funding under the European Semester process, and the next EU funding period. This includes facilitating ministerial agreement in the EPSCO to set common, ambitious quantitative targets for the provision of affordable, high-quality care – both formal and informal. By focusing on these three implementation-oriented areas, the Irish Presidency can make a profound and lasting positive impact on the health, financial stability, and societal inclusion of millions of EU citizens."

The strategy must be to make EU action directly relevant to the most profound challenges in people's daily lives. Focus on Tangible, Personal Impact Instead of abstract policy discussions, the Presidency should frame its work through the lens of intergenerational solidarity and gender equality, which are core EU values visible in care policy. Highlight how the EU, through the Work-Life Balance Directive and the European Care Strategy, provides tangible rights such as Carer’s Leave and financial protections that prevent poverty and contribute to pension entitlements for carers. Use real-life testimonials from carers across Ireland and Europe (e.g., in short videos or web articles) to demonstrate how these EU measures have allowed them to stay in the workforce or access essential respite services. This connects the EU Presidency’s agenda to personal empowerment. Involve Carers as Partners, Not Just Beneficiaries The Presidency should consider a means by which citizens can co-shape policy by hosting targeted ""Citizens’ Care Dialogues"" or high-profile public events that specifically invite Eurocarers and national carer organisations to share their expertise. Enable a clear communication stream that explains policy developments in simple terms and also enables citizens the chance to be heard. This should be framed so that citizens perceive themselves as co-producers of care and partners in policy implementation. This would demonstrate that Ireland’s role as the Presidency is about listening to and incorporating the lived experiences of vulnerable groups into EU policy. 3. Translate EU Policy into Local Benefit The communication must show the 'EU-to-Local' pathway, connecting Presidency decisions in Brussels to services in local communities. Launch a clear information campaign explaining how member states are investing in local, high-quality formal and informal care and digital support services. Utilise local media and community networks to host events showcasing EU-funded projects that improve care, demonstrating that the Presidency is focused on delivering a Europe that provides support and dignity for those who care, thereby strengthening the public perception of EU membership benefits."

The achievement of this goal is especially important now, as an increasing number of individuals and groups are critically challenging established democratic norms and values. This trend has contributed to the emergence of more extreme viewpoints that clearly lack an emphasis on the common good or collective solidarity. Most citizens’ needs are relatively simple: they require access to an adequate income that provides a home, heat, food, and clothing. As a minimum, these benchmarks should be used by the EU to assess whether it is effectively serving the interests of its citizens. If these goals aren't met, it's hard to foster value or ownership in people who believe their basic needs are being ignored.

Key focus areas include: Trade Defence and Fair Competition European manufacturers face mounting pressure from state-subsidized imports, particularly from China, which distort markets and threaten industrial viability. The Presidency should advance reforms to EU trade defence instruments, ensuring faster investigations, stronger anti-dumping measures, and effective enforcement of level-playing-field rules. This will safeguard Europe’s industrial base and prevent erosion of competitiveness. Regulatory Balance and Competitiveness Compliance costs linked to CBAM, the revised Machinery Directive, Ecodesign Regulation, and cybersecurity frameworks (NIS 2, Cyber Resilience Act) risk overburdening SMEs. The Presidency should champion a Competitiveness Check for all new legislation, ensuring sustainability and safety objectives are met without disproportionate cost impacts. Streamlined implementation guidelines and harmonized standards will reduce complexity and support innovation. Export Support and Market Diversification To enable firms to compete globally, Ireland should push for an EU-wide State-backed export credit insurance scheme, providing risk mitigation and financing for international expansion. Deepening the Single Market by removing barriers and enforcing existing rules will further enhance competitiveness. The Presidency should also prioritize WTO reform, strategic bilateral trade agreements, and frameworks for digital trade and data flows, embedding trade diversification and supply chain resilience into the EU’s Economic Security Strategy. Energy Affordability and Infrastructure High energy costs undermine industrial competitiveness. The Presidency should accelerate the Energy Highways initiative, cross-border interconnectors, and LNG storage investments to secure supply and stabilize prices. Streamlined permitting for renewables and hydrogen networks will advance decarbonization while reducing costs. A balanced approach—combining infrastructure investment with innovation partnerships—will strengthen Europe’s energy autonomy. Dual-Use Innovation Embedding dual-use strategies across the industrial base will unlock synergies between commercial and defence technologies, reducing R&D costs and accelerating innovation. The Presidency should align EU and national frameworks to facilitate funding and certification for dual-use applications in AI, robotics, sensors, and autonomous systems, reinforcing resilience and competitiveness. 6. Skills, Talent, and Inclusion Addressing the skills crisis is critical. Ireland should lead on the Union of Skills agenda, promoting consistent funding for apprenticeships, lifelong learning, and digital upskilling.

This will protect jobs, encourage innovation, and ensure businesses remain globally competitive without compromising sustainability goals. Strengthening Trade Defence and Fair Competition State-subsidized imports, particularly from China, distort markets and threaten EU manufacturing. The Presidency should prioritize modernizing trade defence instruments, accelerating anti-dumping investigations, and enforcing level-playing-field rules. These measures will safeguard Europe’s industrial base, secure employment, and maintain community prosperity. Expanding Market Access and Diversification To help businesses thrive globally, Ireland should advocate for: State-backed export credit insurance schemes to reduce risk for SMEs. Deepening the Single Market by removing barriers and enforcing existing rules. Advancing WTO reform, strategic bilateral trade agreements, and frameworks for digital trade and data flows. Embedding trade diversification and supply chain resilience into EU Economic Security Strategies will protect communities from external shocks and ensure long-term stability. Delivering Affordable and Secure Energy High energy costs undermine competitiveness and household budgets. The Presidency should accelerate the Energy Highways initiative, cross-border interconnectors, and LNG storage investments to stabilize prices and secure supply. Streamlined permitting for renewables and hydrogen networks will reduce reliance on fossil fuels, cut costs, and create green jobs benefiting both businesses and communities. Investing in Skills and Inclusion Addressing the skills crisis is vital for competitiveness and social cohesion. The Presidency should: Promote the Union of Skills agenda for lifelong learning and digital upskilling. Support consistent funding for apprenticeships and expand visa programs for engineering talent. Advance gender equality through childcare infrastructure, tax reforms, and targeted STEM initiatives. These measures will ensure the twin transition of green and digital and create opportunities rather than displacement, fostering inclusive growth across Europe. Outcome By focusing on competitiveness, fair trade, energy affordability, skills, and inclusion, the Irish Presidency can deliver tangible benefits: stronger businesses, secure jobs, and resilient communities. This agenda will position Europe as a global leader in sustainable industry while ensuring prosperity for its citizens."

By linking the Presidency’s priorities to real-world outcomes for people, businesses, and communities, Ireland can make the EU’s role visible, relevant, and inspiring. 1. Showcasing Economic Opportunity and Competitiveness Citizens often perceive EU policy as distant or overly technical. The Presidency should communicate how EU initiatives directly support jobs, innovation, and prosperity. For example: Global Trade Competitiveness: Explain how strengthening trade defence mechanisms protects European industries from unfair competition and secures employment in sectors like engineering and manufacturing. Market Access: Highlight efforts to secure new trade agreements and diversify supply chains, ensuring businesses can grow internationally and communities benefit from stable, affordable goods. Messaging should emphasize that these actions safeguard Europe’s industrial base and create opportunities for SMEs the backbone of local economies. Linking Energy Policy to Everyday Benefits Energy affordability and security resonate strongly with citizens. The Presidency should frame its leadership on the Energy Highways initiative, cross-border interconnectors, and renewable infrastructure as measures that: Lower household energy bills. Reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. Create green jobs in emerging sectors like offshore wind and hydrogen. Clear, relatable narratives such as “EU cooperation means cheaper, cleaner energy for Irish homes” will make EU action tangible. Human-Centered Communication on Skills and Inclusion The Union of Skills agenda and gender equality initiatives should be presented as investments in people: Explain how EU-backed apprenticeships and lifelong learning programs equip workers for highquality jobs in the green and digital economy. Showcase efforts to remove barriers for women in STEM and improve childcare infrastructure as steps toward a fairer, more inclusive Europe. Stories of individuals benefiting from these programs can personalize the message and build emotional connection. Use Accessible Language and Multiple Channels To create ownership, communication must move beyond technical jargon. Strategies include: Digital storytelling: Short videos and infographics showing how EU trade agreements open markets for Irish businesses or how energy projects cut costs. Community engagement: Town halls, school programs, and partnerships with local media to explain EU initiatives in practical terms. • Social media campaigns: Highlighting success stories under themes like “Ireland at the Heart of Europe’s Future.” 5. Emphasize Shared Values Finally, link policies to core EU values solidarity, sustainability, and security. Position Ireland’s Presidency as a driver of a competitive, inclusive, and resilient Europe that protects citizens’ interests globally. Outcome By connecting EU policies to everyday benefits, jobs, affordable energy, skills, and fairness, the Irish Presidency can transform abstract concepts into tangible value, fostering pride in EU membership and a sense of collective ownership."

As part of this area, a focus should be given to inequalities in health and healthcare leadership affecting women and minorities. Health is a fundamental human right and yet women and girls, and those from minority or traditionally underserved groups, have worse health outcomes, find it more difficult to access care and are under-represented in leadership and decision making. A key part of A Better World is advancing gender equality and health is a key part of this. Research by Women in Global Health shows that despite 70% of health workers worldwide being female, only 25% of those in leadership positions in health are women. Research also shows that women have poorer health outcomes, particularly those from minority backgrounds. We are also seeing a roll back of women’s rights and comprehensive SRHR world wide and within the EU bloc. All three pillars of the Council’s strategic agenda could be advanced by improving equity and inclusion in health. A healthy Europe is a strong and secure Europe. As we have seen with the Covid-19 pandemic, pandemics respect no borders. The reduction in funding for global health efforts globally are shortsighted, health security and equity is a front line defence. A free and democratic Europe cannot be achieved if there are inequities in sectors or within countries. The strategy highlights that values such as human dignity and the respect for human rights is the EU’s strength. Access to health for women and underserved communities is key to dignity and human rights. Prioritising this will build a strong, inclusive Europe. A key part of a prosperous and competitive Europe is health cooperation. Ireland should drive gender equity within health cooperation for a fair, equitable Europe. Europe’s technological and industry should be underpinned by increased research and investment in issues that impact women’s health, which has traditionally been underfunded. Creating good jobs and ensuring representation at leadership that goes beyond gender quotas but also sees representation from communities who are traditionally underrepresented is key to maximizing Europe’s prosperity. Ireland has long been a champion of the furthest behind at a global stage and are a respected voice at a European level. Ireland should champion gender equity in health as part of their Presidency, with a focus on the right to health which would position the government well for advancing their bid for a seat on the UN Human Right’s Council."

Ireland should propose a mechanism for monitoring gender equity and inclusion through all the programmes run by the EU but also legislating that EU Member States report on gender equity and inclusion annually with a chapter to include equity and inclusion in healthcare. Ireland should implement meaningful consultation mechanisms for all EU policies being renewed going forward. Women in all their diversity should be at the table when decisions are being made."

The new Multi-Annual Financial Framework is being developed and this brings with it opportunity to ember Ireland’s views of equity, inclusion and leaving no one behind in the negotiations. This will have substantial impact on people, businesses and communities across the EU. By advocating for gender equity and social inclusion as a core principle of EU funding, Ireland can ensure that advances across the EU are available to everyone. Without embedding inclusion and equity in funding from the outset, there is a risk that any advances made do not include those who are traditionally marginalized. Ireland should emphasise a rights-based investment in health, social protection and community resilience. When people’s human rights are being upheld, they are able to participate more in society driving economic stability and sustainability for business. For there to be a substantive positive impact on people, businesses and communities across the EU, these stakeholders need to be meaningfully consulted. Too often business voices are the loudest in these fora and there is a need to balance what is best for business with what is best for the population as a whole. Ireland should systematically involve civil society, with a particular focus on communities that are traditionally underrepresented such as ethnic and gender minorities, disability and carers organisations, in public policies to co-create, implement and monitor EU and national gender-equal policies and actions."

By using this framing, citizens of the EU will see their role within the EU and globally as key to safe, health, democratic societies. Ireland has long benefited from public support for the EU and the public has seen it’s self as part of a global community. This should be emphasized and can be fostered through showing how Ireland’s values of gender equity and rights can be advanced as part of the EU and how the bloc can complement the work being done at a national level. As outlined in Q3, meaningful consultation of communities is key. Where people can see their role in co-creating policies that impact them, there will be a sense of ownership and pride fostered.

While it can be tempting to respond to the challenges we confront in a reactive manner, we mustn’t abandon the principles and values on which our Union was founded, and which we strive to protect and promote on the international stage, in doing so. It is essential that we defend the erosion of the hard-fought freedoms and democratic rights that many of us have come to take for granted. At the very foundation of the European Union lies a robust commitment to democracy, in which European citizens are active and engaged participants. Civil society’s importance in the realisation of the values that underpin the foundations of the Union, as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), are recognised in Article 11 of the TEU, which states that the EU “shall maintain open, transparent and regular dialogue” with civil society, and separately Article 15 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which states that civil society participation shall be ensured through the operational transparency of the Union. This participation strengthens social cohesion, improves the quality and legitimacy of public decision-making, and builds a shared commitment to the principles of equality, inclusion, and accountability. At a time when polarisation, disinformation, declining institutional trust, and shrinking civic space threaten the resilience of our democracy, empowering people to engage meaningfully in public life is more important than ever, and will help to restore and reinforce its foundations. While the work of civil society becomes more essential, it has also become increasingly difficult, with civic space under assault in a growing number of countries - according to the 2025 CIVICUS Monitor, more than 70% of the world’s population live in severely constrained civic space, where freedom of association, expression and peaceful assembly are under threat. Ireland has historically had a strong tradition of civic engagement, community organising and human rights advocacy, but the role of the civic, community and voluntary sector has become underappreciated and contested, and. in some cases, undermined entirely, as observed in the exclusion of key civil society voices in the oversight processes informing the development of Ireland’s forthcoming National Drugs Strategy. Our proud tradition of civic engagement has made an indispensable contribution to a vibrant democracy in Ireland, but this positive legacy risks being undone if we do not preserve the space afforded to civil society, especially when expressing dissent informed by a significant depth of expertise. While we had the luxury of being somewhat protected from the erosion of civic and democratic participation observed in other jurisdictions, that is sadly no longer the reality. Ireland is now experiencing a contraction of civic space, from within and without, fueled by rising inequality, strategic disempowerment of our citizens, the curtailment of expression through intimidation, algorithmic misinformation and manipulation, and interference by mal-actors. This trend is mirrored across the EU, where civil society organisations (CSOs) have been significantly restricted in their ability to operate and organise in certain member states in recent years, as documented by Civil Society Europe. CSOs across the continent are finding it increasingly challenging to access stable public funding streams, whilst obstacles to fundraising through donations, cross-border philanthropy, or crowdfunding persist. This is an acute issue in Ireland, where concrete action is yet to be taken to address long-standing legal obstacles to funding for CSOs under our Electoral Acts. By including civil society engagement and democratic participation within the thematic priorities of Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, an opportunity is presented to reinforce Europe’s democratic values, respond proactively to shrinking civic space across our continent, strengthen the EU’s institutional dialogue with citizens and citizens’ organisations, and enhance democratic resilience in the face of significant sociopolitical and geopolitical challenges. Driving this agenda would leave a positive, lasting legacy in support of a more inclusive, participatory, and resilient Union, at a time when these values are coming under increasing pressure."
431,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/29524abf/Senator_Lynn_Ruane_-_Submission_431.docx,None,Independent Public Representative,Public Administration,National and EU wide,2,"A vibrant, protected, and well-supported civil society represents one of the EU’s strongest assets for sustaining a healthy democracy and countering the forces that weaken it and erode confidence in democratic institutions and processes. This was recognised in Ursula Von der Leyen’s candidacy for Commission Presidency, which called for citizens to be placed at the heart of European democracy, for participation to be embedded across the Union, for civil society to be better protected in its work, and for engagement between the Union and civil society to be “stepped up”. This commitment has been reflected in the EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, which aims to strengthen democratic resilience by protecting a “free and pluralistic” civil society in Europe. While it is one thing to recognise the central role played by civil society in a healthy democracy, there needs to be an acknowledgement that the dynamic between civil society and government is not purely collaborative, and at times must be robust and confrontational. Civil society’s independence is therefore critical, and the need for CSOs to be able to advocate, organise and campaign freely and without interference is absolute, even when dissenting from government policy. This tension is a fundamental ingredient of a healthy democracy. In 2024, Michael McGrath was appointed EU Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection - a hugely important brief at a critical juncture. As Commissioner, Mr McGrath is tasked with upholding and strengthening the values and principles that underpin the EU. Within this, he is charged with specific responsibility for implementing the EU’s new Democracy Package, made up of the European Democracy Shield and the EU’s first ever Strategy for Civil Society. Against this backdrop, Ireland’s Presidency offers a unique and timely opportunity to champion a renewed European commitment to civic participation and democratic resilience. Prioritising the protection of civic space and democratic participation as a high-level thematic focus would allow Ireland to: • reinforce and enhance the EU’s foundational democratic values; • prioritise a rights based approach to policy & legislative developement • respond proactively to the documented shrinking of civic space across Europe; • strengthen structured dialogue between EU institutions and citizens’ organisations; • support policy reforms that enable a more enabling environment for CSOs, including improved funding mechanisms and reduced regulatory burdens; • shape the operationalisation of the EU’s proposed Civil Society Platform; • promote healthy environments for civic action at national and EU levels; • encourage a more participatory, inclusive, and trusted Union. At a time of increasing geopolitical pressure, disinformation, algorithmic manipulation, democratic backsliding, and fragmentation, Ireland can play a leading role in ensuring that EU policies and legislation better support citizens’ active and meaningful democratic participation for generations to come - in close alignment with the EU’s own policy priorities for the duration of this mandate."
431,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/29524abf/Senator_Lynn_Ruane_-_Submission_431.docx,None,Independent Public Representative,Public Administration,National and EU wide,3,"During its term, the Council can make a substantial positive impact across the EU by championing a model of policymaking grounded in co-design and co-creation, positively transforming how European institutions deliver for the communities they serve. Traditional consultation processes often fail to reach the communities they need to hear from the most, and as a result communities feel sidelined, or excluded from participating entirely. When participation is tokenistic or selective, policy development misses vital insights about lived and living experience that can positively impact all-of-society. Civil society can help to bridge the gap and articulate the perspectives of a broad diversity of communities, especially those that are most marginalised and disempowered. But, increasingly, civil society across our continent lacks the independence and stability to be able to organise and advocate effectively. There is also the issue of self-censorship due to fears that criticism of governing institutions can jeopardise access to funding, which creates a significant chilling effect. These issues undermine robust public dialogue and civil society’s ability to shape public policy, and erode the principles of freedom of expression and association. When people from diverse backgrounds can participate and engage openly and without fear or restraint, and when organisations representing their interests are resourced and empowered to speak freely, the quality of policymaking improves markedly. Co-design can help to instigate this shift, by bringing policymakers, service providers, CSOs, businesses and communities into the same problem-solving space from the outset. The Irish Presidency has an opportunity to demonstrate that when we embrace co-design, where stakeholders are meaningfully involved, outcomes improve across the board. Supporting civil society’s independence and capacity helps to amplify the voices of traditionally marginalised groups, disempowered communities, and those furthest from political processes. When these perspectives are embraced, policies become more inclusive and are therefore more responsive to lived experience. A thriving civic landscape can provide a robust evidence base to inform policy decisions, help to build social consensus for reform, and promote greater institutional trust, but it must be empowered and resourced effectively to do so. Strengthening our participatory democracy is therefore an investment in our shared prosperity, social cohesion, and policymaking that positively impacts individuals, communities and industry. If meaningful engagement and co-creation are embedded into the heart of EU policymaking during the Irish Presidency, the Council will demonstrate that the EU is serious about listening and adapting. Openness to dialogue, even where dissent is expressed, helps to foster trust at a time when democratic institutions face growing scepticism. It also ensures that policymaking is informed not only by governments, but by the lived and living experience of our citizens, leaving individuals, communities and industry better served, more empowered and more resilient."

Recent research published by European Movement Ireland has indicated that, whilst support for membership of the EU remains strong in Ireland, 43% of people do not feel that their views are represented at the EU level, and, concerningly, trust in governing institutions has declined sharply. People are more likely to value and defend democratic institutions when they can see themselves in the policymaking process, when they feel their experiences shape decisions, and when engagement is meaningful rather than symbolic. The task, therefore, is less about communicating the value of the EU to its citizens, and more about demonstrating it, and opening the Presidency and the broader EU project to greater public involvement. Co-design and co-creation offer a powerful way to achieve this. Diverse and engaging creative and cultural programming, community-led events and dialogues, participatory workshops and sectoral roundtables can create structured spaces for people to discuss the work of the Council. When citizens believe that their perspectives inform Ireland’s positions and priorities, the Presidency becomes something they feel they are shaping rather than observing. Engaging a diversity of voices in these processes is essential, especially those who are furthest away from political processes. These communities can contribute nuanced perspectives that enrich decision-making and increase legitimacy. The Irish Presidency can demonstrate leadership in this respect by actively reaching out to under-represented groups and providing accessible, well-supported pathways for them to participate. Ultimately, a sense of ownership will grow when people feel the EU reflects their concerns, protects their rights, and embraces their perspectives and ideas. By embedding participation into the heart of the Presidency, Ireland can help to build a stronger relationship between Europe and its citizens."

For many years now, the EU and Irish Drug Strategies have been underpinned by a shared commitment to a whole-of-society approach, strengthening sectoral and partner co-operation and actively engaging civil society. This strong commitment to embracing civil society and community engagement at the heart of our response to drugs and drug-related harms has been reflected in both EU and Irish drug policy to date, and it is essential that this constructive collaboration continues to underpin future strategies. With the EU’s Democracy Shield falling under the purview of Commissioner McGrath, the Irish Presidency should also take the opportunity to interrogate the role of manipulative interference by largely unregulated technological services and recommender systems in the lives of European citizens, and the negative impact that this has had on our democracy. The Democracy Shield focuses primarily on the interference of external mal-actors and neglects the subtly harmful role of technologies that have become integrated in our everyday lives. The Democracy Shield should expand its focus, and consider the harms caused and exacerbated by these technologies, including recommender algorithms. While technology contributes a certain value to our society, it also poses risks of significant harm. Europe has played a leading role in regulating technological services in recent years, striking a better balance between the protection of our fundamental rights, dignity and privacy, and stimulating innovation. Given the potentially transformative role of emerging technologies, like artificial intelligence, in our society, it is imperative that the EU approaches the regulation of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, with an equivalent level of skepticism, and care for citizens’ fundamental rights."

Ireland needs to defend the existing EU water legislation from it being opened up and rewritten during the EU omnibus and ensure its proper implementation – which it has consistently failed to do. It should also push for countries to implement nature-based solutions, sponge cities, tackle pollution at the source, and increase water reuse wherever possible. Nature restoration should also be a priority – the relationship between ecosystem degradation and climate change is cyclical, with one accelerating the other. Peace keeping + civil rights should also be a priority – the EU has failed on international issues like Palestine, and we have seen civil rights relating to protest and freedom of speech regarding Palestine and criticism of Israel be severely curtailed across the EU, particularly in Germany.

This also includes our significant crop science division, as one of the largest seed producers in the world, alongside our portfolio of vital crop protection products.",1,"As a large multinational life sciences company headquartered in the EU’s largest member state, Bayer believes it is becoming increasingly important that Ireland continues some of the themes from recent presidencies and the current Commission agenda for simplification, while fostering greater EU competitiveness and boosting European innovation. The EU is at a crossroad, with Europe’s choice as to the direction it takes crucial to its future international relevance. This is now Ireland’s choice, and the Irish presidency has an opportunity to draw a line under some complex and contentious policy areas, bring a fresh focus and perspective on the current geopolitical turmoil and place it in a more positive context for European businesses and citizens, initiating actions that can lead to greater European economic resilience and a more prosperous future for everyone who lives and works in the EU. The Irish presidency must choose the path of prosperity for future EU presidencies to follow. Through both the Letta and Draghi reports the imperative for the EU to focus its attention on how to boost competitiveness and close the growing innovation gap with China and the US is clear, with the pharmaceutical sector highlighted as one of the key industries to achieve this. However, so far, the EU’s actions have not fully matched this recognised imperative. There are a number of current and planned legislative files (see response to question 2) that are very significant for the pharmaceutical sector and we therefore believe that the high-level thematic priorities must provide ample scope for the Irish presidency to close or significantly progress these legislative files. Alongside our European and Irish industry associations, EFPIA and IPHA, we believe the theme should encompass both the need for greater strategic resilience for the pharmaceutical sector, alongside the need for greater economic competitiveness that leads to improved equality – specifically patient outcomes – for European citizens. The thematic priorities must also take account of how this can best be achieved. The regulatory burden on European businesses must be reduced alongside targeted measures to incentivise innovation. A renewed focus on the Single Market, particularly where this can release capital and funding across the whole value-chain and incentivise companies to scale up, is needed. With Europe falling further behind in global research and development, the Irish presidency’s thematic priorities should include leading the discussion on how investment in innovation can be realised and harnessed to deliver for European patients. Lastly, given Ireland’s leading role in promoting and enhancing women’s health, we hope this is an area the Irish presidency will consider in its thematic priorities, to see the same priority given to women’s health across Europe. This includes using the presidency to encourage self-care in health promotion and disease prevention. Specifically, Ireland is leading in how to support women through menopause, a significant un-met need across the EU, and we believe Ireland should use its presidency to highlight and coordinate a fresh EU-wide approach, potentially including in work on the upcoming gender equality strategy."

The pharmaceutical sector is uniquely positioned to simultaneously drive two key pillars of our future: better health and economic stability and growth. However, the US administration’s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) drug pricing policy is a direct and immediate challenge to the European health and welfare models. Without an immediate, decisive and coordinated European policy response, it will accelerate the erosion of Europe’s competitiveness and could delay the launch of innovative medicines in Europe. By taking immediate action in delivering faster, more comprehensive access to medicines for patients consistently across member states, by accelerating turning scientific excellence into healthcare solutions and by attracting talent, R&D and manufacturing investment, Europe can once again, become a global leader in life-sciences. We therefore believe the Biotech Act should be a flagship legislative priority for the Irish presidency, delivering greater IP protections, simplifying and harmonising the clinic trials structure, while enhancing greater access to funding and investment opportunities across the value-chain. The Biotech Act is also vital to agricultural innovation for EU farmers and must deliver meaningful change and simplify the system to boost competitiveness for the EU agrifood sector. Depending on progress made by the Cypriot presidency, Ireland should focus progress on the Critical Medicines Act on delivering genuine supply resilience, utilising its own manufacturing experience to advocate against protectionist measures that would fragment supply chains. The end goal should be on delivering better patient outcomes first, being selective about joint procurement and ensuring appropriate safeguards. The European Innovation Act is also an important file to progress, under both the simplification and competitiveness agendas. The aim for the Irish presidency should be capitalising on the potential of this Act to simplify and clarify legislation, boost investment and market incentives, while enabling access to capital and markets for companies across the value-chain. Given the scope of the “omnibus” legislative packages, it follows that these should be given suitable priority by the Irish presidency. Specifically, concluding the Environmental Omnibus and advancing the Food and Feed Safety Omnibus would be a significant step in simplifying legislation around the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and supporting agricultural innovation for EU farmers. We also hope that Ireland will take the lead in shaping the Council's position on the upcoming REACH simplification, with the aim of avoiding double-regulation with the existing profound sectoral legislations. Cognisant of the current geopolitical and trade landscape, we hope the Presidency will prioritise implementation of the EU Economic Security strategy, aiming for balance across the three pillars of ‘Promote, Protect, Partner’. This policy must reflect the new geopolitical reality, which means it should encompass a broader range of policy tools and objectives, including EU industrial and internal market policies. Finally, Ireland must seek to resolve the issue of unitary Supplementary Protection Certificates, which may still undermine IP protections and thus future investment across the life sciences."

The E and its Member States must respond with a unified, ambitious, and evidence-based strategy. The time for deliberation is over. As a matter of urgency, policy solutions to protect patient access, safeguard European innovation, and ensure that Europe maintains its strategic autonomy and resilience in the life sciences must be adopted and implemented. As a large European headquartered company, we recognise the significant positive impact EU-level decisions can have on citizens, businesses and communities in every Member State. While Ireland enjoys strong support for the EU, this is not the case across the EU and we would encourage Ireland’s presidency to focus the presidency’s activity on what will deliver tangible outcomes for everyone living and working in the EU. Bayer’s President of global Pharmaceuticals, Stefan Oelrich, as president of our European industry association, EFPIA, has the same focus on delivering tangible benefits to patients across Europe. It is why we would like to see legislative consideration for measures that will free up capital for investment in companies of all sizes across the pharmaceutical value-chain, to turn financial investment into tangible products that will lead to life changing and life saving outcomes for EU patients. It is why the competitiveness and strategic resilience agendas for the EU are so vital to get right for our sector. As a country with a strong manufacturing footprint and understanding of the value of innovative medicines, we strongly hope Ireland’s presidency will support our industry and realise the value of cooperation across the EU. To this effect, we hope the Irish Presidency will advocate for and deliver a high-level declaration of support by the European Council for Europe’s research-based pharmaceutical sector, reaffirming our sector’s strategic importance to the EU and a commitment to invest in the sector’s future, for the greater benefit of European patients. Currently, access to innovative medicines for EU citizens is not equal. Greater support for actions that reduce time-to-treatment gaps is needed. The fact that there is not uniform adherence to the implementation of the Transparency Directive and 180-day decision requirement is a significant obstacle to equal access to innovative medicines. Obstacles such as this are why we would like to see the Irish Presidency also work towards the creation of a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce, composed of the European Commission, Member States, and industry partners. It is only by having a forum such as this, involving all necessary stakeholders, that we believe the EU will be able to tackle the challenge of boosting competitiveness for our sector, protect the strategic resilience for the future and ultimately deliver better health outcomes for European citizens."

Much of Ireland’s presidency work will inevitably be of a technical nature, including work involving our own sectors. We would therefore strongly encourage the Irish Presidency to work with IPHA and EFPIA, as our pharmaceutical representative associations, on an event that places the sector at the heart of discussions around strategic resilience for the EU, in tandem with the public declaration of support mentioned previously. The pharmaceutical sector necessitates strong cooperation across the EU to maximise the potential of innovative medicines for patients – including the single approval system of the European Medicines Agency, the increasing efficiency of joint Health Technology Assessments, supply-chain impact of the Single Market, and the research benefits of scientific collaboration across the EU. But there is a lot more that needs to be done to truly realise the potential of the EU for European patients and we would therefore welcome greater patient involvement and understanding. The event proposed by IPHA is one such opportunity. We also support the suggestion of regional engagement during Ireland’s presidency, including high-profile site visits to pharmaceutical and life-science facilities in Ireland and across EU Member States. As an industry, we are working to raise awareness of individual patient stories, to both raise awareness, but also to provide some positivity and understanding across the many therapeutic areas. We would welcome the Irish Presidency taking a similar approach, to highlight the impact EU-level policy decision have in citizens’ everyday lives, as well as supporting European businesses, employment and scientific research. Any communication initiatives that demonstrate the interconnectedness of the European health infrastructure would be very welcome."

This directly supports the Strategic Agenda’s emphasis on “equality”, “democratic resilience”, and “reducing disparities”. Ireland can build continuity with the Cypriot Presidency by embedding gender-responsive budgeting as a core dimension of EU policy, regulation, and investment frameworks. A second priority should be accelerating progress in women’s health, with a focus on endometriosis, reproductive care, and gender-sensitive care. This responds to the Strategic Agenda commitment to “further strengthen health cooperation at European and international level and improve access to medicines across the Union.” Ireland can champion women’s health as both a social imperative and an economic one, reducing productivity loss and enhancing labour-market participation. With Ireland’s investment and success with the Women’s Health Action Plans, this focus would position Ireland as a leader in women’s health policy. Third, Ireland should elevate the care economy as a pillar of Europe’s competitiveness. A public model of high-quality childcare is essential infrastructure for economic growth, gender equality, and meeting demographic challenges. The Presidency can frame childcare investment as a competitiveness priority aligned with the Agenda’s vision for “increased participation in the labour market. Fourthly, Ireland is uniquely placed to highlight all-island cooperation within EU frameworks – showcasing cross-border models of peace, health cooperation, DSGBV response and innovation as aligned with the Agenda’s priorities on cohesion, resilience, neighbourhood stability, and territorial development. Fifth, Ireland’s establishment of Cuan – the national agency with statutory responsibility for DSGBV –positions the State as a leader in coordinated, whole-of-government responses. This experience can inform EU work on governance models that improve citizen safety, participation and equality. Lastly, Ireland should bring a gendered-dimension to the green and digital transitions. As Europe moves along the path of climate neutrality by 2050, we must ensure that women and marginalised communities are central to “a just and fair climate transition.” Together, these priorities position Ireland’s Presidency as one focused on equality-driven competitiveness, strengthened democratic resilience, and delivering visible benefits for citizens."

Ireland should progress EU-wide methodologies for gender and equality-impact assessments, improved data systems, and expenditure tracking. This directly supports the Strategic Agenda’s commitments to “ensuring that the EU budget is fit for the future.” Ireland should advance the European Care Strategy by positioning childcare as essential economic infrastructure. Priorities should include EU-wide indicators for accessibility and affordability, guidance on sustainable public childcare models, and greater alignment between care policies and economic governance processes such as the European Semester. Ireland should also prioritise women’s participation in democratic life, focusing on gender quotas, combating disinformation, and protections from online harassment targeting women in public roles. This complements the Strategic Agenda’s vision for protecting “democratic discourse” and “free and pluralistic media and civil society.” Finally, Ireland should promote all-island and regional cooperation within cohesion policy, research, health data infrastructure, and DSGBV responses."

Second, prioritising childcare and the care economy will expand labour-market participation, promote youth and female employment, and enhance competitiveness. By positioning care infrastructure as essential to economic strategy, Ireland can recognise the fundamental role of state-led care infrastructure in our EU economy. This approach benefits businesses by supporting workforce stability and benefits families by improving access to public, affordable, and high-quality care. Third, advancing women’s health, particularly in areas of high unmet need such as endometriosis, will reduce the economic burden of chronic conditions and improve social well-being.

Communication strategies should also embed meaningful ways of reaching marginalised groups, including Traveller and Roma women, migrant women, victims-survivors of DSGBV, disabled women, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Ireland should promote the Presidency as an example of inclusive, participatory democracy. This includes structured engagement with civil society, youth groups, community organisations, and marginalised communities. Citizens’ dialogues, regional forums, and sector-specific consultations can create a sense of involvement and ownership. Digital engagement should be modern, interactive, and accessible. Ireland can leverage creative formats – e.g. short video explainers and social media storytelling – to highlight progress and showcase the collaborative nature of EU decision-making. Ireland is uniquely positioned to highlight all-island cooperation as a story of the EU’s positive and stabilising influence. Showcasing cross-border health initiatives, research collaboration, infrastructure projects, all-island DSGBV initiatives, and peacebuilding partnerships provides a compelling narrative of EU membership as a foundation for stability and shared prosperity. The Presidency should also emphasise that the EU’s core values – including equality and democracy –align strongly with Ireland’s own social commitment. By highlighting Ireland’s leadership on equality, women’s health, democratic participation, and DSGBV, the Presidency can show citizens that Ireland shapes Europe in ways that reflect national priorities and values.

Ireland is well placed to encourage the effective implementation of existing EU water environment legislation, including the Water Framework Directive (WFD), Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, Maritime Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD), the Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR), Habitats Directive and other related instruments. Ireland’s Presidency can help drive a renewed EU effort to translate these policies into tangible, positive conservation outcomes. We propose these actions focussed on relevant policy and legislative areas, and outcomes: Water Environment Drive coherent implementation of the revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, ensuring strong provisions on nutrient removal, stormwater management, and micro-pollutant control. Support mainstreaming of nature-based solutions for water management, flood prevention, and climate adaptation across EU funding and policy instruments. Promote ambitious national implementation of the WFD and uphold the “no deterioration” principle, resisting any moves to weaken its environmental objectives or timelines. Ensure momentum for restoration targets for wetlands, rivers, and marine habitats in the Nature Restoration Law. Support stronger mechanisms for compliance with environmental legislation across Member States. Reinforce the principles of the Aarhus Convention, improving transparency, access to justice, and public engagement in environmental decision-making. Marine Protected Areas The delivery of the EU-wide commitment to establish a coherent network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) across 30% of European waters by 2030. Although this target has already been agreed, many Member States, including Ireland, are falling behind. Ireland’s upcoming national MPA legislation, currently being drafted to meet these obligations, provides a timely opportunity to align national ambition with EU-level leadership during the Presidency. Simplification must not mean deregulation The Commission is currently on a drive to “simplify” EU regulation, including very recently adopted measures that form part of the European Green Deal. While seeking to ensure regulation achieves its objectives efficiently is theoretically uncontroversial, in practice the process so far has been accompanied by a strong deregulation push that clearly risks undermining standards and outcomes for EU citizens and the environment. Some companies, industry alliances and their well-paid lobbyists (especially fossil fuel companies, big tech and chemical companies) are using this political pivot from the Commission to seek wholescale deregulation (in a “shock doctrine” style manipulation of current geopolitical and geo-economic turbulence), However, many experts, institutions and agencies, including the ECB for example, are warning that this not in fact good for business as a whole, who benefit from regulatory certainty, and is essentially punishing those businesses that have invested in transition, is rewarding laggards and undermines the EU’s transition to long-term sustainability and prosperity. One example for water is the alarming review and weakening of the Water Framework Directive. Freshwater ecosystems are already in critical condition, and further damage will worsen health risks while reducing their ability to shield us from climate disasters. The Irish Presidency has a duty and an opportunity to uphold the future-oriented standard setting that has epitomized EU innovation and protects citizens, our environment and our common future. The new Multilateral Financial Framework must ensure adequate and dedicated funding for: nature restoration, to deliver the Nature Restoration Law in partnership with farmers, communities and environmentalists economically, socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture, including “fully funded Pillar Two of CAP, including LEADER” as Minister Byrne put it to us recently. civil society and active citizenship, including continuing LIFE funding"

Water quality, marine health, and the sustainable management of our aquatic ecosystems sit at the intersection of climate, biodiversity, energy, and food policies, areas that will be central to European debate during the Presidency. To speak credibly on these priorities at EU level, Ireland must first ensure it is meeting its own obligations under key directives and strategies. Ireland’s record on water quality remains a persistent concern. The most recent EPA Water Quality in Ireland report shows that nearly half of monitored rivers and lakes are in less-than-good ecological status and the number of these is growing, while nitrate and phosphate pollution pressures are rising in many catchments. As a Presidency, Ireland will be expected to coordinate and advance negotiations on various water environment related files. However, ongoing EU infringement proceedings against Ireland under the WFD, the Habitats Directive, Drinking Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive risk undermining our credibility in convening discussions on Europe’s water future. Before taking the helm, the Government should take demonstrable steps to show progress in tackling agricultural pollution, upgrading wastewater infrastructure, and preventing physical damage to our waters. The recent ruling by the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of its obligations under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a case in point. Two significant steps Ireland could take in addressing this breach are: The exemption threshold for abstraction is way too high and should be dropped to at least 10m3 Review the Arterial Drainage Act as promised in the Water Action Plan so as to reduce the physical damage to our waterways in Ireland, such as dredging, draining and damage to habitats. Furthermore, Ireland must transition farmers off the nitrate’s derogation over the next three years. The science shows that Ireland’s water quality is declining and there are no evidence-based measures in Ireland’s Nitrates Action Programme that will improve water quality in three years to ensure Ireland gets the derogation again. This is unfair to farmers who will be once again brought to a cliff-edge economically. Ireland cannot hold credibility if it continues to plan to seek derogation while its lakes and rivers are dying, such as Lady’s Island’s lake, whose green polluted waters can be seen from space. Ireland’s marine environment also requires urgent attention. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) commits member states to achieving “Good Environmental Status” in their marine waters, yet Ireland’s most recent marine assessment highlights serious gaps in data, monitoring, and implementation. Pressures, such as aquaculture, pollution and overfishing, continue to compound challenges for marine biodiversity. The designation and effective management of Marine Protected Areas, targeted to cover 30% of Ireland’s maritime area by 2030, must be accelerated. Delivering this commitment is essential both to meeting EU Biodiversity Strategy targets and to positioning Ireland as a credible advocate for marine ambition during its Presidency. Setting a high bar domestically would not only bolster Ireland’s standing in Brussels but also deliver tangible benefits to rural communities, coastal economies, and ecosystems at home. Action on freshwater and marine protection should be framed not merely as regulatory compliance but as a central investment in Ireland’s environmental resilience, public health, and sustainable economic future. Ireland can only lead on Europe’s environmental agenda if it first restores ambition and credibility at home."

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) should underpin all ‘three priority themes’. With the 2030 deadline approaching, Ireland should use its Presidency to re-energise EUMS/EU efforts to deliver on the SDGs, particularly for those furthest behind: promoting policy coherence for development across all Council formations, supporting equitable and sustainable partnerships, and advocating for scaled-up development and climate finance. One of the priority three themes should focus on the EU’s external action, by aiming to reinforce principled humanitarian and development policies, and demonstrate leadership grounded in solidarity and human rights. Under this thematic priority, Ireland should focus on five specific inter-related issues: Promote robust EU policy and financing for fragile and conflict-affected contexts. As negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) advance, Ireland should ensure that sufficient political attention is dedicated to the humanitarian aid, resilience and human development components of the proposed Global Europe Instrument. Support the re-prioritisation of food security and nutrition as foundational pillars for sustainable growth and prosperity. Ireland’s sustained leadership at global forums, including Nutrition for Growth (N4G) and the UN Food Systems Summits, positions it well to drive ambitious EU engagement on ending hunger and malnutrition. As the EU moves to implement its own N4G commitments, Ireland can encourage clearer targets, longer-term investment, and stronger accountability. Using its convening power, Ireland can promote support for resilient and inclusive nutrition sensitive food systems and ensure that EU policies prioritise vulnerable and crisis-affected communities. Champion access to quality education in emergencies, especially for girls, as a core element of Ireland’s development policy and Presidency priorities. Advocate for full implementation of DG ECHO’s commitment to allocate at least 10% of EU humanitarian aid to Education in Emergencies through 2027 and into the next MFF and Global Europe negotiations, including ensuring clear implementation pathways, robust accountability and coherence across EU funding instruments. Ireland’s Programme for Government commitment to Afghanistan’s women and girls should translate into specific actions to highlight and identify initiatives at EU level that will improve their lives. Advocate for a clear EU position that climate finance must not deepen debt burdens and ensure that grant-based support becomes central to the EU’s contribution to the New Collective Quantified Goal. As Council President, Ireland will lead the EU delegation at COP and can ensure EU discussions give due consideration for prioritising grants over loans, emphasising the importance of fairness, debt sustainability, and accessibility for least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). Elevate Sudan as a core Presidency cross-cutting priority and leverage any diplomatic influence to address what is now the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Ireland should use its diplomatic influence to elevate Sudan on the Council agenda, press for a cessation of hostilities and a negotiated political solution, and mobilise stronger EU action. This must include championing a coherent regional approach to provide adequate humanitarian assistance to civilians in neighbouring countries, supporting coordinated cross-border assistance, reinforcing protection for refugees. Given Ireland’s appreciation of the importance of and leadership on conflict-induced hunger, Ireland has a credible role to play in highlighting the links between conflict and hunger, including the EU’s role in condemning the use of starvation as a weapon of war."
378,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/366a91f3/Concern_Worldwide_-_Submission_378.docx,Concern Worldwide,,,,2,"In connection with the above five proposed issues there are specific policy areas and supporting processes that Ireland should focus on, these are as follows: Considering the 2026 Communication on humanitarian aid which is likely to be published under the Cypriot Presidency of the Council, Ireland can work to ensure well-informed Council Conclusions, which will be considered by the Commission for the implementation of the Communication on humanitarian aid. Throughout 2026, Ireland should influence the COHAFA agenda, to ensure sufficient time is allocated for discussion and briefings from civil society organisations who engaged in the consultation processes for the 2026 Communication on humanitarian aid – particularly on the issues highlighted in Q1. Evidence and perspectives from those most deeply affected by crises and those trying to address the impacts of crises, strengthen decision-making and understanding and is irreplaceable. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy & Vice-President of the European Commission was tasked in her mission letter to lead on developing a renewed EU approach to the Sahel, and progress has been made, including the validation of the principles of a renewed approach at the November 2025 Foreign Affairs Council. While the renewed EU approach to the Sahel is likely to be finalised before Ireland takes up the presidency, the challenges in terms of EU engagement in the Sahel will continue into Ireland’s presidency, and Ireland should include Sahel in the COAFR agenda and allow sufficient time for discussions to focus on how the EU can continue to support human development and humanitarian diplomacy in this fragile region. The EU recent N4G pledge signified there is continued financial and political commitment, however existing EU frameworks, such as the Action Plan on Nutrition (2015–2025) and the Guidelines on Addressing Undernutrition in Emergencies, are now outdated and poorly aligned with newer EU priorities. Ireland can play a pivotal role by inviting the Commission to update the EU Nutrition Policy Framework, which is urgently needed, particularly in light of the recent ODA cuts. For this, Ireland can leverage a recent European Court of Auditor’s special report on the Commission’s support to fight hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa which notes that the shift in focus from addressing malnutrition to supporting value chains risks sidelining chronic nutrition crises, and as such nutrition is losing prominence on the EU agenda. This trend is reinforced by the Global Gateway initiative, which prioritises other sectors and does not directly address food insecurity or malnutrition. Ireland should use its presidency to put nutrition high on the EU’s political agenda. Integrating nutrition across relevant Council agendas would help reverse declining global attention and reaffirm nutrition as a foundation for sustainable development and stability. Ireland should place Sudan at the heart of the Foreign Affairs Council agenda and leverage its political leadership – including by convening a high-level Ministerial Roundtable on Sudan - to help mobilize the attention, action and resources required to address one of the world’s most severe and underfunded humanitarian emergencies. Fragile and neglected contexts like Afghanistan should also be considered. Ireland should use the presidency to challenge EUMS and UNMS on the scourge, normalisation and political apathy related to conflict-induced hunger. Ireland can play a pivotal role in mobilizing collective EU action against conflict-induced food insecurity, advocating for the EU to continue to condemn the use of starvation as a weapon of war—in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2417 - and to prioritize immediate, coordinated responses to address the devastating levels of conflictdriven hunger Ireland’s focus on and engagement in the development of Gender Action Plan IV will be essential, as a progressive country which promotes and protects all forms of equality. Regardless of challenges, GAP IV should not only sustain but strengthen the momentum built under GAP III. GAP IV presents a crucial opportunity for the EU to reaffirm and strengthen its commitment to gender equality as a core value and strategic priority in its external action. To do so, it should focus even more on implementation, deepen partnerships with organisations working to promote and sustain gender equality, develop mechanisms to correctly track investments in gender to ensure an accurate analysis of meaningful financial and political support, and allocate adequate resources and capacity to deliver and implement GAP IV."

Using Ireland’s arts and cultural heritage, the presidency should spotlight how solidarity, human rights, and peace shaped Ireland’s transformation - a much-needed story right now. This narrative reinforces the importance of education as an investment throughout life - not just formal schooling but lifelong learning and global citizenship education that equips people to participate fully in society, foster social cohesion and adapt to a changing economy. It also highlights the role of the arts in telling stories of perseverance and the need to keep communities at the heart of progress. Irelands place in the world is informed by and influenced by Irish people who support the development agenda, the reputation of Ireland on the global stage. Emphasizing the value of Ireland’s global standing, and the important role the commitment to ODA play in that is important. Ireland has benefited significantly from investment, evident in the prosperity and development in the country, and there is a strong willingness to use our solidarity, empathy and wealth to continue to promote the SDGs, the importance of humanitarian aid, and the values of equality at a global level. The EU DEAR programme is an important element of bringing communities together, to share the vision of the EU and educate and inform citizens about the value of the EU being values driven and working collectively to improve the lives of EU citizens, in a safer, more equal and prosperous world. The prosperity of people, businesses and communities across the EU is dependent on global stability – Ireland’s own journey from poverty and conflict to peace and growth is proof of this. During its Presidency, Ireland can help the Council ensure discussions reflect the values Strategic Agenda for the Union for 202429: “… continuing to be the strongest supporter of the international legal order, steadfastly upholding the United Nations and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. In particular, the European Union will pursue efforts to promote global peace, justice and stability, as well as democracy, universal human rights and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in all international fora. We will strive for a reformed multilateral system, making it more inclusive and more effective”.

The communications strategy should be rooted in Global Citizenship Education (GCE) as a guiding approach – helping people understand how EU membership connects to their daily lives and communities. This strategy should consider the following: Prioritise meaningful engagement over digital noise. While social media has a role, over-reliance on digital messaging will not create impact or ownership. People need space to meet, discuss, and question – community forums and partnerships with local organisations should be central. Elected representatives and civil servants must be well-briefed on the approach and equipped to communicate why Ireland as an EU MS matters, why multilateralism matters and how Ireland’s Presidency is of importance to all. Ownership only comes when people feel included. Bringing citizens together through schools, cultural/arts events and local dialogues, will reinforce that the EU is not a distant political concept, but a part of their everyday lives. National and local media should be engaged to tell stories that resonate to their audiences in a way that enables them to develop informed opinions about the influence EU decisions have on their lives and the lives of others around the globe. Taking inspiration from Ireland’s recent Presidential election, for the EU presidency, the government and the Department of Foreign Affairs should invest in a strong, positive and comprehensive communications strategy that prioritizes authentic, empathic, face-to-face engagement with people in Ireland. This strategy should have a clear objective to foster connections and community across the globe, and build support, understanding and appreciation of what it means to be a proud EU and Irish citizen."

The UN charter has been routinely undermined in recent years while attacks on the International Criminal Court damage a key accountability pillar in the international system. The trend of democratic backsliding over the past decade has narrowed the space in which human rights defenders have to work while the risks they face remain severe. According to the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, at least 625 human rights defenders and media workers were killed or disappeared in 2024, the highest number ever recorded. Simultaneously, human rights defenders around the world have become increasingly vocal in questioning the adherence of traditionally supportive states to the values contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Against this backdrop and in keeping with the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, which includes as a priority “upholding the UN Charter” and “protecting free and pluralistic media and civil society"" within the “Free and Democratic Europe” pillar, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders believes the Irish Presidency should re-emphasize the EU’s commitment to its foundational principles of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights. It should make clear the EU’s respect for international human rights law and the institutions designed to deliver it. As highlighted in the Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, values emphasising respect for human rights are “EU’s primary strength, as well as its compass both within the EU and globally”. Within this broader policy area, the Special Rapporteur encourages a specific focus on human rights defenders who hold EU citizenship and who have been imprisoned for, or sentenced to terms of, ten years or more outside of EU borders. These individuals serving lengthy prison sentences as a result of promoting values championed by the EU serve as both a stark reminder of the impunity which exist for human rights violations globally and the inability of the EU thus far to have secured their release. Focsusing on their cases during the Irish Presidency would send a powerful signal that the EU, at least under the Irish Presidency, follows through on the principles it promotes and does not abandon its own citizens who are imprisoned for peaceful human rights activism. In my capacity as UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders, I am aware of three such cases: Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, joint Danish - Bahraini citizenship, serving life imprisonment for his peaceful activities in the 2011 pro-democracy protests; Dawit Isaak, joint Swedish - Eritrean citizenship, imprisoned since 2001 for his reporting and writing on calls for democracy; Abdoul Aziz Goma, joint Irish - Togolese citizenship, serving 10 years in prison for his provision of shelter to a group of young protesters calling for political reform."

Security of Europe's energy supply Ireland should ensure it has operationalised the Hydrogen & Decarbonised Gas Market Package on time transposing Directive (EU) 2024/1788 by mid‑2026. As Council Presidency in H2 2026, use its agenda‑setting role to accelerate EU‑level practicalities (ENNOH, integrated hydrogen, gas, electricity planning, and timely secondary measures), moving the framework from paper to practice. Scaling up sustainability of data centres and Large Energy Users EU data‑centre electricity use is rising towards ~115 TWh by 2030, with grid connection lead times and local adequacy emerging as key constraints. Ireland should broker a common framework that: Sets minimum efficiency metrics (e.g., PUE/SPUE) and requires participation in flexibility markets (demand response, behind‑the‑meter storage/RES, ancillary services). Enables non‑firm/phased connections and strategic siting near renewable and hydrogen infrastructure, and reuses waste heat into district networks where viable. Recognises hydrogen technologies (fuel cells/turbines) for low‑emission back‑up and peak support where necessary, ensuring digital growth strengthens energy security and climate goals. Agreement the EU's long-term budget To convert targets into projects, the Presidency should prioritise agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework and related instruments that channel funding to grids, flexibility, hydrogen infrastructure and projects (including IPCEIs and the Hydrogen Bank), while simplifying permitting and access to capital. This aligns with the Commission’s 2026 work programme which foresees an Energy Security Package and Electrification Strategy and with the inter‑institutional priority to build a genuine Energy Union before 2030. A budget settlement that couples simplification with targeted investment will lower system costs for citizens and businesses, enhance competitiveness and accelerate security‑enhancing clean fuels across the Union."

To unblock investment in renewable hydrogen and e‑fuels. Presidency asks: Ireland proposes that the Commission, as part of the Energy Security Package and in parallel with the European Hydrogen Bank, table a targeted amendment to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1184 and supporting guidance. Europe must accelerate investments in energy infrastructure and for that it needs to create the right conditions through simplification of the highly complex regulatory environment for companies, especially the energy-intensive industry. Also, as rightly pointed out by the Draghi report, access to affordable energy and feedstock, including renewable and low carbon hydrogen, is essential to ensure European industry remains competitive. For example, the temporal correlation is hindering projects: strict requirements, like hourly temporal correlation, raise the cost of renewable hydrogen by 25% to 35% (this can easily represent 1.5-2eur/kg of hydrogen). The additionality principle makes electricity more expensive and, in most cases, unavailable in the short term; especially in times when other electricity-hungry players like datacenters are quickly developing across Europe. The geographical correlation restricts the pool of renewable energy assets hydrogen producers can rely on when producing RFNBO-compliant energy. That is why we would like to recommend a targeted revision of the RFNBOs Delegated Acts, focusing on feasible and more flexible implementation. One way of adopting the rules without having to engage in a lengthy process could be by extending the transitional period both for additionality and temporal correlation."

Flexibility lowers peak prices, reduces redispatch/curtailment and improves reliability, directly benefiting households and SMEs; ENTSO‑E projects pan‑EU flexibility needs will roughly double by 2030, underlining the urgency Turn hydrogen rules into investable projects The Council should move from legislation to implementation of the Hydrogen & Decarbonised Gas Market Package, integrating hydrogen into Ten‑Year Network Development Plans and enabling cost‑effective repurposing of suitable gas assets. That creates predictable network access and market rules, stabilising investor expectations and enabling long‑term contracts for industry. Scale renewable hydrogen supply and offtake Under Ireland’s chairing, the Council can back the European Hydrogen Bank auctions (including “Auctions‑as‑a‑Service”) to bring RFNBO projects to final investment decision with 10‑year fixed terms and invite the Commission to align auction timetables with infrastructure/industrial demand hubs. This accelerates clean‑fuel availability for hard‑to‑electrify sectors (such as the HGV fleet across Europe) and diversifies energy sources away from volatile fossil imports. Provide RFNBO certainty and lower delivery risk To ensure molecules are genuinely renewable yet financeable, the Council can request targeted guidance and an amending Delegated Act under (EU) 2023/1184 that preserves integrity while streamlining compliance (e.g., pragmatic temporal/geographic correlation where electrolysers deliver system benefits). This reduces transaction costs, supports long‑term PPAs and speeds project delivery. Make digital growth strengthen, not strain, energy systems Council conclusions on sustainable, flexible data centres minimum efficiency metrics (PUE/SPUE), participation in flexibility markets, non‑firm/phased connections, strategic siting and waste‑heat recovery and ensure AI‑driven demand does not undermine security or affordability, and can even provide local flexibility where hydrogen or storage can be co‑located. Finance delivery at scale A political agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework linked to the Commission’s 2026 Energy Security Package should prioritise grids, storage, hydrogen infrastructure/IPCEIs and the Hydrogen Bank, with simplified access and permitting.

We should explicitly link the 2026 Presidency to that founding moment we worked to develop the EU in 1975; let’s continue the journey together in 2026. Interactive ""Action"" Events: Instead of abstract policy meetings, the Presidency should host a major ""Accelerating Permitting"" conference involving civil society to discuss how renewable projects deliver local benefits. o Hydrogen Ireland will be organising key hydrogen events in Dublin in the 2nd half of 2026 and would be keen to include Government Department representation. We will also continue our engagement at a EU level with the Clean Hydrogen Partnership and Hydrogen Europe. In 2026 we will also join the EU Hydrogen Council. Local Benefits Focus: Communication should highlight how EU directives support Community Benefit Funds and how renewable projects contribute local rates to County Councils, directly funding community services. Showcasing Irish Success: Showcasing Irish success (innovation + culture): Use the Presidency to host “Energy Innovation Days” to showcase Irish projects, SMEs, researchers and communities delivering the transition (including hydrogen where relevant). To reach audiences who don’t engage with policy, pair the technical programme with focused cultural engagement, such as an energy-themed art competition or exhibition (visual art, photography, short film) that illustrates Ireland’s energy story and the EU’s contribution to the transition through accessible images and narratives. This broadens participation, increases public visibility, and supports genuine citizen ownership. Ireland’s Presidency works across the island of Ireland reflecting the all island nature of the energy networks: Ireland should showcase the success of relationships with third countries such as GB/NI through successes in The Shared Island Fund. Emissions and energy challenge is cross border issue. Benefit for Ireland: Increased public engagement fosters ""social licence"" for essential infrastructure. By clearly linking EU policy to local economic wins (jobs, community funds), we can reduce local opposition to the grid and renewable projects required for Ireland’s future."

Hydrogen Ireland would suggest three additional proposals for consideration, aligned with EU strategic priorities on climate neutrality, energy security, data security, industrial competitiveness, and regional cohesion. High Level Hydrogen Summit: ‘From Green Electrons to Green Molecules – Europe’s Island Advantage’ Ireland could host a High Level Hydrogen Summit during the Presidency transition period, convening EU energy ministers, senior Commission representatives, industry leaders, research institutions, and island and peripheral region stakeholders. The purpose of the summit would be to position Ireland as a convenor of European dialogue on the role of clean hydrogen in enabling resilient, decentralised, and integrated energy systems. The theme. ‘From Green Electrons to Green Molecules – Europe’s Island Advantage,’ reflects the strategic opportunity for Ireland and other island or peripheral regions to lead in renewable hydrogen production, system coupling, and innovation in maritime, aviation, and heavy transport decarbonisation. The summit would also highlight Ireland’s offshore renewable energy potential, its emerging hydrogen valleys, and the role of cross border cooperation with partners such as Cyprus, the North Sea region, and the Atlantic seaboard. This event would serve as a blueprint for how Europe can leverage geographically diverse renewable resources to strengthen energy security, accelerate industrial transformation, and support the EU’s wider climate and competitiveness agenda. Council Conclusion on Hydrogen for Strategic Autonomy Ireland could propose a Council Conclusion on Hydrogen for Strategic Autonomy, developed in partnership with other geographically peripheral and island EU Member States, including Cyprus. Such a conclusion would recognise the essential role of renewable hydrogen in achieving the EU’s objectives for energy resilience, transport decarbonisation, and industrial competitiveness. The proposal would emphasise: The importance of hydrogen in balancing variable offshore renewable energy and enabling system flexibility. The need for targeted support for island and peripheral regions with high renewable potential but limited interconnection capacity. The role of hydrogen in decarbonising hard to electrify sectors such as maritime transport, aviation, heavy industry, and long distance mobility. Opportunities for Europe to lead globally in hydrogen innovation, standards, and certification. The value of coordinated EU action to accelerate infrastructure development, skills, and investment certainty. A Council Conclusion of this nature would reinforce Ireland’s leadership in shaping Europe’s clean energy future while ensuring that the specific needs and opportunities of island regions are fully reflected in EU policy frameworks. 3. EU Framework for Sustainable, Grid Integrated Data Centres Ireland could propose an EU level initiative to develop a coherent framework for sustainable, grid integrated data centres that supports Europe’s digital sovereignty while ensuring energy/system resilience. As a country with one of the highest concentrations of data centres in Europe, Ireland has deep practical experience in managing the intersection of digital infrastructure, grid capacity, renewable integration, and community impact. This proposal would encourage the EU to adopt a systems based approach to data centre development, focusing on: • Grid aware planning that aligns new data centre capacity with renewable generation zones, offshore wind development, and future hydrogen enabled flexibility. Demand side flexibility through on site electrolysers, thermal storage, and smart load management to reduce peak demand and support system balancing. Circular water and heat systems, including advanced water reuse technologies and district heating integration, to reduce environmental impact and support local communities. Hydrogen ready backup and resilience systems to replace diesel generation and accelerate the transition to zero carbon digital infrastructure. EU wide standards for energy efficiency, water stewardship, and carbon transparency to ensure competitiveness and consistency across Member States. A Presidency led initiative in this area would position Ireland as a thought leader in the future of sustainable digital infrastructure, while supporting the EU’s broader goals on climate neutrality, strategic autonomy, and digital leadership."

We believe Ireland is uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between high-level EU ambition and on-the-ground operational reality. We suggest three thematic priorities: Accelerating Technology Adoption for Economic Growth. With many new digital laws adopted, the Irish Presidency must ensure EU Member States focus on delivering technology adoption to build growth. Europe currently trails global competitors in converting technological capacity and innovation into economic gain. Ireland should lead an agenda that incentivizes the practical uptake of digital tools, including AI and cloud, across the public sector, SMEs and large enterprises. By positioning the EU not just as a regulator, but as a super-adopter, Ireland can demonstrate how responsible deployment drives the growth required to sustain the European model. The ""Skills-First"" Labour Market. Europe faces a dual challenge: a shrinking working-age population and a rapid evolution in job requirements, underpinned by the AI revolution. Ireland should champion a shift from traditional degree-based credentials to a flexible ""Skills-First"" economy. The Presidency should prioritise policies that support skills-based hiring and mobility, ensuring the workforce is agile enough to prosper alongside digital and AI transformation. This approach aligns with Ireland’s status as a global talent hub and transforms technological disruption into a catalyst for growth. Delivering the Single Market and Keeping Markets Open. The focus of the Irish Presidency - and EU as a whole - must shift from legislative creation to the seamless implementation and operation of a true Single Market. The Presidency should champion policies which enable businesses to easily scale and grow across the EU - such as a meaningful 28th Regime - and adopt an open, risk- and evidence-based approach to digital sovereignty, which reinforces open markets and facilitates access to trusted best-in-class technology. European enterprises need confidence that they can leverage the most advanced global technology innovations securely - including cloud and AI, without facing fragmentation or protectionist barriers that stifle competitiveness."
71,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a01c6c2f/Workday_-_Submission_71.docx,Workday,Multinational business,technology,National/ EU,2,"The Irish Presidency should secure Council positions and conclude trilogues on digital regulations proposed in late 2025 or expected in H1 2026. The Presidency must steer EU Member States towards regulations which drive real simplification, foster competition and maintain openness to trusted global partners. These include: Digital Omnibus and AI Omnibus The Irish Presidency must urgently work to adopt the Digital Omnibus and AI Omnibus proposals, if not finalized during the Cypriot Presidency, to deliver immediate relief to businesses in Europe. The Council must be ambitious to reduce administrative burden by removing overlapping and contradictory compliance obligations and ensure a risk-based approach to policymaking that prioritises tangible impact over box-ticking. A successful outcome in the Council would be a harmonized rulebook that delivers legal certainty, lowers the cost of compliance and accelerates the adoption of AI technologies by European businesses, thereby driving competitiveness rather than layering on red tape. Cybersecurity Act (Review) In reviewing the Cybersecurity Act, the Presidency must focus on strengthening Europe’s cyber resilience without fragmenting the Single Market or excluding global leaders. The priority is ensuring equal treatment for trusted global companies invested in Europe within future cybersecurity certification schemes (such as cloud services). The Council must avoid including protectionist ""sovereignty requirements,” such as mandatory local ownership or data localization, which act as non-technical trade barriers, raise costs and prevent European businesses from obtaining best-in-class technologies. Instead, the Irish Presidency must champion a risk-based, technical approach to security that allows trusted partners like Workday to contribute their best-in-class capabilities to securely deliver services to European businesses, ensuring that security standards are high, rigorous, and inclusive. Cloud and AI Development Act For the Cloud and AI Development Act, the Irish Presidency should steer the Council toward an investment-focused Act rather than a defensive one. The priority must be to drive competitiveness and innovation by fostering an open ecosystem for high-performance computing and cloud infrastructure. We urge the Presidency to ensure that eligibility for EU procurement and incentives in cloud and AI remains open to all companies adhering to EU rules, anchored in technical criteria rather than origin. Excluding trusted global players from this framework would slow down Europe’s AI and cloud adoption, and limit choices for European customers. The focus must be on building and accelerating infrastructure, capacity and skills, not erecting digital borders. Public Procurement Act The revision of the Public Procurement Act offers a critical opportunity to modernize how the public sector buys technology. The Presidency should prioritize positions that move away from ""lowest price"" criteria toward ""best value"", while ensuring the revision does not add administrative burdens for vendors or further entrench incumbents. Furthermore, the Council should oppose any ""Buy European"" clauses that discriminate against trusted global companies. Public authorities need access to the best global technology to digitize effectively; prioritizing origin over quality, security and sustainability directly undermines the EU’s own digitalization goals."
71,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a01c6c2f/Workday_-_Submission_71.docx,Workday,Multinational business,technology,National/ EU,3,"The Irish Presidency arrives at a defining moment for the European Union. To deliver substantial impact for citizens, businesses and communities, the Council’s work must focus on competitiveness as the engine for our economic, social and environmental goals. Europe faces a growing number of systemic pressures: an aging population that strains our social safety nets, the urgent need for climate action and energy independence, and a persistent challenge of low productivity. We cannot address these issues in isolation. Funding the green transition, caring for an older society, and securing our energy future all require a dynamic, growing economy. To maintain Europe’s status as a top global region to live in, we must increase productivity through technology and innovation. The Irish Presidency can lead this renewal by orienting the Council toward three strategic pillars: Unlocking Productivity through Digitalization. Technology is the multiplier that will enable us to do more with less. The Presidency should prioritize the rapid finalization of the Digital and AI Omnibus, aiming to clear the regulatory thicket that currently stifles innovation. By harmonizing rules and reducing administrative burdens, we can accelerate the development and adoption of trusted AI and digital tools necessary to decarbonize our industries and modernize our workforce. This is about giving every European business the tools to drive the growth needed to sustain our social model. Mobilizing Capital and Talent. Growth requires fuel: investment and people. The Presidency must deepen the Single Market to unlock intra-EU investment and prioritize skilling initiatives that prepare the European workforce for the AI era. Second, we must remain a magnet for the world. Europe cannot build a firewall around its economy; we must champion an investment-focused approach that attracts global capital and top-tier international talent. By rejecting protectionist ""sovereignty requirements"" in favor of openness, we ensure Europe has the resources and skills, both homegrown and global, to build and deliver world-class infrastructure and services. 3. Delivering ""Real-Economy"" Impact. Finally, the Council must ensure the EU moves from ""regulating"" to ""enabling."" Whether amending the Cybersecurity Act, Digital Networks Act or Cloud and AI Development Act or modernizing procurement, the test must be: Do these proposals lower costs and speed up deployment? By prioritizing risk-based, technical standards over political barriers, Ireland can ensure that European businesses access the best-in-class technologies they need to compete, regardless of origin."

Citizens feel ownership when they see that their input has a tangible impact on downstream policy. Workday suggests a multi-faceted approach: From Consultation to Co-Creation The Department should treat this consultation as the start of a conversation, not a one-off exercise. Following this process, we recommend publishing a clear roadmap showing how specific stakeholder contributions shaped the final priorities. This transparency demonstrates that the agenda for economic growth is not imposed from Brussels, but co-created in Dublin. When citizens and businesses see their input shaping the framework for future prosperity, they will feel a direct stake in the Presidency’s success. The ""Skills Passport"" The Presidency should communicate how EU membership is evolving into an opportunity engine for people. By championing a ""Skills-First"" policy, Ireland can demonstrate that the EU is the guarantor of a citizen's ability to work, learn, and prosper anywhere in the region. It is about driving productivity and removing barriers so that every Irish citizen can apply their talents where they are most valuable. The goal is to evolve the vision of the EU to be seen as the vehicle that maximizes personal potential and career mobility. Enabling competitiveness while delivering protections. The Presidency must demonstrate that the EU Single Market delivers both protection and prosperity. We recommend clearly communicating that simplifying regulations, like the GDPR or AI Act, does not mean an erosion of rights, but a necessary step to unlock business growth and job creation. By focusing on smart implementation that reduces friction while maintaining high standards and trust, Ireland can prove to citizens that the EU is both the safest place to live and the easiest place to innovate."

We believe this event will be the defining moment to shift the European narrative from regulating AI to adopting AI. As a strategic partner, Workday offers its full support to help the Presidency move this Summit beyond a policy debate and transform it into a showcase of ""Real-World AI"" that drives Productivity and Economic Growth. A ""Living Lab"" for the Delegation With the AI Office of Ireland set to be fully operational by 2026, the Summit is the perfect vehicle to show the world that Ireland is the ""AI Capital of Europe."" Workday is ready to support this agenda. Our newly announced €175 million AI Centre of Excellence in Dublin will be fully operational during the Presidency. We propose utilizing this facility, along with our Customer Experience Centre, as a ""living lab"" or site visit for Summit delegates. We can provide EU leaders with first-hand demonstrations of how responsible AI agents are being built, tested, and deployed from Dublin to the world, offering a tangible proof-point of Ireland’s innovation ecosystem. Showcasing a Blueprint for Upskilling The Summit must also highlight the ""human"" side of Competitiveness. Workday is eager to share the learnings from our partnerships with TU Dublin, Trinity College and Skillnet, through which we have already certified over 800 workmates in disciplines like applied machine learning and AI strategy. We believe this industry-led upskilling model is a blueprint for the rest of Europe. We would welcome the opportunity to showcase this collaboration at the Summit as a practical, scalable example of how member states can build an ""AI-Ready"" workforce today. From Act to Action By highlighting these success stories - from multinational R&D hubs to indigenous skills partnerships - the Summit can prove that a high-trust regulatory environment is compatible with high-speed innovation.

On the EU budget side, the Irish Presidency should highlight the strategic value of having a Common and Strong budget dedicated to agriculture, leveraging both sovereignty and sustainability. It will take the role as Council President as a critical moment in the negotiation, with the opportunity to reverse the current course of action. As the US is announcing budget increases for farmers, the EU is cutting its CAP budget. A renewed ambition for the CAP should be reflected in more ambition negotiating box of the MFF when it comes to the CAP and for clearer earmarking dedicated to agriculture programmes in the competitiveness fund as well. 65billions EUR are missing in the current MFF proposal. We also expect the Irish presidency to play a key role in improving the CAP reform proposal as such making sure that the level playing field is insure and that farmers get the support they need to deliver food security to our society. We expect progresses on market management tools, crisis reserve and further protection of meat denominations in the context of the new CMO reform, on the top of the one that is currently being discussed. On the international front, a serious discussion should take place building on the past presidency related to the reciprocity when it comes to trade agreements as well as the reinforcing of controls at EU borders. The EU cannot imports products that are not allowed to be produced in the EU. This basic principle should be the norm, not the exception."

Although the sector is not a fully developed one in Ireland we do have massive potential and plans for the bio-economy. The area of water resillience is getting more and more important across Europe and there needs to be a dicussion on how we can best manage in areas and sectors where there will be more pressure and how we can move and incentivise production in areas that have less drought pressures. When it comes to nutrition, the Irish presidency should be an opportunity to rebalance the debate on the need to well-balanced diet and education after a danish presidency focusing on synthetic meat, lab-grown alternatives and alternative protein sources. Rebalancing the debate highlighting clearly that livestock is an opportunity for the EU would be a welcome initiative, including via a boost to promotion schemes. On sector specific issues, there will be an important momentum for the livestock sector with the presentation just before the Irish presidency of the EU livestock strategy. We consider that the European Commission should set up a high level group on livestock to give back visibility to the sector. In addition, under the IE presidency, some are expecting the presidency to help finding a deal on the sensitive issue of animal transport. The European Commission is also supposed to present animal welfare initiatives on farms."

Ireland’s presidency offers a opertunity to highlight the work of farmers for citizens of the EU that are not directly connected with Agriculture. We need to take advantage of the digital age and use more audio and video platforms to highlight the work of the EU on the ground and what it means for different individuels, what tangabile changes have been made from involvement in EU schemes. Irish farmers have been to the fore in breeding more efficient livestock that is recognised as such around Europe either as live exported animals or prime cuts of beef.

Irish evidence makes the case for urgent, EU-level action: The Central Statistics Office reports that 59% of gay/lesbian people, 55% of bisexual people, and 46% of trans and non-binary people in Ireland experienced discrimination in the previous two years (CSO, Equality and Discrimination Survey 2024). BeLonG To’s national data shows over one in four LGBTQ+ people have been physically attacked, and 72% verbally abused, because of their identity (LGBTQ+ Life in Ireland 2023/24). In schools, 49% of LGBTQ+ students face identity-based bullying, 76% feel unsafe, and 26% avoid school to escape mistreatment (BeLonG To & GLSEN, School Climate Survey Ireland 2022). Based on this evidence, Ireland should prioritise: 1. Democracy, Rule of Law & Fundamental Rights The rise in hate crime and civic exclusion across Europe - echoed in Ireland’s own data - requires coordinated EU protection of minority rights, safety, and civic space. 2. A Socially Inclusive & Healthy Europe High bullying rates and worsening mental health among LGBTQ+ youth (BeLonG To, Being LGBTQI+ in Ireland 2024) demonstrate the need for strong EU leadership on wellbeing, inclusive education, and mental-health support. 3. Youth Empowerment & Digital Safety Irish LGBTQ+ youth experience disproportionate levels of online harassment (BeLonG To, 2023). Ireland’s digital-regulation leadership positions it to advance EU protections. 4.

Mutual Recognition of Parenthood Irish LGBTQ+ families still face barriers moving across the EU. Children’s rights organisations, including Irish LGBT+ family advocacy groups, consistently highlight this risk. 3. Hate Crime & Hate Speech Recorded hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ people have increased sharply (Gardaí; BeLonG To, 2023). Ireland should support EU-wide minimum standards for hate-crime recording, data quality, and victim support. 4. Digital Safety & Online Harm Reduction Irish studies show LGBTQ+ youth are disproportionately exposed to online harassment (BeLonG To, 2023). Ireland is well placed to lead on platform accountability and child-safety measures. 5. Education, Youth & Mental Health With 76% of LGBTQ+ students reporting they do not feel safe at school (School Climate Survey, 2022), Ireland should push for EU action on teacher training, anti-bullying frameworks, and youth mental-health strategies. 6.

Decent Work. Remote jobs operate on timezone, not geography. When a company hires for EMEA hours, European workers are the talent pool. A software developer in Donegal, a marketing manager in Calabria, and a customer support lead in rural Poland can all apply for the same role. This is fundamentally different from traditional employment, where jobs are tied to specific locations. By remote employment, we mean fully remote salaried roles where employer and employee are in fixed tax jurisdictions but not co-located. It is this category — location-agnostic employment generating full employer taxes — that offers the greatest policy opportunity. The opportunity is significant: over 100,000 remote jobs are advertised monthly across the European Economic Area. But demand far exceeds supply. Eurofound's 2024 Living and Working in the EU survey shows 74% of EU workers want to work remotely at least several times a month. Yet fully remote positions have dropped from 24% to 14% since 2022. This is a supply problem. Ireland is well positioned to lead on this. We already have one of the EU's highest remote work participation rates and a proven track record in targeted job creation. Crucially, growing the supply of remote jobs at EU level grows supply for all of us. When more companies hire location-agnostic roles across Europe, workers in every member state benefit. The EU already helps countries compete for jobs. Regional State Aid Guidelines allow member states to offer incentives for investment in disadvantaged areas. Structural Funds provide direct support for job creation. But these tools assume physical investment — a factory, an office. Remote jobs don't fit. A job performed from an assisted area generates the same tax revenue, the same local spend, the same regional benefit. But current rules don't recognise it. This agenda aligns directly with the Strategic Agenda 2024-2029's commitment to a prosperous and competitive Europe that advances the social dimension. We propose two priorities: first, increase the supply of remote jobs available to EU workers; second, empower each member state to compete for those jobs. Ireland's Presidency should pursue Council Conclusions on Remote Employment — establishing political direction and inviting the Commission to develop coordinated action across EPSCO, REGIO, COMPET, and digital policy files."
427,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/4a0a40ba/Grow_Remote_-_Submission_427.docx,Grow Remote,,,,2,"To deliver on the two priorities outlined above, we propose action in three areas: growing the supply of remote jobs available to EU workers, addressing structural barriers that prevent regional policy from recognising remote employment, and building the skills base for distributed work. Increase the Supply of Remote Jobs Open to EU Workers Growing the supply of remote jobs available to EU workers requires action on two fronts: targeting employers outside Europe with a proposition to hire across the EU — positioning Europe's skilled, remote-ready workforce as an attractive talent pool; and providing supports for EU companies to adopt remote working models, expanding the roles they advertise as location-agnostic. Council Conclusions should invite the Commission to develop an EU-level strategy to engage international remote-first employers, support domestic companies in transitioning to distributed models, and track remote job availability across the EEA. More roles open to EU workers means more opportunities for every member state. Address Structural Barriers in Regional Aid Current Regional Aid Guidelines (2022-2027) illustrate a broader challenge. They allow member states to fund 10-70% of wage costs for jobs created in assisted areas — but only where the employer has a physical establishment there. This made sense when jobs required buildings. Remote employment changes the equation: a worker in an assisted area generates the same tax revenue and local spend regardless of where their employer is based. Council Conclusions could invite the Commission to explore how regional incentive frameworks might recognise remote employment — for example, whether home office investment or hub presence could qualify, or whether worker tax residence could determine eligibility. This would sit alongside, not replace, existing location-based schemes. Build a Skilled, Remote-Ready Workforce Remote work capability is an employment skill: individual productivity, distributed team management, and digital collaboration. We recommend developing EU-level standards for remote work competencies and expanding ESF+, Erasmus+, and Digital Europe calls for worker and manager capability programmes. This would complement the Commission's Fair Labour Mobility Package and skills portability initiative already planned for 2026."

Remote employment is that modern employment: secure income, full employer taxes, career progression, and benefits, with time in your community. That combination is rare. Remote work removes location as a barrier, and that changes what's possible for people, businesses, and the places they live. People Eurostat data (2023) shows median equivalised net income in EU rural areas (€18,352) remains 13% below city levels (€21,136). Remote employment offers a mechanism to narrow this gap by decoupling quality work from urban location. On Inishturk Island, population 60, there are eight or nine full-time jobs. Joe, a Grow Remote member, previously faced leaving his family for the mainland every week. Remote work enabled him to take a role with Meta from home. He now leads the local Grow Remote chapter, working to ensure other island communities can access the same opportunities. This is what becomes possible when we actively steer this form of employment rather than letting it happen by chance. Businesses Evidence consistently shows remote work supports business performance. BCG research (2024) found fully flexible companies grew revenues 1.7x faster than mandate-driven peers. Gallup's Global Workplace Study (2025) shows exclusively remote employees are the most engaged group globally at 31%. CIPD Ireland (2025) reports 75% of employers say remote work improved both productivity and wellbeing. The challenge is not whether remote works — it's ensuring businesses have the skills to manage distributed teams effectively. Shared EU standards for remote work competencies would help, particularly for SMEs. Communities Remote workers bring both income and time back to their communities. Without commuting, they gain hours each week and save an estimated €6,000 annually — money that gets spent locally rather than on transport and city-centre costs. Volunteer Ireland reports 1-in-4 remote workers donate time to local causes, filling gaps in volunteer rosters that shift-bound workers cannot. Research shows for every remote job in a community, 0.7 of another job is created through secondary spend. This is economic development without requiring businesses to relocate — income flowing into regions that current policy struggles to reach."

Article 3 TEU commits the Union to full employment, territorial cohesion, and solidarity among Member States. The European Pillar of Social Rights sets a target of 78% employment by 2030. SDG 10 commits to reduced inequalities within and among countries. Cohesion Policy exists to close regional disparities. Eurostat (2024) shows 26.7 million people in the EU have an unmet supply of employment — underemployed, available but not seeking, or given up looking. Many are carers, people with disabilities, or live in regions where local jobs don't exist. Remote employment can reach them. But there's a structural mismatch. Location-indifferent employers have no reason to engage with local job market infrastructure — recruiters, job fairs, regional advertising. Supply and demand exist but nothing connects them. Jobs flow to whoever finds them, not to where they're needed. No country can fix this mismatch alone. It requires EU-level coordination to target location-indifferent employers, support companies adopting remote models, and connect workers in assisted regions to these opportunities. Council Conclusions would establish the political commitment to act. Ireland has built the infrastructure, training programmes, and evidence base. We can bring solutions to the table. Citizens seeing decent jobs become accessible in regions the EU has pledged to support — that's EU membership delivering on its own promises."

Conservative estimates show that when Ireland wins 1,000 remote jobs, that generates €10.8 million in employer and employee taxes and €20 million in GDP annually. Those jobs come from an EU-wide pool. It's in Ireland's direct interest to grow the top of that funnel. More remote jobs at EU level means more opportunities for Irish workers to compete for. Every member state has the same incentive. Yet so far, Europe has had no strategic response to remote employment. Policy discussions conflate digital nomads, hybrid arrangements, and fully remote salaried work — categories with fundamentally different implications. The opportunity we describe requires focus. Ireland has shown leadership: state-funded training programmes reaching thousands of people, 400+ Connected Hubs providing workspace outside cities, broadband now reaching 98% of premises. These are foundations to build on — but no country can grow the supply of remote jobs alone. No one is currently targeting location-indifferent employers or actively growing the supply of remote roles available to European workers. Council Conclusions on Remote Employment would create what's missing: political commitment to increase the supply, empower each member state to compete for them, and invite the Commission to develop the mechanisms to deliver both.

A Knowledge-Rich, Skilled and Innovative Europe Europe’s future resilience depends on its capacity to educate, upskill and empower its people. As home to world-leading research centres and a recognised leader in teaching and learning, UCC stresses the importance of positioning education, research, innovation and entrepreneurship as central drivers of Europe’s competitiveness and cohesion. This theme will underpin promotion of the European Education Area, strengthen the European Research Area, and address current and emerging skills shortages in areas including teaching, digital literacy, green technologies, and healthcare. Ireland can champion a Europe that invests in talent, creativity, and research and innovation excellence. 2. A Sustainable, Climate-Resilient Green Europe UCC is internationally recognised as a sustainability leader—the world’s first Green Flag University and a consistent top performer in global sustainability rankings. Drawing from this expertise, Ireland should advance a Presidency that accelerates the green transition through research-informed climate action. Priorities should include biodiversity restoration, renewable energy transformation (particularly offshore and ocean-based energy), circular economy expansion, food security and climate adaptation. This reflects deep Irish strengths in marine, agricultural, food, energy and environmental research and aligns with UCC’s own commitments under its Sustainability and Climate Action Plan. 3. An Inclusive, Healthy and Socially Cohesive Europe UCC’s values of equality, diversity and inclusion provide a strong foundation for promoting a Presidency focused on social cohesion and wellbeing. This theme should prioritise reducing educational disadvantage, supporting intercultural inclusion, promoting gender equality, strengthening public health resilience, promoting equity and ensuring that communities most affected by digitalisation and decarbonisation are supported through Just Transition measures."

Support Lifelong Learning and Skills Development Working with universities, employers and civil society, the Presidency can promote EU-wide skills initiatives that support workers, students, and communities. This includes micro-credential frameworks, upskilling for green and digital jobs, upskilling for working in the European institutions and improved pathways into higher education. 3. Enable Sustainable Business and Community Transitions Policies that simplify access to EU funding, reduce administrative burdens, and invest in circular and low-carbon innovation will benefit SMEs and local communities. 4. Foster Trust, Engagement and Participation The Presidency should model transparency and accessibility by actively engaging youth, educators, researchers, cultural organizations and community groups among other stakeholders.

If the objective is to roll out an overall policy approach that puts focus on a human-centric vision for the EU, we believe that Ireland should put culture at the heart of all high-level thematic priorities. Such approach corresponds with the rationale behind the recently adopted Cultural Compass, the objective of which is to put culture as a guiding force for our future-oriented vision in all EU policy domains. As such, focus should be put on performers as well as those who benefit from it socially, culturally and economically. ° A free and democratic Europe Democracy lies at the basis of our culture and culture lies at the basis of our democracy. By putting focus on the role of culture the Irish Presidency puts focus on the first priority of the Strategic Agenda: upholding European values within the Union, promoting our cultural diversity and heritage and confronting tech giants with their responsibility in safeguarding these values online. Protection of human creativity in the development and use of AI Address the importance of safeguarding human artistic contribution in the face of advancing AI technologies. AI must evolve in a way that puts humans at its heart, and which respects fundamental rights (including copyright) and cultural diversity. In particular, care should be taken to ensure that large companies (frequently from outside the EU) are not permitted to establish unreasonable commercial practices that do not respect these principles. ° A prosperous and competitive Europe When working towards reinforcement of our sovereignty in strategic sectors to make Europe a technological and industrial powerhouse, while promoting an open economy, the cultural and creative sector should be regarded as a strategic and sensitive sector in which the EU needs to build up our own capacity. Artists, often SMEs, need harmonisation of their working environment to be able to play the role they need to play in the single (digital and platform based) market. Fair and sustainable conditions in Europe’s cultural and creative sectors This would entail a thorough examination of how existing Union frameworks are functioning in practice and whether they continue to deliver balanced outcomes for all parties involved in the creative sector. It should evaluate measures necessary to ensure that Europe’s cultural ecosystem remains capable of adapting to new types of use. ° Living up to our values at global level If there is one sector in which the EU can play the role of global powerhouse, it is the cultural sector. The Irish Presidency should apply the overall objective of the EU to strive for a reformed multilateral system, making it more inclusive and more effective, to culture. Strengthening cultural rights through international legal frameworks This would acknowledge the importance of international norm-setting in supporting Europe’s creative sector, including engagement with entities such as WIPO, on both existing and future initiatives."

Continue the work of the previous Presidencies in striving towards an EU status of the artist. While obtaining this objective requires work within the competence of the Member States, a coordinating role within the Council is paramount. Ireland's recent initiatives in this regard, often presented as best practices, provide the ideal basis to play a leading and guiding role in strengthening basic social protection for performers. Apart from proper social protection, performers also need economic protection. It should be recognised that unpaid exploitations are equal to unpaid work. A review of the existing copyright and related rights framework should remain at the top of the Council agenda, and particularly the Commission’s review of Directive (EU) 2019/790 (the “CDSM directive”). It is anticipated that work on the review will be well underway by the second half of 2026. The Presidency should ensure a thorough review is carried out in a timely manner and that contractual imbalances such as buy-out practices are properly addressed. This could be achieved by insisting on regular updates within Council working parties and ensuring that Member States cooperate fully in this initiative. Concerning Artificial Intelligence, the Presidency should prioritise respect for human creativity and continue the work started under the Danish Presidency searching for possible approaches to remuneration. Commercial practices are evolving where music, TV and films are being used without the consent of the relevant performers. GenAI companies like Suno, Udio and Anthropic have been sued for committing copyright infringement on a vast scale. At the same time a licensing practice is evolving where the human contributions of performers are licensed to these GenAI companies by large corporations such as major record labels with no consent being obtained by, and no remuneration paid to, performers. Addressing these matters will help prepare the Council to respond to developments that are already affecting the development of a fair and human-centric cultural environment. Personality rights also deserve close consideration. Recent recommendations to the Irish Government have proposed statutory protection for voice, likeness and identity, and legislative work on similar measures is currently progressing in Denmark. Personality rights are not harmonised throughout the EU. Examining this issue at Council level would allow Member States to exchange on national approaches and consider whether harmonised protection at Union level would be appropriate. The 2011 Term Extension Directive increased the term of protection for phonograms from 50 to 70 years thus giving musicians an additional 20 years protection. In its recent review of the directive the Commission chose not to recommend providing a similar level of protection for the audiovisual sector thus perpetuating the discrimination that has existed for the past 15 years. This anomaly should be re-examined, especially in the context of older films and TV being used for GenAI purposes."

Ensuring that the CDSM Directive (and in particular the Member States’ obligation to ensure “appropriate and proportionate remuneration”) is taken seriously within the Council - and that Member States contribute evidence on whether it has improved remuneration in practice – would help to maintain viable careers in music, film and television. Ensuring that this legislation is implemented effectively supports individual artists, SMEs (the most common form of business within the cultural sector), local venues, etc. and has a beneficial societal impact. A clear decision by the Presidency to treat AI uses of performances as a human-centric issue, rather than a purely technological one, would have a direct impact on fairness in the market and bring scrutiny to new licensing practices that are emerging, often without the knowledge or consent of the artists whose work is involved. Work which recognises this reality and explores conditions for personality rights, remuneration, consent and control would protect those whose performances contribute so much to the EU’s cultural diversity and would support responsible business practices in the development of AI. The cultural sector is by definition an international sector. International work should be a priority for the Presidency with a specific focus on defending EU cultural values at global level. As such, the Presidency should make it a point of honour to end 2026 with the ratification by the EU of the 2012 Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances. Multilateralism can only work if leaders lead by example. This approach should also be pursued in ongoing discussions in the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights. With the right coordination, the Presidency can steer the presence of the EU Member States in more than one regional group to push through those agenda items that work towards an effective global implementation of the international legal framework. In addition, the Presidency should use the status of the EU as a global cultural powerhouse by putting the strengthening of the rights of performers at the heart of any Free Trade Agreement. The EU should use its economic strength to push countries to increase – not diminish - the protection of citizens, especially those in the cultural sector who are particularly vulnerable. The role of cultural freedom in a democratic society should be promoted globally and be at the heart of bilateral and multilateral collaborations. Ensuring that the cultural sector remains commercially and economically viable, but respects and adequately values the contribution that humans make, will undoubtedly have a positive societal impact."

They should be felt by them. The EU’s legislative framework and the protection it provides to individuals (and all sectors of the European community) is something to be immensely proud of. The fact that its laws frequently contain a provision requiring that the impact of a law be reviewed after a specific period of time serves to strengthen the benefits it provides. In order to ensure that individuals feel they benefit from the laws that their EU legislature created, it is essential that these reviews are conducted in a meaningful and timely manner. If the Presidency can show that it has endeavoured to ensure this is done it will demonstrate the values of living in a democratically elected society where laws designed to protect citizens are monitored and upheld."

Denmark has just done so by placing its proposal regarding the protection of performers against AI-generated infringements of their voice, image, and likeness on the Council's agenda. Ireland will certainly be expected to take the lead in work on the social status of artists (see our answer to question 2), something that is a key pillar of the recently adopted Cultural Compass. But other recent developments in draft Irish legislation (specifically the Copyright and Related Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025) also aim to set an example that ought to be replicated at EU level. The draft legislation is designed to ensure that remuneration from such sources as radio broadcasting is split equally between musicians and record labels. Although this may seem an incredibly obvious principle, it is missing from the legislation of many EU countries. Moreover, it will help the EU approach the much-debated RAAP-case from a different angle and focus on the actual problem to be solved. Minor clarifications to the draft Bill are required. In particular, there is a need for clarity on the exercise and administration of this right to remuneration, to show how the equal split principle would work on the ground. Further, Member States should be encouraged to design systems that avoid conflicts of interest between record labels and performers. Finally, performers’ CMOs should have an equal voice wherever the right is exercised jointly with record labels. These issues and others are clarified in detail in a recent AEPO-ARTIS letter to Minister Niamh Smyth of 4 December 2025. Subject to the provisos above, recommending that other EU Member States follow Ireland’s example would be a “quick win” that would be immensely appreciated by Irish and other EU performers like."

This includes addressing the social disadvantage and the needs of older people, so that the EU is a community where every person is valued, cared for and supported at every stage of their lives. Ireland should continue its longstanding tradition of championing and defending human rights, which has been a cornerstone of its foreign policy and of its previous stints on both the UN Security Council and the UN Human Rights Council in 2015. Its current campaign for renewed membership on the UN Human Rights Council for 2027-29, illustrates this continued commitment. It should respond to the increasing cost of living, leading to growing rates of homelessness and poverty across the EU. A central priority should be delivering a coordinated European approach to housing, based on the commitment by all 27 Member States to work towards ending homelessness by 2030 as part of the Lisbon Declaration, and aligned with the forthcoming European Affordable Housing and anti-poverty plans. This starts with the recognition that housing is first and foremost a home and a basic human right, not a financial asset. This has also expressed by our colleagues in the *Irish Homeless Policy Group (IHPG*), of which we are members. *The IHPG is a coalition of organisations working on the frontline of Ireland’s housing and homelessness crisis. Members include groups that provide direct housing support, advocacy, policy research, and legal interventions for those experiencing or at risk of homelessness, committed to ending homelessness. Effective implementation of the new EU Anti-Poverty Strategy currently being developed, should also be a key priority. Guaranteeing access to essential services like housing, healthcare, and education, to all, particularly the most marginalised, including ethnic minorities and addressing the intersectional dimensions of poverty, those related to gender, age, disability, and discrimination is crucial. This should be done from a community development approach, in conjunction with those with lived and diverse experiences of poverty and social exclusion."

COPE Galway supports and would like to reiterate the Simon Communities of Ireland’s call for the Irish Presidency to table a draft Council Recommendation on ending homelessness, for adoption under the Presidency in 2026. We agree that there is clear institutional momentum in the EU and an appetite for a Council Recommendation on ending homelessness. As per the Sinon Communities of Ireland’s submission, which we fully support: In February 2024, the Belgian Presidency held a Ministerial Conference on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH). The event was an opportunity to discuss efforts to eradicate homelessness in the EU by 2030, a commitment all 27 EU countries agreed to work towards with the signing of the Lisbon Declaration in 2021. A report from the event noted a growing will among member states for a Council Recommendation on eradicating homelessness, recognising the urgency of coordinated EU-level action and the value of the Housing First. In March 2025, the European Parliament welcomed intentions for a Council Recommendation on homelessness as part of a resolution on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination: Employment and Social Priorities for 2025 (§16). The Council Conclusions on the future European Affordable Housing Plan, published in November 2025, proposes “stronger cooperation at EU level on homelessness, building on the work of and further strengthening the European Platform on Combating Homelessness and housing-led policies such as the Housing First Principle. The Housing Advisory Board, chaired by Eammon Ryan, recently published its recommendations to the European Commission, which included that the Commission propose, and Council adopt by 2026, a “Recommendation on Homelessness that transforms the Lisbon Declaration into a governance framework at national level and a plan for European-level action to support an monitor progress” (pg. 14). Reiterating Ireland’s commitment to ending homelessness by 2030 in the Delivering Homes, Building Communities housing plan. In addition, the Presidency presents an ideal occasion to make strides towards gender equality, Europe’s unfinished promise. Gender inequality is the cause of all violence against women and ccultural/societal violence, in turn, is a social mechanism that helps keeps women in a subordinate position to men and societal change requires reaching people’s hearts and minds with new understandings of justice and fairness. Ireland should encourage the wider use of gender mainstreaming methods and tools across EU structures and departments such as gender budgeting and gender impact assessments in line with the principles and best practices in our own recently published ‘National Strategy for Women and Girls 2025–2030.’ The EU’s Work-Life Balance Directive (2019/1158), for example, is designed to promote gender equality by legislating the equal sharing of caring responsibilities. This marks a milestone in European policymaking by creating new regulations to promote gender equality. Ireland can further the human right of gender equality during the Presidency by promoting adherence to this Directive, and leading on its implementation, and that of other related EU directives, such as that on pay transparency. Other key actions that should be concentrated on include championing efforts to end gender-based violence and fostering international cooperation to ensure strong gender equality policies across Europe. Ireland should also champion effective response to the scourge of digital violence, effecting women and girls across Europe. November 2025 data from an EU-wide Council of European Municipalities and Regions survey stated that around 32% of women political representatives in Europe report experiencing violence. Nearly one in three of these facing cyberviolence, including threats, harassment and abuse on digital platforms. Ireland has a clear record in support of gender equality initiatives, such as during its tenure on the UN Security Council and its consistent support for the Women, Peace and Security agenda. This should be continued during the Irish EU Presidency."

The cost of providing emergency accommodation, crisis supports, and health services for persons experiencing homelessness is substantial. Investing in prevention and permanent solutions is far more sustainable and cost-effective. Experiencing homelessness can have multiple negative impacts, including adverse effects on physical health, mental health, and overall wellbeing. For children, experiencing homelessness can negatively affect development, cognitive functioning, participation in education, and opportunities later in life. By investing in early intervention, family support, and housing-led responses, these long-term harms, can be prevented and community wellbeing strengthened. This applies equally to older people renting and at risk of homelessness"

We agree with our colleague in the Irish Homeless Policy Group, that Ireland should adopt an accessible communication strategy, that should be designed and co-created in partnership with Disabled Persons’ Organisations, civil society groups, ethic and other minorities and representative community organisations to ensure they reflect lived realities and meet all accessibility needs. Outreach efforts must be deliberately targeted toward those that have historically been underrepresented in EU-level conversations, ensuring that the benefits of the Presidency are shared widely and that the Presidency itself reflects the diversity of the people it serves."

The establishment of this priority can be directly linked to Ireland’s pioneering role in modern-language education, the celebration of whose founding moment coincides with Ireland’s Presidency of the Council In 1776, Chairs of Modern Languages in French, German, Italian and Spanish were officially established in Trinity College Dublin. These were the first such Chairs in these islands (the first Chair of Romance Languages in Oxford University would not be created until 1909, and the Drapers Professorship of French in Cambridge University was launched in 1919) and in the case of the Chairs of French and German, are the oldest continuous Chairs in these languages in the world. If it was highly unusual for a British university to provide modern language instruction before the middle of the nineteenth century, for Ireland’s university sector it became the general rule. By 1850 all Irish universities officially offered modern languages. The Presidency of the Council presents a unique opportunity to leverage Ireland’s ground-breaking initiatives in modern language education in the Anglophone world to promote multilingual education both internally on the island of Ireland and throughout the European Union. Three main motivating factors justify the adoption of multilingual education as a thematic priority, these are political, social and psychological. Politicially, the Anglophone Order that dominated Western Europe for much of second half of the twentieth century has gradually begun to unravel in the new century. The advent of Brexit, the rise of American populism and the emergence of a multipolar world mean that the future is inescapbly multilingual. When Anglophone spaces become increasingly unstable or unwelcoming, then any informed policy, whether in foreign affairs, trade or research, must look to other language spaces both with a view to forming potential partnerships and with an eye to doing things differently. Learning a modern language fundamentally alters an individual’s regime of attention but one could equally argue that this utopian promise extends to a whole society. Regimes of attention are hopelessly compromised by a failure to engage more fully with foreign languages. The solutions, the perspectives, the insights to contend with major social problems available in other languages are, as a result, often ignored. A healthy pluralism in the public sphere is vitally dependent on expanding the range of policy and societal options that learning foreign languages can offer. Socially, as societies across the European become more multi-ethnic and mulitilingual, the question of social cohesion becomes more pressing. Linguistic foreignness, difference or alterity are no longer elements without or external to European societies but an intrinsic part of them. If respectful communication is central to social cohesion, there can be no long lasting or meaningful form of cohesion if all the forms of communication in European societies are not taken into consideration. Psychologically, learning languages is a public health issue with decisive consequences for individual wellbeing in the context of Europe’s ageing population. Research carried out by the School of Psychology in Trinity College Dublin has conclusively shown that speaking multiple languages can slow the biological processes of aging and protect against age-related decline."

An embrace of multilingual education as a priority by the Irish Presidency would turn the foundational multilingualism of the EU into an active force for political, economic, and social good in European societies. Actively engaging with Europe’s language diversity would have positive impacts in a number of different areas: Businesses: In a world of growing economic uncertainty, where traditional markets are increasingly subject to the vagaries of ideological choices, a resilient business base requires the capacity to increase access to previously underexplored or underdeveloped markets. These markets are overwhelmingly situated outside the Anglophone world. Any successful or sustainable penetration of markets entails speaking the language of the customer, whether within Europe or beyond. The broader the range of language knowledge, the greater the reach of business opportunity. Poor language skills and lacklustre cultural adaptability are distinct liabilities in a foreign trade dependent economic bloc. If Ireland’s knowledge of English has often acted as a disincentive for learning foreign languages, the problem for many EU member states is that an excessive reliance on English as a second language leaves them equally exposed on the languages front. Emphasis on the importance of foreign languages as a life-skill, as a promoter of cultural awareness, and as a means of enhancing the value of other skills—be they intellectual or vocational—can only have positive outcomes in terms of the diversification of trade outlets and the maximization of economic opportunity. Communities: In an uncertain global context, and in the resurgence of divisive populisms that excessively privilege narrow interests, the acquisition of foreign languages becomes a way to substitute curiosity for condemnation and partnership for paranoia. As Jacques Delors once observed, you cannot fall in love with a market. Creating a sustained sense of shared European identity cannot be based solely on transactional self interest, there must be a feeling of deeper engagement with one’s fellow Europeans. Languages become a privileged form of access to the history, society, and art forms of different European societies and open up a wealth of experiences that give substance and permanence to the civic experiences of Europeanness. Learning modern languages is a critical factor in binding communities together at both national and supra-national level. People: A general aim of the Euorpean Union is to promote the well-being of its citizens. Dr Augustín Ibáñez, Professor of Global Brain Health in Trinity College Dublin, in an extensive cross-sectional and longtitudinal study carried out across 27 European countries found that multilingualism was a key factor in preventing accelerated aging. The study found that individuals from countries where people commonly speak at least one additional language were 2.17 times less likely to experience accelerated aging, while monolinguals were over twice as likely to show early aging patterns. These effects remained significant even after adjusting for linguistic, social, physical, and sociopolitical factors. The protective impact of multilingualism was consistent across both cross-sectional analyses, reflecting current differences in aging, and longitudinal analyses, showing that multilingualism predicts a lower risk of accelerated aging over time. The long-term health impacts of modern language learning would be demonstrably beneficial for Europe’s population."

The ability to develop human contact, acquire historical knowledge, appreciate cultural practices (music, food, performance arts) and engage in resilient forms of educational and economic relationships (research, business) is greatly enhanced by the knowledge of another’s language. The notion of hospitality is crucial here. Learning the language(s) of citizens of other Member States is a way of welcoming the cultures and languages of others into one’s society. This form of recognition not only leads to an enrichment of the lives of European citizens but it creates a sense of reciprocal obligation (I recognise you because you have recognized me) which not only binds citizens closer together but makes them feel that European identities are concrete, communicative realities rather than distant, institutional abstractions. The sense of ownership of the European project can only be intensified by the regular engagement with and the practice of the language(s) of other Europeans, a concrete enactment of the EU motto, ‘Unity in Diversity.’ A largely unexplored resource in terms of public representations of the European ideal is the extraordinary range of languages (twenty-four in all) that have official, working status in the EU. Each of these languages carries an incalculably rich body of story, song, insight and expression that, in many instances, is largely unknown to citizens from the different EU Member States. By making this overlooked treasure, a key thematic priority of te Irish Presidency of the Council, the Irish Presidency would highlight the immense possibilities and boundless interest of intense language engagement across the Members States of the Union. Ireland’s historical commitment to modern language learning, the bilingual nature of the State and the strength of Ireland’s international reputation in the area of literary expression makes Ireland a credible advocate of multlingualism as a thematic priority of the EU Presidency with clear, tangible outcomes for citizens, communities and businesses in the Union. The Trinity Long Room Hub working in conjunction with the School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies and the Trinity Centre for Literary and Cultural Translation can provide the expertise and tools that would give expression and substance to an active campaign centred around European multlingualism. For the College, there would be no more fitting way to honour 250 years of involvement in modern language education in Europe than to become an active partner with the State in promoting multilingualism as an active, life-long dimension to the lives of European citizens. The mental health benefits of multilingualism are a further element in making intelligible the real world impact of a renewed commitment in public policy to the foundational multilingualism of European institutions."

Global instability and declining economic competitiveness, as highlighted by Mario Draghi, underscore the need for the EU to harness the full power of the Single Market to drive growth, attract investment, and strengthen its global role. Ireland’s Presidency should therefore be defined by a future-oriented vision for the EU, underpinned by three overarching themes aimed at fostering economic competitiveness: simplification of the regulatory framework, driving forward and completing the Savings and Investment Union (SIU), and strengthening and harmonising the EU’s financial architecture. Driving Forward and Completing the Savings and Investment Union (SIU) The EU faces a significant investment gap—estimated at €800bn annually—to meet its objectives for decarbonisation, digitalisation, and defence. Despite high savings rates, much capital remains underutilised, and the EU lags behind other regions in innovation and capital market development. Advancing the SIU is essential to closing this gap and restoring the EU’s global competitiveness. Ireland should use its Presidency to drive forward the SIU strategy, developing deeper and more liquid capital markets, breaking down internal barriers, and boosting retail investor participation. Key actions include harmonising supervisory outcomes, removing barriers to cross-border investment, revitalising the securitisation market, and promoting financial literacy across Member States Simplification of the Regulatory Framework. The EU’s financial services sector is constrained by a complex and fragmented regulatory environment that hinders global competitiveness. Ireland’s Presidency presents a critical opportunity to champion a legislative agenda focused on proportionality and simplicity. Regulations should be tailored to the size, complexity, and systemic risk of financial institutions, reducing unnecessary administrative burdens and unlocking capital for productive investment. By advocating for a smarter, simpler, and more agile regulatory environment, Ireland can help lead the EU toward a more competitive and integrated financial market. This includes revising and simplifying the macroprudential framework, reviewing the methodology for identifying systemically important institutions, and advancing a dedicated regime for investment firms. 3. Strengthening and Harmonising Financial Architecture. To realise the full potential of the Single Market, the EU must strengthen and harmonise its financial architecture. This includes further supervisory convergence to tackle internal barriers, harmonising insolvency law, and advancing a common EU-wide legal framework for capital markets. Enhanced EU-level supervision of systemic market infrastructures should streamline existing processes and ensure consistent regulatory outcomes. Ireland’s expertise as a global financial services hub positions it to lead efforts in building a more resilient, integrated, and innovative financial system for the EU By focusing on these three themes, Ireland can help drive a Presidency programme that is ambitious, balanced, and responsive to the evolving needs of the EU and its citizens, while directly addressing the competitiveness challenge at the heart of Europe’s future."
171,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ece86f17/Banking__Payments_Federation_Ireland_-_Submission_171.docx,Banking & Payments Federation Ireland,,,,2,"Key Policy Areas and Legislative Proposals for the Irish Presidency of the Council in 2026 Building on the overarching themes of competitiveness, simplification, and integration of the EU financial architecture, the Irish Presidency should prioritise the following financial services policy areas and legislative proposals: Advancing the Savings and Investment Union (SIU). Ireland should champion the development of deeper and more liquid capital markets to close the EU’s €800bn annual investment gap and restore global competitiveness. Focus areas should relate to: Removing barriers to cross-border investment: Launch a review of national barriers and push for the replacement of Directives with Regulations where appropriate, especially in listing, trading, and posttrade frameworks as outlined in the EU MIP. Harmonise insolvency law: Progress a common EU-wide legal framework to enable true capital markets via the EU 28th regime. Revitalise securitisation markets: Prioritise finding agreement with the European Parliament on a revised securitisation framework. From an industry perspective, the ambition of policymakers on securitisation is being viewed as a litmus test for the wider SIU agenda. As such, we believe it is crucial that the final agreement is ambitious, more risk-sensitive and proportionate from a capital/risk weight floor perspective, and that there is alignment in terms haircuts with covered bonds. Boost retail investor participation: without simplifying the investor journey and creating the correct tax incentives, retail investors will remain uninvested in EU markets. We therefore firmly believe the Irish Government needs to prioritise SIAs both domestically and at EU level. At the same time, policymakers must simplify disclosure requirements and harmonise investor protection rules via the RIS. Promote financial literacy: Accelerate the EU’s Financial Literacy Strategy and coordinate progress on Savings and Investment Accounts. Simplification and Proportionality in Regulation. The Irish Presidency should drive a smarter, simpler, and more agile regulatory environment, focussing on: Revising the macroprudential framework for banks: This should focus on eliminating unnecessary or duplicative capital buffers while addressing double counting of risks. Review O-SII methodology calculation: Ensure O-SII designations reflect actual systemic importance and do not disproportionately impact smaller member states as currently the case. Focus on O-SII designation should form a key part of any discussions on revising the macroprudential framework. Establish a dedicated investment firm regime: EU capital market development hinges on having deep and liquid markets both primary and secondary. Having active market makers is therefore essential. Given many of the largest EU market makers are located in Ireland, we believe the Irish Government should focus on reviewing the Investment Firms Regime to ensure it is proportionate and risk-based – removing inappropriate bank-focused rules like arbitrary balance sheet thresholds and the application of BRRD. Embed competitiveness mandates within the ESAs: Integrate competitiveness and sustainable growth into the mandates of EU supervisory authorities. Simplify CRR/CRD reporting: Streamline requirements and ensure future revisions do not add complexity, especially for smaller institutions. Strengthening and Harmonising Financial Architecture. Ireland should lead efforts to create a more resilient, integrated, and innovative financial system. Enhance supervisory convergence: Through the EU MIP package, Ireland should look to tackle internal barriers and ensure consistent regulatory outcomes across Member States. The overarching principle should be that supervisory outcomes across the EU are consistent, rather than necessarily on centralised supervision. Improve trading and post-trade market structure: Foster competition among infrastructure providers and standardise post-trade processes. Additionally, the Irish Government should focus on structural issues that give way to unlevel playing field issues, like the use of single market maker models operating in some EU jurisdictions. Sustainable Finance and Digital Innovation. Harmonise sustainability rules: Better alignment of frameworks such as CRR/CRD, MiFID, SFDR, CSRD, and the EU Taxonomy to reduce duplication and regulatory fragmentation is needed above and beyond the EU Omnibus package. Advance digital finance: There is a real need to simplify the digital/cyber regulatory framework, remove overlaps between DORA and the Cyber Resilience Act, and support a market-driven approach to the digital euro and open finance. Consumer Protection and Housing Develop a harmonised EU consumer protection framework: Advocate for a harmonised, outcomesfocused, and principle-based consumer protection framework. This will strengthen trust in the financial system, support cross-border financial services, and underpin the Savings and Investment Union. Support effective delivery of housing: Progress the EU Affordable Housing Plan and advocate for more flexible State aid rules to enable Member States to support viable housing projects. Driving Reform of Third Party Litigation Funding (TPLF): Ireland should champion EU-wide reform of third party litigation funding and collective redress frameworks. Experience in the UK has shown that the current opt-out regime can result in low consumer redress rates, high litigation costs, and disproportionate benefits for funders and lawyers rather than claimants. Without reform, there is a risk of speculative claims, economic inefficiency, and adverse impacts on innovation and market capitalisation. The Irish Presidency should lead efforts to introduce enhanced scrutiny at the certification stage, establish a formal regulatory framework for litigation funders, and ensure independent oversight of the distribution phase. These reforms would help deliver fairer, more effective redress for consumers, reduce uncertainty for businesses, and safeguard the integrity of the EU’s collective actions regime."

Assuming leadership amid geopolitical turbulence and significant legislative activity in financial services, Ireland is well placed to champion an agenda that strengthens Europe’s resilience, competitiveness and capacity to drive positive change throughout the Single Market. Above all, having a laser focus on simplifying the regulatory framework and rebuilding economic competitiveness is of paramount importance. That is why we strongly believe that the Irish Presidency should prioritise resources on the EU’s biggest and most pressing issues, like the SIU, the Markets Integration Package, the EU budget and simplification. All of these “big ticket” items can have a real impact on EU citizens either through enhancing economic activity, how companies raise money, consumers invest for retirement or through large scale infrastructure projects that provide a public good. To deliver the greatest impact, the Council must address the root causes of Europe’s competitiveness challenge. The most substantial progress can be made by advancing the EU’s Savings and Investment Union (SIU). The SIU is not just a financial sector initiative – it is a strategic lever for unlocking the EU’s economic potential. By developing deeper and more liquid capital markets, the EU can mobilise household savings for productive investment, close the innovation gap, and diversify funding sources for key priorities such as decarbonisation and digitalisation. However, this will require tough political decisions and a willingness to break down entrenched barriers, including harmonising insolvency law, revitalising the securitisation market, and removing obstacles to cross-border investment. The Irish Presidency can play a pivotal role as a bridge builder, fostering compromise and driving forward the SIU agenda to ensure that capital flows efficiently across the Union. Equally, a simplified and proportionate regulatory environment is fundamental to enabling the financial sector to act as a true catalyst for growth and resilience. The current regulatory landscape is characterised by complexity and fragmentation, which imposes unnecessary administrative burdens and stifles innovation – especially for smaller institutions. By championing “simplification rather than deregulation”, the Irish Presidency can help ensure that regulations are fit for purpose, proportionate to risk, and do not create undue barriers compared to global peers. The need for simplification is particularly acute in the digital and cyber domain. The EU’s ambitious digital agenda has resulted in a patchwork of overlapping rules, making compliance challenging and potentially undermining Europe’s global competitiveness. The Irish Presidency should take a pragmatic approach to ongoing negotiations, prioritising the digital omnibus package and ensuring that frameworks like DORA and the Cyber Resilience Act are aligned and proportionate. By advancing a future-proof regulatory framework for digital finance, the Council can foster responsible innovation, support cross-border data sharing, and strengthen both business growth and consumer protection. In summary, by concentrating resources on the SIU and regulatory simplification, Ireland’s Presidency can help shape a pragmatic, competitive, and innovation-driven EU financial framework – one that delivers real benefits for citizens and businesses, and positions the EU as a global leader in economic resilience and growth."
171,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ece86f17/Banking__Payments_Federation_Ireland_-_Submission_171.docx,Banking & Payments Federation Ireland,,,,4,"Effectively communicating the values and benefits of EU membership to citizens and fostering a genuine sense of ownership over Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU, demands a strategic, multi-layered approach that resonates at both local and national levels. To make the benefits of EU membership truly relatable, communication should centre on tangible outcomes. This means highlighting how EU membership has spurred economic growth, created jobs, harmonised consumer protections, and enabled infrastructural improvements throughout Ireland. Organising events and awareness campaigns further strengthens this strategy. Collaborative projects with schools, local authorities, and various stakeholders can ensure these initiatives are inclusive and relevant, reaching people from all walks of life. These efforts help bridge the gap between citizens and policymakers, encouraging active participation, and a sense of shared purpose. Ireland’s presidency should not concentrate events solely in Dublin but extend them across the country to reflect the national character and economic diversity. The Ireland for Finance strategy has shown that regional promotion delivers tangible benefits: today, one in four international financial services jobs are outside Dublin. By hosting presidency events beyond Dublin, Ireland would not only showcase its vibrant regional economies but also reinforce the message that prosperity and innovation are shared across the island. This approach aligns directly with the government’s own findings that regionalisation strengthens both industry and local labour markets, ensuring that Ireland’s international reputation is built on inclusivity and balance. To further strengthen this approach, the Irish Presidency should focus on delivering and communicating progress on “big ticket” policy items that have a visible and positive impact on people’s lives and the wider economy. When citizens see real movement on issues such as economic competitiveness, simplification of rules, and the removal of barriers to business and opportunity, it becomes clear that the EU is focused on outcomes that matter. This not only demonstrates that the EU delivers but also helps counter the perception that the Union is overly complex or burdensome. A key part of this communication strategy should be to simplify the language used in all Presidency messaging. EU policy is often seen as technical and inaccessible; therefore, the Irish Presidency should set a new standard by focusing on the “purpose” and “impact” of each proposal. Every communication should answer: “Why does this matter?” and “How will it improve people’s lives?” By translating complex policy into clear, relatable language, the Presidency can make the EU’s work more accessible and meaningful. It is also important to reframe the narrative around the Single Market. While it is one of the EU’s greatest achievements, its benefits often go unnoticed. The Presidency should highlight concrete examples of how the Single Market enables Irish businesses to grow, supports jobs, and gives consumers more choice and better prices. By making these benefits visible, citizens can better appreciate the value of EU membership. Finally, by prioritising simplification and the removal of unnecessary barriers, the Irish Presidency can show that policymakers are serious about improving economic performance and reducing complexity. This not only benefits businesses but also reassures citizens that the EU is evolving to meet their needs."

It drives trade, supports jobs, and connects people and cultures in ways no other industry can. Aviation plays a critical role in both the EU and Irish economies and crucially is a key social and economic connector to regions across the globe. Europe maintains a key competitive advantage in aircraft leasing, anchored by Ireland, as the world’s leading aircraft leasing hub employing 8,500 people directly and indirectly with total assets of €268bn. Policies to enhance and strengthen aviation should be prioritised by the Irish Presidency and could fall under the theme Ireland 2025: Sustaining human connection, promoting economic growth. Draft an EU Aviation Strategy As a sector undergoing profound transformation, a dedicated EU Aviation Strategy is warranted. The EU’s aviation sector exports €55bn annually, demonstrating its global competitive advantage that must be retained and expanded. An EU Aviation Strategy aligns with the pressing need at home to develop a longterm horizon for aviation in Ireland through a revised National Aviation Policy (NAP). Decarbonisation of aviation The decarbonisation of European transport is a massive undertaking which requires policy certainty, technological neutrality and private sector buy-in. The lack of supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across Europe, as well as a lack of incentives for the production of SAF, is frustrating decarbonisation efforts as EU mandates only grow in scope. The recently published Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), a strategic framework to boost investment in renewable and low-carbon aviation and maritime fuels must be prioritised and further developed / enhanced, as it can provide the policy certainty needed to kickstart the market and deliver on Europe's decarbonisation ambitions for aviation. Regulatory resources for aviation The aerospace supply chain is experiencing significant challenges, including the capacity of EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to carry out its core duties in a timely fashion, such as certification duties. The global aviation industry is set to double over the next two decades presenting a strong opportunity for Europe to capitalize on its competitive advantage in this high-technology, export-oriented industry, EASA must be adequately funded and resourced to enable European business to continue to be competitive globally. Trade & U.S. investment policy The European economy requires stability and predictability with the U.S., our largest trading partner. The inclusion of zero tariffs for aircraft and aircraft parts should be retained indefinitely to help support the continued success of European aerospace, aircraft leasing and aviation sectors. Taxation policy Safeguard Ireland’s ability to attract and retain aircraft leasing companies by ensuring a competitive, consistent, and transparent EU tax regime. In the absence of this, we fear that rising administration and compliance costs could threaten Ireland’s aircraft leasing sector’s long-term competitiveness. In addition, maintain the current VAT regime for aviation, i.e. zero-rating with the right to deduct input VAT, which reflects international practice (International Civil Aviation Organisation Doc. 8632) in exempting international air transport from VAT. • Sanctions policy Continued dialogue with industry should be a cornerstone for sanctions evolution. On the assumption that sanctions against Russia are maintained throughout Ireland’s Presidency careful consideration needs to be given in relation to the potential inclusion of additional products, such as critical raw materials (such as titanium) which may result in unintended consequences for the European aerospace industry by creating dependencies on supply from outside the EU, which is not aligned with the EU’s drive for strategic autonomy."

The recently published STIP will provide financing and investment frameworks while aiming to de-risk private investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the maritime and aviation industry. Ireland has a rich aviation heritage and strong reputation in this competitive market. As the first EU country to launch a SAF Policy Roadmap, Ireland should prioritise implementation of STIP measures to ensure rapid scale-up of SAF production and associated alternative fuel infrastructure (AFI), explore EU-level incentives (e.g. dedicated funding, offtake guarantees) to boost viability while developing an indigenous SAF sector. In addition, while the Commission is assessing its feasibility, we must expedite a Book-and-Claim to enable global access to SAF and avoid costly, piecemeal infrastructure projects. Innovative technologies for zeroemission aviation must be considered including battery propulsion air mobility and the hydrogen supply chain. Increase EASA Funding Despite setting safety standards for 41 states, EASA operates on a budget (~€250–300 million) and staff (~800) dramatically lower than the U.S. FAA (40,000 staff, ~$20 billion budget). EASA must scale up to ensure Europe maintains its competitive advantage and to ensure the efficient certification of existing and emerging technologies as well as SAF, drones, etc to maintain pace with technological innovations, meet the EU’s commitment to decreasing transport greenhouse gas emissions and develop and produce SAF in Europe. Increased funding would empower EASA to: ➢ Align budgets and workforce with its global counterparts, Expand digital, environmental, and cybersecurity capabilities, Maintain Europe’s top-tier safety record, Create additional high value and essential jobs in Europe across the aviation ecosystem, including pilots, engineers, etc. Support emerging technologies and sustainable aviation, ➢ Ensure fair, proportional oversight, and ➢ Strengthen stakeholder collaboration. • Draft an EU Aviation Strategy Given that the current Aviation Strategy for Europe dates back to 2015, a comprehensive update is now necessary. We urge the prioritisation of a renewed strategic framework that simultaneously safeguards the sector’s global competitive edge and accelerates the delivery of the EU’s ambitious decarbonisation mandates. An EU aviation strategy is vital to: Support the economic and societal benefits and connectivity of aviation, Support the 15 million jobs and $1.2 trillion in European economic activity, Uphold safety, security, and regulatory clarity and fairness, ➢ Support innovation, technological innovations and net-zero goals.

The Presidency should aim to advance negotiations and secure meaningful progress on legislative files underpinning the SIU, laying the foundation for long-term EU competitiveness and financial resilience. Positioning Ireland as the SIU “Implementation Model” Ireland’s financial services sector is well-placed to serve as a practical reference point for Member States in the development of the SIU. Domestic reforms—such as simplification efforts, product innovation, and proportionate regulation, will serve as practical leadership. The Presidency should facilitate knowledgesharing to drive consensus on fit-for-purpose, consumer-friendly investment products. Promoting Cross-Border Simplification and Eliminating Duplication A priority for the Presidency should be advancing EU-level initiatives that streamline cross-border distribution and reduce unnecessary regulatory duplication, supporting the Capital Markets Union and efficient European capital markets. This is not a call for deregulation, but rather for coherent and aligned regulation that supports competitiveness. The Commission has committed to addressing overlaps across legislative files—for example, between DORA and the Cyber Resilience Act, and within ESG-related reporting frameworks. It will be important for the Irish Presidency to monitor progress closely and ensure that the Commission delivers on its commitment to eliminate these inefficiencies. Strengthening European Financial Culture and Consumer Protection Ireland should champion the implementation of the Commission’s Financial Literacy Strategy across all Member States. A more financially informed population is critical to consumer protection, retail investor participation and financing Europe’s green and digital transitions, as well as increased participation in European capital markets. Embedding a shared European financial culture will support the long-term objectives of the SIU, ensuring savers are both protected and empowered to engage confidently with financial products.

Ireland can promote systematic conflict analysis across all external action files, encourage the use of flexible funding that supports diplomacy, mediation and peacebuilding at every stage, and champion stronger links between EU delegations, civil society and local peacebuilders who provide essential context and continuity. A Presidency that prioritises the entire conflict cycle would help shift the EU from reactive responses to coherent, long-term peacebuilding. Ireland should also integrate a concise but firm set of priorities that address current global challenges to peace. The EU must reinforce humanitarian disarmament by strengthening the Ottawa Convention and advancing humanitarian mine action. Recent attempts by some states to dilute commitments or withdraw from the Convention highlight the need for renewed diplomatic engagement, better compliance support and expanded assistance for communities living with the daily threat of explosive ordnance. Ireland is well placed to mobilise member states behind a unified EU position that protects the integrity of this vital treaty. At the same time, Ireland should reaffirm the Women, Peace and Security agenda as a core pillar of EU external action. A growing gender backlash is undermining women’s participation in peace processes and limiting funding for women peacebuilders. Ireland can counter this trend by promoting stronger accountability for WPS commitments in all Council working groups, protecting hard won gains and signalling that gender equality remains essential for durable peace. Together, these priorities would allow Ireland to help the European Union act as a more effective and principled force for peace at a moment when international norms and multilateral cooperation face significant pressure."

Ireland’s track record in humanitarian diplomacy, conflict prevention and multilateralism positions it well to steer the Council toward constructive and coherent outcomes. A central focus should be the EU’s external action framework, particularly policies that bridge humanitarian, development and peace efforts. Following the publication of the Communication on Humanitarian Aid in Q2 of 2026, the Irish Presidency should lead the adoption of Council conclusions that reinforce conflict prevention and peace within the EU’s approach to fragility. These conclusions should underline the need for conflict sensitive planning across all EU financial instruments, stronger coordination between humanitarian, development and peace actors and sustained political attention to promoting dialogue and reducing violence in fragile contexts. By reinforcing the peace element of the HDP nexus, the EU will be better equipped to address complex crises where humanitarian need is rooted in protracted conflict. Ireland should also prioritise updated Council conclusions on conflict prevention and peacebuilding. The last comprehensive conclusions in this field are dated, given the outbreak of war on the European continent and active conflict reaching the highest levels worldwide since WWII. Updated conclusions should reaffirm prevention as a strategic EU priority, call for systematic conflict analysis across all external policies, support inclusive mediation efforts and strengthen partnerships with civil society and local peacebuilders. The Presidency should aim for clear operational commitments that can guide Council working groups and EU delegations in fragile and conflict affected environments. The Irish Presidency should address the planned reduction in the EU’s diplomatic footprint, involving centralising staff in regional hubs and downsizing delegation presence on the ground. This trend undermines diplomacy as a primary tool for conflict prevention and resolution, as local engagement and contextual understanding are essential for early action. Ireland should encourage a renewed commitment to field-based diplomacy, backed by adequate staffing, political access and resources. In its upcoming Presidency of the Council, Ireland should promote greater transparency and oversight of the EU’s expanding defence capability and production initiatives, including initiatives under ReArm Europe. Increased defence investments and new instruments supporting arms production require clear safeguards to ensure coherence with the EU’s commitments to conflict prevention, humanitarian principles and responsible export controls. Ireland can encourage systematic impact assessments, improved public reporting and stronger parliamentary scrutiny across relevant initiatives. Such measures would help ensure that defence related policies reinforce, rather than undermine, the EU’s wider goals of sustainable peace, human security and international stability."

Lasting prosperity depends on reducing the risks and costs associated with conflict, both within the EU and in its neighbourhood. By strengthening conflict prevention, supporting inclusive dialogue, reinforcing the EU’s integrated approach to fragility and promoting social peace, the Presidency can help create safer environments for citizens, more predictable conditions for businesses and more resilient communities.

371,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/98740a32/Research_Ireland_-_Submission_371.docx,Research Ireland,State Agency,"Research & Innovation, funding",National/EU wide.,1,"Ireland should express three mutually reinforcing high‑level priorities for its 2026 Council Presidency. 1) Talent and Open Knowledge. The Presidency should champion policies that attract, develop, and retain world‑class researchers across all disciplines while embedding open research as the default. In practice, this means promoting predictable, excellence‑based programmes from PhD to principal investigator, revitalising research infrastructure so that Europe remains globally competitive, and advancing FAIR data and open access to maximise the impact and reusability of publicly funded knowledge. These actions mirror our domestic commitments to annual investigator‑led calls, an expanded PhD pipeline, well-equipped facilities, and a system‑wide shift to open research and research assessment reform. 2) Innovation and Competitiveness. The Presidency should emphasise translation of excellent science into productivity, quality jobs, and strategic autonomy. We propose prioritising large‑scale public–private partnerships and mission‑oriented instruments that de‑risk private R&D, support SMEs to collaborate across borders, and accelerate the creation and scaling of spin‑outs. This includes facilitating simpler co‑funding models, clearer IP and data‑sharing norms, and better brokerage so that high‑potential firms and regions can connect to European value chains. 3) Societal Impact and Cohesion. The Presidency should place interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research at the centre of European problem‑solving in areas citizens care about most: climate resilience and energy transition, trustworthy and inclusive digital transformation (including AI), health and ageing, and housing and the built environment. Engaged research where communities and end‑users co‑design and co‑implement research should be promoted so that policy and public services are informed by evidence and earn public trust. These priorities reflect Ireland’s strengths as a small, open, and agile economy that brokers collaboration and builds consensus. They align naturally with an international government strategy that deepens links in the ERA while diversifying global partnerships so that European researchers, companies, and regions can access broader talent pools, infrastructures, and markets. Taken together, the three priorities provide a clear and people‑centred vision for a Presidency that accelerates researcher mobility and openness, strengthens Europe’s innovation capacity, and delivers tangible societal benefit."
371,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/98740a32/Research_Ireland_-_Submission_371.docx,Research Ireland,State Agency,"Research & Innovation, funding",National/EU wide.,2,"Research Ireland recommends several policy areas and associated goals for the Irish Presidency in 2026. 1) Open Research and Research Assessment Reform. The Presidency should seek Council conclusions that consolidate Europe’s transition to FAIR data and open access, embedding transparent data‑management planning, robust repositories, and interoperable metadata across Member States. Reform of research assessment should recognise a broader range of outputs—such as data sets, software, interdisciplinary collaboration, engagement with policy and society, and talent development—alongside publications and citations. This combination will increase reproducibility and accelerate knowledge diffusion while preserving research and knowledge security. 2) Research Careers, Mobility, and Visas. Building on Europe’s excellence programmes, Ireland should promote a Council roadmap for modern research careers that provides predictable, excellence‑based opportunities at all stages, improves intersectoral mobility, and reduces administrative friction for visas and secondments. This includes better alignment with the EU Framework Programme’s Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions, increased portability of grants and pensions where feasible, and interoperable recognition of skills and qualifications. 3) Public–Private Partnerships and European Innovation Capacity. To convert knowledge into competitiveness, the Presidency should advance simplified frameworks for large‑scale partnerships, Research Centre‑style collaborations, and Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs). Clearer co‑funding models, proportionate reporting, and streamlined state‑aid guidance will help SMEs and FDI‑intensive sectors to engage at scale. Guidance on data‑sharing, IP, and standard‑setting can further speed translation and embed high‑value activity in Europe. 4) Mission‑Driven, Interdisciplinary Research for Societal Challenges. The Presidency should facilitate cross‑domain, cross‑border initiatives that tackle climate resilience, energy, digital trust and AI governance, health innovation, and housing. Programmes should require meaningful engagement with end‑users and public administrations, with explicit pathways to policy adoption and service delivery, so that results are implemented and felt by citizens. 5) Internationalisation within the ERA. The Presidency should reinforce diversified, values‑based international cooperation that strengthens European capacity while safeguarding research security. Practical steps include enhanced National Contact Point networks, structured support for consortia formation, and measures that raise participation and success rates across Member States—particularly for smaller research systems. Indicative Presidency deliverables include: (a) Council conclusions on open research and engaged research; (b) a Council roadmap on researcher mobility and careers; and (c) practical guidance for scaling public–private partnerships, including clear participation pathways for SMEs and smaller Member States in IPCEIs and co‑funded partnerships."

Predictable and excellence‑based programmes across all disciplines, coupled with modern infrastructures, will expand the researcher pipeline that sustains innovation in SMEs and FDI companies, strengthens the competitiveness of higher education, and equips the public sector with the analytical capacity for evidence‑informed policy. Convert research into innovation capacity at company and ecosystem level. Scaling public–private centres, co‑funded partnerships, and spin‑out pathways will de‑risk private R&D, improve productivity, and create high‑quality jobs in every region. Simplified rules for cross‑border collaboration and brokerage will allow SMEs to participate more easily in European value chains. Deliver mission‑driven outcomes that citizens can feel. Interdisciplinary programmes should address climate resilience and energy affordability, trustworthy AI and digital inclusion, health and ageing, and housing and the built environment. Using engaged research methods that are co‑designed with communities and public services translate scientific advances into better local services, healthier environments, and stronger social cohesion. Strengthen international connectivity to lift performance system‑wide. Facilitating mobility, secondments, and diversified partnerships will help retain and attract talent, give researchers access to world‑class facilities, and improve success in European programmes. Embed an evidence‑informed public sector. The Presidency can promote EU guidance and communities of practice on research‑policy interfaces, meta‑research and benchmarking, and the use of data analytics to target investments where they make the greatest difference. These levers enable Ireland to be a strategic leader, partner, connector, and advocate to ensure that excellent research reliably becomes widely shared prosperity and quality of life."

We propose, first, telling human stories of impact. Communications should consistently link EU‑funded and nationally funded research to tangible outcomes such as new medicines, cleaner and cheaper energy, safer and more trustworthy digital services, and cultural wellbeing. Case studies should follow a ‘from lab to life’ arc that explains the journey from discovery to everyday benefit. Co‑create with citizens through engaged research. Presidency‑branded living labs, open town halls with researchers and policymakers, and community‑based participatory research can invite citizens to shape priorities and monitor progress. These formats not only improve relevance and uptake but also build trust by making research transparent and collaborative. Be open by default. FAIR/open practices should extend to communication: open data showcases, code and data reproducibility demonstrations, and simple, transparent impact dashboards that visualise collaboration networks, funding flows, and local benefits during the Presidency term. Local to European. A distributed campaign delivered with universities, Technological Universities, Research Centres and regional hubs should connect local priorities to EU missions. Diaspora‑enabled research networks and diplomatic missions can amplify these stories internationally, positioning Ireland as a welcoming, outward‑looking science nation. One Team Ireland narrative. Messages should be aligned across Research Ireland, DFHERIS, the HEA, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and diplomatic missions so the Presidency is seen as a national endeavour that advances European progress."

A safe, open and accountable digital public sphere - Use the Presidency to prioritise full implementation and enforcement of the Digital Services Act and the proposed “democracy shield” to effectively tackle online harassment, disinformation and foreign interference, with special attention being paid to the safety of candidates, elected representatives, journalists and activists—especially women and minorities, and to promote and ensure electoral integrity and transparency. Protection of civic space and human rights defenders - Champion EU-wide standards to protect NGOs, community groups, libraries, schools and media outlets from intimidation, SLAPPs and reputational attacks, and to ensure they can promote equality, inclusion and democratic participation without fear. Equality, anti-racism and social cohesion as democracy goals - Frame gender equality, anti-racism and anti-discrimination as core democratic infrastructure, including action on hate crime/hate speech, support for inclusive local democracy, and targeted initiatives to increase the participation of women from minority and migrant backgrounds.

Digital democracy and platform accountability The Irish Presidency could focus on enforcement of the Digital Services Act, the new European Democracy Shield and the Centre for Democratic Resilience. The aim would be to drive strict, electionfocused enforcement of the DSA (with a particular focus on disinformation, deepfakes and targeted political ads), embed robust gender and anti-racism safeguards in the Democracy Shield, and secure Council conclusions on protecting candidates—particularly women and minorities—from online abuse and manipulation. Combating online and offline violence against women (including women in politics) The Irish Presidency could focus on the Directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence (EU 2024/1385) making sure that the Directive is implemented ambitiously in all member states, with specific standards and guidance on tackling abuse directed at women in public life, including candidates, councillors, members of parliament, journalists, and activists. Media freedom, pluralism and safety of journalists and public figures The Irish Presidency could focus on the implementation of the European Media Freedom Act (Regulation 2024/1083), including rules on media independence, ownership transparency and protection from political interference with an emphasis on securing strong, independence-protecting interpretations of EMFA, and underlining the safeguarding of local and public-interest media and the prevention of smear campaigns and coordinated harassment targeting women and minority voices. Protecting civic space and those who participate in public debate (anti-SLAPP) The Irish Presidency could focus on the transposition and strengthening of the Anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation) Directive on protecting people engaged in public participation (EU 2024/1069) to ensure the Directive becomes a real shield - early dismissal of abusive cases, cost protection, and effective compensation - explicitly highlighting protection for NGOs, community leaders and politically active women who may be sued to intimidate them out of public life. Gender-balanced representation and safe conditions for political participation The Irish Presidency could focus on follow-up to the EU Gender Equality Strategy; implementation of equality and anti-discrimination law; and continued use of funding programmes like CERV and Erasmus+ to support women’s political leadership. The aim would be to secure Council conclusions committing to concrete targets for women’s representation at all levels (local, national, EU), minimum standards on candidate safety and anti-harassment measures within parties and institutions, and ring-fenced EU funding for women’s leadership, training and candidate-support schemes."

Ireland can lead with a unifying theme: brain health across the life course—prevention, early diagnosis, timely treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term support. This reflects the lived reality that neurological conditions affect 1 in 3 people and are often lifelong, fluctuating, and “invisible.” EFNA’s survey ( n=4,800 responses of people living with neurological conditions in the EU) shows the scale of unmet need: fatigue (85%), pain (74%), sleep issues (74%), and stigma (84%). A presidency priority should explicitly connect clinical outcomes with quality of life, participation, and dignity—because neurological conditions are not only “health” issues; they affect work, education, relationships, and income. 2) “Digital, data, and trust—people-powered innovation.” Make Europe’s digital health agenda tangible by prioritising trusted health data use for better care and research, while protecting rights. EFNA data underscores why: 85% report clinicians did not believe symptom severity; 67% were initially misdiagnosed; 56% struggled to describe symptoms. Better data pathways, patient-reported outcomes, and interoperability can reduce diagnostic delay and disbelief—if implemented with transparency, safeguards, and meaningful patient involvement. 3) “Fairness & inclusion: participation in society despite chronic illness and disability.” A thematic priority should tackle the social impact of neurological conditions: EFNA reports 71% adjusted their job role or schedule, yet only 35% found employers accommodating; 74% face higher living costs; 72% report negative income impact; and 37% of those applying for mortgages/insurance were denied due to their condition. A presidency priority on inclusion aligns with EU values and improves economic participation. 4) “Competitiveness with purpose: life sciences, access, and affordability.” Ireland can credibly convene a “competitiveness that delivers” agenda: encourage biomedical innovation (including biotech) while ensuring equitable access to medicines and technologies across Member States—especially for neurology where unmet need remains substantial. 5) “Future preparedness: workforce, prevention, and long-term care.” Neurology depends on specialist teams and continuity of care. A forward-looking priority should include health workforce planning, community-based services, and prevention/risk reduction across the lifespan. Key EFNA message for the programme: Europe cannot claim resilience or competitiveness if millions remain unheard, misdiagnosed, and excluded from work and community life associated with significant losses to national and EU funds ( ~798 billion annually- data from the European Brain Council https://www.braincouncil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Open-Access-Government-October-2019.pdf)."

Aim to embed meaningful patient access, easy-to-use consent/permissions where relevant, and systematic use of patient-reported outcomes to capture “invisible” symptoms (fatigue, pain, sleep, cognition). EFNA’s findings on disbelief, misdiagnosis, and difficulty describing symptoms show why EHDS must improve the clinical encounter, not just infrastructure. 2) EU Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Joint Clinical Assessments (JCA): make patient relevance non-negotiable. Since JCAs began in January 2025 for oncology medicines and ATMPs, apply to orphan medicine from 2028 and all medicines from 2030, Ireland should prioritise smooth implementation and quality—ensuring endpoints reflect outcomes that matter to neurology patients (function, fatigue, cognition, ability to work, caregiver burden). Aim: strengthen guidance and practice for patient input so that decisions reflect real-world benefit and reduce inequities in access. 3) EU pharmaceutical reform (“pharma package”): access, supply, and innovation balance. Ireland should steer remaining steps so reform improves availability and affordability while sustaining R&D. Aim: champion provisions that reduce shortages and speed access, and ensure incentives align with unmet need (including neurological and rare neurological conditions). 4) EU Biotech Act: accelerate responsibly, with patient benefit and security. Ireland should support an innovation-friendly framework that also addresses ethical, safety, and dual-use/biosecurity concerns. Aim: improve translation for advanced therapies relevant to neurology while maintaining robust oversight and public trust. 5) European Reference Networks (ERNs) and cross-border care: strengthen the “expertise without borders” model. Ireland should promote deeper integration of ERNs into national pathways (referral, reimbursement, digital consults), especially for rare and complex neurological conditions. Aim: make ERNs easier to access, reduce geographic inequity, and support shared clinical guidelines and registries. 6) Brain health research partnership & a European Neurological Health Strategy: from advocacy to action. With the European Partnership for Brain Health planned to start in January 2026, Ireland’s presidency is perfectly timed to align Council discussions on research, implementation science, and health system uptake. Aim: secure cross-DG and cross-Council momentum for an EU-level brain/neurological health strategy that links prevention, care pathways, workforce, and research."

The Council can focus on decisions that change what people experience: earlier diagnosis, fewer crises, better functioning, and real inclusion in work and community. 1) Reduce misdiagnosis and disbelief—systematically. EFNA survey data is stark: 85% say clinicians did not believe symptom severity; 83% did not receive adequate treatment because they were not taken seriously; 67% were initially misdiagnosed; 56% struggled to describe symptoms. Council work can push Member States to embed health literacy and communication training, standardised symptom assessment, and patient-reported outcomes into care pathways—supported by EHDS implementation. 2) Turn EHDS into better care and faster research (with trust). Prioritise practical cross-border use cases: medication lists, diagnostic summaries, imaging, and emergency data—plus federated research access that accelerates neurology studies while protecting privacy. The impact for business is clear too: predictable rules and interoperability reduce duplication and lower innovation costs for SMEs and medtech. 3) Improve access and affordability through HTA coordination. Robust JCAs can reduce duplication, speed national decisions, and support more equitable access—especially when assessments consider outcomes that matter in neurological conditions (fatigue, cognition, function, participation). Faster access reduces long-term disability costs and supports productivity. 4) Strengthen ERNs and rare neurology pathways. For rare/complex neurological diseases, expertise is scarce. Better ERN integration reduces “postcode lotteries,” supports earlier correct diagnosis, and enables shared standards. Communities benefit when people can stay active locally while accessing specialist expertise digitally. 5) Keep people in work and education. EFNA shows 71% adjusted work; only 35% had employer accommodation; 72% saw negative income impact; 74% faced higher living costs. Council conclusions and coordinated initiatives can promote disability inclusion, flexible work supports, anti-discrimination practice in insurance/finance, and caregiver recognition—lifting participation and reducing poverty risk. 6) Invest in prevention and long-term care capacity. Council momentum can align EU4Health, Horizon Europe, and national reforms toward prevention, rehabilitation, and community services. This is where citizens see “EU added value”: less fragmentation, more continuity, and healthier ageing."

Use a simple narrative: EU cooperation improves care, access, and fairness. Pair personal stories (patients, carers, clinicians) with EFNA survey facts (n,4800 pan EU): stigma 84%, fatigue 85%, misdiagnosis 67%, work disruption 71%, higher living costs 74%. The combination is powerful: emotional truth + credible evidence. 2) Make the Presidency participatory, not performative. Create visible channels for citizen input: regional dialogues (including rural communities), disability-accessible formats, youth and older-person panels, and targeted sessions with patient organisations and caregivers. Publish “you said / we did” summaries monthly to show impact and accountability. 3) Communicate through trusted messengers. Citizens trust local clinicians, community organisations, and patient groups more than institutions. Partner with civil society (including EFNA members), universities, libraries, employers, and local media to explain what dossiers (EHDS, HTA, pharma reform) mean in practice: fewer forms, safer cross-border care, quicker access to medicines, better research. 4) Show transparency on trade-offs. Explain openly how Europe balances privacy with research, affordability with innovation, and national competence with EU coordination. Trust grows when uncertainty and limits are acknowledged. 5) Create simple “Presidency dashboards” focused on outcomes. Instead of listing meetings, track citizen-relevant indicators: steps completed on EHDS implementation guidance, JCA stakeholder involvement quality, ERN accessibility actions, and concrete commitments on brain health research partnership alignment. 6) Celebrate EU membership as shared problem-solving. Frame Ireland’s Presidency as a service to Europeans: convening, brokering, and improving daily life—especially for those whose needs are often invisible. When citizens see their experience reflected (fatigue, pain, stigma, work barriers), they are more likely to feel ownership and pride."

Among current legislative initiatives, the EU should develop the 28th regime for European companies, particularly for SMEs. It will help remove internal barriers in the single market, advance the digitalisation of corporate operations and reduce the fragmented nature of corporate regulation – enhancing the productivity of European businesses. Ireland’s Council Presidency should also focus on deepening, consolidating and modernising the Single Market in the areas of telecoms, energy, defence industry and services. Furthermore, the EU should eventually achieve financial integration by creating a Savings and Investment Union (SIU). Ireland, as a key financial hub, could have a significant role in moving forward among others the ‘Market integration package’ for a single market for financial services. Ireland’s Council Presidency should also promote the simplification of the regulatory agenda, but without resulting in de-regulation. It shall develop funding mechanisms to support European public goods. It will be noted that the next EU budget, the 2028-2035 Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF), is due to be concluded during the Irish Council Presidency, so special attention will need to be devoted to fiscal and budgetary issues, including the introduction of new own resources and future EU debt issuance. Defence and Security Given changes in transatlantic relations, Ireland’s Council Presidency should devote attention to the development of a European defence and technological industrial base. Moreover, given uncertainties about the future role of NATO, and respecting the neutrality of non-aligned EU member states, efforts should be sustained to develop autonomous military capabilities, as well as improve its existing defence governance structures, by strengthening the EU military committee and military planning and conduct capability (MPCC). Ireland’s Council Presidency will need to maintain a strong focus on security and defence in light of Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. This includes strengthening the Union’s capacity to provide long-term security guarantees to Ukraine and addressing the implications of Article 42(7) TEU, the mutual defence clause, particularly in the context of closer political and security alignment with partner countries. Trade and Economic Security Ireland’s Council Presidency should promote the conclusion of new trade agreements and the ratification of deals that the EU has already reached, e.g. with Mercosur. Moreover, it should champion free trade drawing on New Zealand’s example (see FIT Partnership, ACCTS, cooperation with CPTPP) in the interest of EU’s competitiveness. At the same time, Ireland’s Council Presidency should combine openness towards trade with a focus on economic security, e.g. by fully implementing the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Screening Regulation, the Anti-Coercion Instrument and the other mechanisms in the EU toolbox. Enlargement Ireland’s Council Presidency should prioritise EU enlargement as a strategic policy area, based on a merit-based and differentiated approach. Particular focus could be placed on Montenegro and Albania, while negotiations with Ukraine, Moldova and other Western Balkan candidates continue, alongside work on gradual integration, EU absorption capacity including necessary EU reforms and strict rule-of-law conditionality. Fundamental Rights, Justice and the Rule of Law Ireland’s Council Presidency should seek to advance the Art. 7 TEU procedure on rule of law backsliding in Member States, including with a move to a vote on Art. 7 (2) TEU in the Council, as this allows the EU to show that it is capable of acting in light of rule of law threats from within. Deepening of the relationship with the Council of Europe should also be explored. Data protection and digital innovation Ireland’s Council Presidency should preserve its data protection framework and enforcement laws, despite foreign pressures, and start a conversation on the regulation of data centres in the EU, from a cybersecurity, energy, environmental, and technological sovereignty perspective. Securing data centres’ capacity in the EU has a strategic value, and contributes to the objectives of the digital and green transition. Green transition and energy security Ireland’s Council Presidency should continue the fight against climate change while phasing out of Russian fossil fuels. Ireland’s natural endowments place it in a strong position to lead the development of offshore wind energy, thereby enhancing EU energy security and supporting low-carbon economic growth. Ireland should actively promote the expansion of this sector, advancing offshore wind and other low-carbon technologies, building resilient supply chains with non-EU partners. Ireland is well placed to foster these relationships, supported by its longstanding ties with many developing countries. Relationship with the UK Given its role as the closest neighbour to the UK (now a former EU Member State after Brexit) Ireland should use the Council Presidency as an opportunity to deepen EU-UK relations, e.g. by concluding the SPS agreement, and other sectoral accords envisaged in the May 2025 EU-UK reset."

A prominent competitiveness theme will contribute to keeping the EU economy buoyant, creating or preserving employment, lowering costs, raising living standards, and preserving the global position of the EU. For people, businesses and communities’ rights protection: Ireland can have a decisive influence on the lives of Europeans if it seeks to advance the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights. This can be achieved both through policy prioritisation within the Council, as well as through Ireland’s membership of the Council of Europe. For people, businesses and communities’ understanding of the post-COVID-19 Recovery funding: As the Irish Council Presidency will coincide with the end of the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), it would be the ideal moment to showcase to the public the achievements across all EU Member States and in Ireland (projects, reforms and investments), illustrating them concretely throughout the six policy pillars supported with EU funding.

There are many reasons for the level of unemployment such as Frictional, Seasonal, Cyclical and structural. However, the common economic explanation is that up to 5% unemployment is considered as full employment in an economy. We are leaving behind a portion of society by accepting that 5% are not capable of economic activity. However, this number doesn’t include people who are counted under other initiatives such as Community Employment, TUS or other schemes which are short term activities in terms of the participants. Supports for EU Citizens who are unemployed or under-employed are needed. However, with the numbers involved consistently at low percentages of the workforce, I think we need to redefine these terms. Paying a small benefit to people does not take care of many aspects of human need such as self-worth, mental health and personal well-being as well as gaining new skills. EU Employment policy should aim to place people in suitable settings so that these human factors are also supported. For example people placed on Community Employment and TUS Schemes are doing valuable work for a small top up from basic unemployment payments. These jobs need to be done and as participants accept the payment levels it is my opinion that these people are not as such unemployed. Ireland’s Presidency should push our EU partners to rethink how individuals are supported by offering job placement (usually through local companies either Leader Companies or local companies run by volunteers) as distinct from just a payment. Individuals can transition between this type of supported employment to commercial employment if they wish and opportunities arise. This approach can work alongside other employment initiatives."

Within higher education in particular, GCE is a critical and scalable tool for equipping future European citizens, researchers, and professionals with the knowledge, values, and competencies needed to respond to the EU’s most urgent challenges and to advance its long-term strategic goals. GCE aligns directly with two major commitments outlined in the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029: to “become the first climate-neutral continent” and to “take the lead in addressing global challenges”. Higher education institutions are uniquely positioned to contribute to these ambitions by cultivating critical thinking, systems understanding, and informed civic engagement across all disciplines. Embedding GCE into teaching, research, and campus life enables students to engage with the root causes of global challenges and to participate meaningfully in shaping sustainable, just, and democratic futures. Positioning GCE as a Presidency priority also strengthens delivery of the “Free and Democratic Europe” pillar. HEIs are central arenas for democratic debate, media literacy, and civic participation; GCE supports these functions by nurturing the ability to: safeguard the rule of law; strengthen democratic resilience and pluralistic debate; uphold academic freedom and civil society space; promote responsible digital engagement and challenge disinformation; foster a culture of global peace, justice, and solidarity. At a time of rising populism, disinformation, xenophobia, polarisation, and armed conflicts GCE can enhance these contributions by grounding education in shared humanity, critical inquiry, respect for diversity, and a deeper understanding of global interdependencies. Given Ireland’s long-standing leadership in GCE, global solidarity, human rights, and human development, the 2026 Presidency is a key opportunity to reassert these priorities at EU level. Ireland should therefore champion the integration of GCE into the negotiations for the 2028–2034 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). Allowing GCE to slip from the political agenda would be inconsistent with recent EU Council Conclusions and Recommendations, including on: the transformative role of education for sustainable development and global citizenship; education and training for European values and democratic citizenship; learning for the green transition and sustainable development. Prioritising GCE would also align with the Dublin Declaration on Global Education to 2050, endorsed by 25 Member States at the Dublin Congress co-hosted by Ireland and Luxembourg in 2022."

In particular, Ireland should ensure that GCE features within the priorities of the new MFF being currently negotiated. GCE must play a core and expanded role as part of this. In the face of an increasingly challenging climate crisis, rising inequality, war, disinformation, and political extremism it is paramount that EU citizens are informed and engaged to address those challenges. GCE fosters the necessary critical thinking, empathy and understanding of issues. Investment in GCE can contribute to ensuring that future of the European Union is not shaped by fear and division, but by inclusion and equality and justice. The new MFF must therefore ensure robust support for civil society organisations and higher education to deliver inclusive, high-quality GCE initiatives. This includes safeguarding funding for working on human rights, gender equality, peace, and accountability, even in contexts facing local political pressures. transparency, sustainability, and predictability in the financial support of Global Citizenship Education programmes, such as DEAR, Erasmus+, and AgoraEU.

Ireland’s Presidency in 2026 presents a unique opportunity to steer the EU towards a more resilient future—one that safeguards our environment, supports vulnerable communities and ensures long-term prosperity across Member States. By placing environmental resilience at the heart of its Presidency priorities, Ireland can help the Union align its policies with the realities of a rapidly changing climate, degraded ecosystems and increasingly fragile resource systems, including those underpinning our food production. Environmental resilience must begin with preparing the EU for the intensifying impacts of climate change. From rising temperatures and severe droughts to floods and biodiversity collapse, Europe’s ecosystems and economies are already feeling the strain. A Presidency focus on accelerating climate adaptation, advancing nature restoration and ensuring climate-proof investment across sectors would help deliver long-term stability. This includes strengthening the EU’s capacity to prevent and manage climate-related risks, improving water resilience strategies, and ensuring that all relevant sectoral policies—from agriculture to transport—contribute to reducing Europe’s vulnerability to environmental disruption. A central pillar of building environmental resilience is delivering a just transition. The shift towards sustainability will only be successful if it is equitable and socially grounded. Many regions and sectors, particularly rural areas, farmers, fishers and low-income communities, are most exposed to both environmental pressures and structural changes. The Presidency can help advance EU-level frameworks that ensure support, training, and fair economic opportunities accompany the transition to more sustainable practices. This involves creating space for social dialogue, supporting diversification in rural regions and ensuring that environmental ambition goes hand in hand with socioeconomic fairness. A resilient Europe must notably rely on robust, sustainable and secure food systems. Environmental degradation, water scarcity and climate extremes increasingly threaten Europe’s capacity to produce food. At the same time, our current production systems, mostly based on intensive farming practices, often exacerbate these pressures. Strengthening food system resilience therefore requires a long-term shift towards models that work with nature, reduce dependency on vulnerable inputs like imported feed and fertilizers and prioritise efficient resource use in the EU. A Presidency committed to enhancing food system resilience could encourage progress on sustainable farm practices, improved animal welfare standards, reduced waste and a more circular use of resources. These measures benefit ecosystems while supporting farmers in maintaining viable livelihoods in the face of environmental and economic volatility. An overarching Presidency priority focused on Strengthening the EU’s Environmental Resilience through a Just Transition would create coherence across Council formations—linking climate, environment, agriculture, energy and social affairs—while providing the strategic clarity the Union needs."
56,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d12a6bd7/CIWF_International_-_Submission_56.docx,CIWF International,NGO,"Agriculture, Animal Welfare, Environment",EU wide,2,"The Irish Presidency of the Council in 2026 will take place at a strategically significant moment for several major EU agriculture policy files. We highlight three priority areas where Ireland can make a decisive contribution in the field of sustainable food systems and animal welfare. 1. Delivering on the long-overdue revision of the EU animal welfare legislation The European Commission is expected to present the long-awaited revision of the EU’s animal welfare legislation during the Irish Presidency. This will be the first substantial update in more than 20 years, including proposals on phasing out cages as per the European Citizens Initiative “End the Cage Age”. Given the broad support among Irish and European citizens and many Member States for more coherent and science-based standards, Ireland will be uniquely placed to shape the early political framing of this legislative process. The Presidency should ensure the Council begins structured, early discussions on the upcoming proposal, dedicating time to exploring key themes with Member States and engaging proactively with stakeholders to clarify expectations, concerns and opportunities. In parallel, the Presidency will be tasked to facilitate progress, and potentially reach an agreement, on the proposal on animal transport. Ireland should help bridge differing Member State positions, promoting science-based standards that improve conditions for animals during transport, especially vulnerable animals such as unweaned calves. Finally, the Irish Presidency should encourage the Member states to achieve better and more uniform enforcement of the EU’s legislative acquis on animal welfare. This would not only enhance animal welfare but address the market distortions that arise from the differing standards of enforcement in member states. 2. Advancing negotiations on the post-2027 Common Agricultural Policy Negotiations on the next CAP will still be ongoing in 2026 and will be entering a crucial phase. A key task for the Presidency will be to facilitate genuine progress towards a CAP that works for farmed animal welfare, Europeans health and farmers income while ensuring the policy remains aligned with the Union’s climate, nature and food security objectives. This requires fostering constructive engagement between Member States on sensitive issues such as farm income support, the greening of the sector and the transition of the livestock systems towards more sustainability and higher animal welfare. 3. Paving the way for more sustainable Livestock and Protein production in Europe The European Commission is also expected to publish a new EU Protein Plan and a Livestock Strategy shortly before the start of the Irish Presidency. These offer important opportunities to accelerate Europe’s shift towards a more extensive and sustainable livestock sector with higher animal welfare outcomes and a more balanced and resilient protein system, one less dependent on imports and more aligned with environmental, health and strategic autonomy objectives. Ireland should prioritize early Council work on these files and consider adopting council conclusions on these matters. On the Livestock Strategy it will be key to transition towards a more extensive and higher animal welfare livestock sector in the EU. It is key that under extensification also species like chickens and pigs are counted and it does not only focus on grazing for cows. For the protein plan we believe it is key that there is a focus on food and feed needs in the EU. We should not just produce more feed in the EU to build of our feed dependency but also support alternative proteins that can prove crucial for our food security."
56,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d12a6bd7/CIWF_International_-_Submission_56.docx,CIWF International,NGO,"Agriculture, Animal Welfare, Environment",EU wide,3,"The Irish Presidency has an opportunity to demonstrate that EU decision-making can deliver concrete, widely shared benefits for citizens, businesses and rural communities. For people, the Presidency can deliver progress on a strongly felt societal demand. Improving animal welfare is one of the rare issues on which Europeans express near-universal agreement (as Eurobarometer surveys consistently show). Public expectations have steadily grown, and citizens want the EU to act decisively to ensure higher, more consistent standards across Member States. By helping prepare and advance the upcoming animal-welfare legislation revision, the Irish Presidency can show that the Council responds to citizens’ priorities and aligns EU action with societal values. This sends a strong signal about an EU that listens and delivers on its promises. As 1,4 million people supported the End The Cage Age European Citizen Initiative and the EU Commission backed by many member states have committed to follow with legislation on this, we believe it crucial strong proposals banning the use of cages for all EU animals will be presented soon. This is crucial not to erode the citizens trust in the EU’s democratic tools. For businesses and farmers, harmonised standards provide long-term strategic advantages. Clear EU-wide rules provide certainty for investment, create a level playing field and enable innovation in higher-welfare production models. EU citizens expect the same animal welfare standards to apply for all products on the EU market, regardless of where they were produced. It is therefore crucial that import requirements are adopted and get enforced in order to prevent animal-based products produced with weaker animal welfare standards to be placed on the EU single market. For rural communities, the Presidency can support an agricultural transition that brings renewed opportunities. More extensive, agroecological and higher-welfare forms of farming offer significant potential to revitalise rural areas. These systems tend to require more skilled labor and due to their lower use of pesticides pose less threats to farmer and rural health outcomes. They also contribute to biodiversity recovery and nature restoration which can reinforce tourism in rural regions. By promoting policy frameworks that incentivise these models, including through CAP negotiations and work on related initiatives such as the Protein Plan and the livestock strategy, the Irish Presidency can lay groundwork for rural areas where farming is both economically viable and socially attractive, helping to address depopulation and generational renewal."
56,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d12a6bd7/CIWF_International_-_Submission_56.docx,CIWF International,NGO,"Agriculture, Animal Welfare, Environment",EU wide,4,"The Irish Presidency can also strengthen public ownership of its Presidency by demonstrating that citizens’ concerns genuinely shape the Union’s agenda. A clear example is the widespread support for stronger animal welfare rules. Championing progress on animal welfare would illustrate the added value of EU membership. Issues such as the treatment of farm animals enjoy strong public support across Europe, yet require coordinated action to deliver meaningful change. As a member state, Ireland can help transform this public demand into concrete, Union-wide policies capable of improving the lives of billions of animals. In Ireland alone, 14,646 citizens signed the End the Cage Age initiative, calling for an end to the caging of farmed animals. By fostering constructive dialogue on the long-awaited revision of EU animal welfare legislation, the Presidency can show these citizens that their voices matter, that Ireland takes their concerns seriously, and that the democratic tools of the European Union truly work. By visibly advancing files that resonate with citizens, the Irish Presidency can show that the EU is not a distant institution but a democratic project in which people’s priorities can be heard, supported, and turned into real outcomes."
56,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d12a6bd7/CIWF_International_-_Submission_56.docx,CIWF International,NGO,"Agriculture, Animal Welfare, Environment",EU wide,5,"In addition to the priorities outlined above, we encourage the Irish Presidency to foster constructive and forward-looking discussions on the future of Europe’s oceans, fisheries and aquaculture. Two major initiatives are expected during or shortly after the term of the Presidency: the Commission’s Vision 2040 for Fisheries and Aquaculture (Q3 2026) and the forthcoming Ocean Act (Q4 2026). Both will shape the long-term direction of EU marine governance and provide important opportunities for coherence across environmental, economic and animal-welfare objectives. The Vision 2040 initiative will set the strategic trajectory for fisheries and aquaculture over the next decade and beyond. We encourage the Presidency to support early, inclusive dialogue on how these sectors can remain competitive while transitioning towards genuinely sustainable and resilient practices. This should include consideration of stock restoration, the transition to low trophic and non-carnivorous aquacultural practices, and fair global supply chains. Crucially, as scientific understanding advances, discussions should also take into account growing evidence on fish welfare, ensuring that future policies reflect both societal expectations and the biological needs of aquatic animals. It is crucial to develop specie specific regulations for the different farmed fish species. Similarly, the Ocean Act will be central to shaping Europe’s broader ocean governance framework. The Presidency can play a valuable role by encouraging Member States to exchange on ambitious approaches to protecting marine ecosystems, strengthening resilience to climate impacts and improving the long-term health of European seas. The Ocean Act must empower Europe to develop a maritime sector anchored in sustainability and strategic autonomy."
316,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/81f0e3eb/NOVAS_-_Submission_316.docx,NOVAS,,,,1,"Ireland’s upcoming European Presidency provides a significant opportunity to shape the EU’s emerging housing agenda at a time of acute crisis across member states. With the appointment of the first EU Housing Commissioner and a growing consensus on housing affordability and homelessness as crossborder challenges, Ireland is well positioned to lead a Presidency defined by social ambition, practical cooperation and the legislative and policy reform required for meaningful change. Combined, the Affordable Housing Plan and the Anti-Poverty Strategy provide a powerful mandate for the Irish Government to focus on ending homelessness and enhancing the supply of public housing across Europe. Some elements the government should focus on are: 1. Make Housing Affordability a Core EU Social Priority The New Housing Commissioner has signalled a clear focus on affordability, recognising that soaring rents, insufficient public housing and instability in private markets are shared and growing European issues. Ireland should champion a Council agenda that frames housing as vital social infrastructure and a high-functioning housing system as the cornerstone of Europe’s social fabric and economic progression. The Presidency should advocate for a coordinated EU approach to expanding affordable and social housing, building on current momentum. Eight years ago, the EU made housing a social right, it is time to activate this pledge. Ensure that public housing is accessible to people experiencing homelessness From the Irish experience, we know that additional social and affordable housing does not automatically reduce homelessness. During Housing for All, more than 130,000 public homes were procured. In the same period, homelessness increased to unprecedented levels. Public housing, in and of itself, does not reduce homelessness. Housing supply must reflect the needs of homeless households. For example, in Ireland we need one-bed units for single adults and four/five bed houses for large families, cohorts that spend the longest time in emergency accommodation. During its tenure, Ireland must work towards gearing public housing for households who are homeless, in terms of property type and in terms of ringfencing housing allocations. EU agreement on this principle and the development of pan-European strategies to link public housing to homeless households will reduce overall homeless figures. Lead on Ending Homelessness Through an EU-wide Implementation Framework The Lisbon Declaration (2021), which Ireland signed, committed Member States to ending homelessness by 2030. Currently, with rising homeless figures in Ireland and across the EU, this seems out of reach. But homelessness is solvable. Ireland can use the Presidency to transform the declaration from aspiration to reality by leading the development of a practical implementation and monitoring framework. This should include: Common indicators on homelessness and housing exclusion. Targeted approaches to preventing homelessness and reoccurring homelessness: universal prevention, upstream prevention, crisis-stage prevention, emergency-stage prevention and repeat prevention. A shared European data platform to support evidence-based policymaking."

In the last decade, house prices across Europe have increased by 24%, while rents in major cities have almost doubled during the same period. While bound together, solving homelessness requires targeted measures beyond housing relating to health, social inclusion, and life skills. Some policy areas the Irish presidency should focus on include: Create an EU-level Housing First Framework Housing First works in Ireland, in Europe and across North America. It has universally high success rates in supporting tenants to maintain housing. Households traditionally considered difficult to house continue to live independently in Housing First tenancies. Much of this is due to the integrated approach from statutory and voluntary organisations across housing, health and social inclusion. The European Commission already prioritise evidence, mutual learning and finance for homelessness; the Irish Council Presidency can convert learning and momentum into solid Council recommendations and encourage national strategies aligned to Housing First. Ireland should aim to develop Council recommendation endorsing Housing First as a priority approach to ending homelessness, strengthening the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH). Develop a common definition of homelessness and data gathering The Irish presidency should commit to developing a common EU definition of homelessness, a common data-gathering framework for homelessness (indicators, methodology, profile etc.) and a roadmap to end rough sleeping across Europe. This will help us to understand why people rough sleep (capacity, exclusions, vulnerabilities etc.) and enable Europe to finance targeted and evidence-based responses to ending homelessness. Reduce bottlenecks that block supply Cumbersome planning rules raise costs and elongate delivery times for housing delivery. The Presidency can convene Member States to agree common best practice and encourage faster (and greener) planning rules. Under Ireland’s presidency the EU Council should commence a process to streamline social and affordable housing permissions, with mutual recognition of planning best practices and guidance on balancing speed, transparency and environmental protection. Promote an EU approach to short-term rental lettings and platforms Holiday and short-term letting across Europe, particularly large European cities, reduces the supply and increases the cost of long-term rentals. In Ireland, during the Covid pandemic, there was a significant decline in family homelessness (particularly in Dublin), as short-term letting ground to a halt, with landlords subsequently providing transitional tenancies to the DRHE for families experiencing homelessness. The Council, working with other EU structures, should focus on a common approach to reporting and capping levels of short-term letting across Europe, to create a sustainable and accessible rental market for the citizens of larger European cities. Building on the EU Short-Term Rental Regulations, Ireland can prioritise implementation and monitoring. In brief, Ireland should: Secure a Council recommendation on Housing First targets and implementation Create a common definition of and data gathering strategies of homelessness Streamline affordable and social planning rules across the EU Promote and EU approach to short-term rental and letting platforms"

Extensive and growing rates of homelessness undermine the social fabric of member states and deprive citizens of their social and human rights. By using Ireland’s EU presidency to reduce homelessness and accelerate the supply of public housing, we will create social solidarity, inclusion and a thriving economy across Europe. The Irish Presidency in 2026 can secure substantial and tangible benefits for Europeans by steering the Council towards actions that directly improve housing affordability and reduce homelessness. While the Lisbon Treaty places primary responsibility for housing with Member States, the EU can play a crucial enabling role through funding, coordination, and evidence-based policy. The Presidency can maximise impact through some core priorities. 1. Ending homelessness through a common EU framework and common data-gathering Rough sleeping and hidden homelessness remain growing challenges in multiple Member States. Building on Ireland’s national Housing First expertise, the Presidency can secure a Council recommendation endorsing Housing First as the preferred approach, supported by preventative measures and integrated health and social services. Establishing an EU-wide statistical framework on homelessness—common definitions, indicators and reporting cycles—would allow the Council and the Commission to track progress, direct funding more effectively, and strengthen accountability. Better data, combined with shared best practice, can materially improve outcomes for vulnerable communities. 2. Supporting communities and local economies by improving rental market fairness Short-term rental growth has reduced long-term rental supply in many European cities, affecting workers, local businesses and neighbourhood cohesion. The Irish Presidency can lead Council discussions on platform transparency, registration systems and tax cooperation—non-binding but practical steps that help Member States manage local housing pressures while supporting sustainable tourism and digital-platform innovation."

207,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/64d7edbc/Friends_of_the_Irish_Environment_-_Submission_207.docx,Friends of the Irish Environment,,,,1,"Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE) recommends Resilience as the overarching theme for Ireland’s 2026 Presidency, expressed through a slogan such as “Resilient Together.” This theme reflects growing environmental, social and economic volatility across Europe and highlights the need to strengthen the natural, social, territorial and democratic systems that sustain wellbeing. Across the EU, citizens are already experiencing the consequences of climate change, biodiversity collapse, pollution and unstable supply chains. Communities affected by storms, flooding and environmental degradation continue to demonstrate solidarity, adaptability and creativity. These experiences show that resilience emerges from strong ecosystems, empowered communities and effective public institutions working together. Ireland’s Presidency can therefore provide leadership by advancing a positive, future-oriented programme grounded in three mutually reinforcing priorities. 1. Environmental and Ecological Resilience Healthy ecosystems underpin climate stability, food security, water quality and economic prosperity. Strengthening environmental resilience should therefore be a core priority of the Presidency. Ireland should champion full implementation of the European Green Deal, including nature restoration, clean water, zero-pollution objectives, climate adaptation and biodiversity protection. A resilient Europe requires robust environmental law, grounded in scientific evidence and applied consistently across Member States. As political pressure grows to weaken EU environmental rules, Ireland can lead by ensuring that regulatory “simplification” enhances clarity and enforceability rather than reducing environmental safeguards. A Presidency focused on ecological resilience also provides an opportunity to embed nature-based solutions, sustainable land-use planning, climate-proofed infrastructure and long-term adaptation across all sectors. This reflects the growing recognition that environmental protection is central to societal and economic security. 2. Democratic, Community and Territorial Resilience Environmental resilience depends on strong democracies, engaged citizens and transparent decisionmaking. Communities must be supported to participate meaningfully in shaping the transitions affecting them. Ireland should use its Presidency to strengthen public access to environmental information, participation and justice, in line with the Aarhus Convention. Protecting civic space, supporting environmental defenders and ensuring open governance across the EU are essential for building trust and enabling fair, science-based decision-making. A community-centred approach also requires recognising the crucial role of local and regional authorities in delivering climate action, nature protection, spatial planning, sustainable mobility and place-based development. Strengthening multi-level governance and territorial cohesion will improve environmental outcomes, support healthy placemaking and reinforce democratic legitimacy. 3. Economic and Just Transition Resilience A resilient Europe requires a fair, well-funded and legally certain transition to a sustainable economy. The Presidency should support adequate EU funding for climate action, biodiversity restoration, rural development, innovation, skills and community-led transition. Rather than deregulation, Europe’s businesses and communities need predictable, science-based rules that support innovation, competitiveness and long-term planning. Ireland can play a leadership role in ensuring the next Multiannual Financial Framework and EU packages—such as the Circular Economy Act and the 2040 climate framework—maintain environmental integrity while delivering visible benefits for people. A Just Transition focused on fairness, participation, regional opportunity and community wellbeing will strengthen Europe’s social fabric and economic stability."
207,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/64d7edbc/Friends_of_the_Irish_Environment_-_Submission_207.docx,Friends of the Irish Environment,,,,2,"FIE propose a particular focus on the following policy and legislative areas and outcomes: Simplification must reinforce, not weaken, EU standards The Commission’s current focus on simplifying EU regulation presents a genuine opportunity to improve clarity, accessibility and administrative efficiency. As recognised in EU Treaties and recent jurisprudence, however, simplification must remain entirely consistent with the Union’s obligations under Articles 3(3) TEU, 11 and 191 TFEU, and Article 37 of the Charter to ensure a high level of environmental protection and continuous improvement. Any reform must therefore maintain or strengthen environmental integrity and legal certainty. Regulatory certainty supports innovation and competitiveness Clear, evidence-based standards benefit responsible businesses, investors and citizens. While some actors use the political moment to advocate broad deregulation, EU institutions and experts continue to underline that weakening standards increases uncertainty, rewards laggards and penalises those already investing in the transition. Judicial findings across Europe also show that vague or diluted criteria lead to inconsistent and often unlawful decision-making. Simplification should therefore enhance the clarity, enforceability and scientific grounding of rules rather than dilute them. A leadership opportunity for the Irish Presidency The Irish Presidency has both a responsibility and an opportunity to uphold the EU’s tradition of forwardlooking, high-quality standard-setting. By supporting simplification that improves usability while preserving environmental integrity, Ireland can help safeguard public trust, provide regulatory certainty for businesses, and reinforce the EU’s long-term sustainability and competitiveness. A future-proof Multiannual Financial Framework The next MFF must ensure adequate, dedicated funding to meet existing legal obligations and societal needs. This includes: Nature restoration, delivered in partnership with farmers, communities and environmental stakeholders; Economically, socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture, including fully funded rural development programmes; Active citizenship and civil society, including continued support for LIFE, recognising the value of public participation affirmed in recent ECtHR jurisprudence These investments enhance resilience, compliance and community-led transition. Circular Economy Act: Practical benefits for people and business A well-designed Circular Economy Act can deliver visible gains: reducing built-in obsolescence, strengthening the right to repair, enhancing supply chain security, and supporting more sustainable resource use. Clear, measurable, science-based criteria—aligned with existing EU law—will help ensure the Act drives innovation and consumer confidence. 2040 Climate Package: Continuity, clarity and fairness The 2040 climate framework will shape Europe’s pathway to climate neutrality. Consistent with recent rulings such as Klimaseniorinnen, EU climate governance must rely on quantified pathways, timely action and structured engagement with scientific evidence. The package should therefore preserve the integrity of the existing regime, avoid creating new loopholes, and deliver a fair, transparent transition that addresses citizens’ material concerns—both legally and socially essential."
207,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/64d7edbc/Friends_of_the_Irish_Environment_-_Submission_207.docx,Friends of the Irish Environment,,,,3,"The most substantial positive impact the Irish Presidency can make is to ensure that EU decision-making is grounded in the lived realities of Europe’s people, regions, and local communities. This requires embedding the principles of subsidiarity, territorial cohesion, environmental resilience, and democratic participation across the Council’s work. When local and regional actors are involved early and meaningfully, EU policy becomes more effective, better implemented, and more trusted. A first priority should be strengthening multi-level governance. Local and regional authorities are central to delivering the EU’s climate, biodiversity, spatial planning, mobility, water, housing, and public service objectives. The Presidency can champion their systematic involvement in shaping national and EU positions, ensuring that territorial expertise informs negotiations. This would help produce legislation that is practical, proportionate, implementable and responsive to different regional starting points. Supporting structured dialogue with civil society, social partners, community organisations and business networks will further embed democratic legitimacy and improve policy outcomes. The Presidency also has an opportunity to reinforce environmental and ecological resilience as foundations of long-term wellbeing and economic stability. Council processes should uphold the EU’s high environmental standards and avoid any dilution that would undermine public health, biodiversity, climate mitigation or adaptation. Clear, science-based and enforceable rules provide regulatory certainty—benefiting responsible businesses, investors and communities—and support a fair and competitive internal market. Embedding environmental integrity across all Council work will help safeguard water resources, restore nature, improve air quality and strengthen Europe’s ability to withstand growing climate risks. A third area of impact is advancing a fair, well-funded and legally predictable transition. The Presidency should work to secure an ambitious Multiannual Financial Framework that provides sufficient resources for climate action, nature restoration, sustainable agriculture, regional development, innovation, skills and community-led transition. Adequate, targeted funding enhances resilience, supports competitiveness, and ensures that no region or community is left behind as Europe accelerates towards climate neutrality. The Presidency can also add value by promoting coherence across EU initiatives—particularly the Circular Economy Act and the 2040 climate framework—to ensure they reinforce rather than undermine one another. This means championing policies that reduce waste, strengthen the right to repair, enhance supply chain resilience, and deliver climate action in a way that is fair, transparent and attentive to people’s material concerns. Finally, the work of the Council can make a major difference by reinforcing open governance, transparency and access to information. Ensuring strong public rights to participation and justice strengthens trust, supports evidence-based decisions, and empowers communities to play an active role in shaping Europe’s future. By combining territorial expertise, strong environmental governance, subsidiarity, and a fair transition, the Irish Presidency can help deliver EU policies that produce meaningful, lasting benefits for people, businesses and communities across all regions."
207,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/64d7edbc/Friends_of_the_Irish_Environment_-_Submission_207.docx,Friends of the Irish Environment,,,,4,"The most effective way to communicate the values and benefits of EU membership is to demonstrate how EU law and policy have already tangibly improved life in Ireland and other countries. The upcoming Presidency should highlight concrete, relatable examples that show the EU as a practical force for cleaner environments, stronger rights, and healthier communities. Environmental protection offers some of the clearest examples. EU nature legislation has transformed how Ireland safeguards its bogs, woodlands and coastlines, protecting landscapes that are central to national identity. The Birds and Habitats Directives have created binding duties to protect important species and habitats, resulting in stronger oversight, clearer standards, and greater accountability when environmental rules are not followed. The new Nature Restoration Law goes further by requiring the active repair of damaged ecosystems, offering long-term benefits for biodiversity, climate resilience, and community well-being. Another significant achievement is the improvement of water quality. EU water and marine laws have raised expectations for Ireland’s rivers, lakes and coastal waters, driving investment in wastewater treatment and requiring action on pollution sources. These directives have helped revive rivers, make beaches safer, and protect drinking water, ensuring that environmental quality is not a luxury but a legal right. EU planning rules have also empowered people and communities. Requirements for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) ensure that major projects are properly evaluated before they proceed. These rules embed sustainability into infrastructure and landuse decisions and guarantee public participation, with courts reinforcing that communities must be meaningfully heard. This helps citizens understand that the EU is not distant—it is shaping decisions that affect towns, housing, transport and local environments directly. Equally important is the EU’s role in promoting transparency. The Access to Information on the Environment Directive enables anyone to request environmental information from public bodies. This right has strengthened accountability, supported investigative journalism, and empowered communities to identify environmental issues, challenge poor decision-making, and demand better outcomes. It exemplifies the EU’s commitment to openness and democratic participation. The EU has also driven major improvements in waste management. Past shortcomings in Ireland’s waste and landfill practices were addressed only after EU intervention, resulting in stricter regulations, safer waste handling and cleaner communities. This demonstrates that EU enforcement can turn local concerns into national progress, making visible improvements in environmental quality and public health. Communicating these successes should rely on accessible storytelling, not technical language. Using real locations, communities, and stories will show that EU action has shaped Ireland’s natural environment, public services and democratic rights. Citizen ownership can be deepened through regional events, workshops, school and university engagements, cultural initiatives, and public dialogues that invite people to participate in shaping Ireland’s Presidency priorities. Ultimately, the message should be simple: EU membership has delivered cleaner water, protected nature, strengthened public rights, improved planning, and supported transparency. Ireland’s Presidency is an opportunity to highlight these achievements and involve citizens directly in shaping the next chapter of Ireland’s place in Europe."
207,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/64d7edbc/Friends_of_the_Irish_Environment_-_Submission_207.docx,Friends of the Irish Environment,,,,5,"As Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026, we must strengthen domestic compliance and governance with EU environmental law. Ireland is currently subject to a significant number of infringement proceedings for failures to fully transpose, implement, or enforce EU directives. These include active referrals to the Court of Justice concerning wastewater treatment obligations, delays in revising river basin and flood risk management plans, and insufficient protection of priority habitats. Additional proceedings remain ongoing in areas such as renewable energy permitting, environmental assessment, nature conservation, and water pollution control. The scale and persistence of these actions highlight structural shortcomings that require urgent and coordinated attention. A Member State entrusted with chairing the Council’s legislative work must demonstrate adherence to the Union’s legal framework. Effective stewardship depends on credibility: a Presidency that guides negotiations on climate, nature restoration, pollution prevention, and circular-economy measures must be seen as upholding these same standards at home. Continued non-compliance risks undermining Ireland’s influence, eroding trust in environmental governance, and exposing the State to financial penalties and reputational harm. Strengthening compliance should therefore be considered an integral component of Ireland’s Presidency preparation. Key actions include adequate resourcing, especially of areas subject to long term underinvestment such as sewage treatment and nature protection; reinforcing administrative capacity within departments and regulatory bodies; improving coordination with local authorities responsible for implementation; ensuring transposition processes are timely, complete and scientifically robust; and embedding transparency, public participation and access to justice, consistent with the Aarhus Convention. Many of Ireland’s current infringements reflect delays, inconsistent application of standards, or gaps in monitoring and enforcement—issues that can be effectively addressed through clearer governance structures, proactive planning and adequate resourcing. Enhanced compliance will also produce tangible benefits for communities, businesses and the environment. Full and consistent implementation of EU environmental law supports cleaner water, healthier ecosystems, climate resilience, and a predictable and fair regulatory environment. It reduces long-term public expenditure by preventing environmental degradation, protecting health, and avoiding litigation. Moreover, a coherent compliance framework underpins a just transition by ensuring that environmental rules apply equally and transparently across sectors and regions. As Ireland enters a period of heightened responsibility within the EU, demonstrating leadership through strong domestic governance is both necessary and advantageous. By resolving long-standing infringements, improving enforcement systems, and ensuring that environmental decisions are grounded in clear evidence and meaningful public participation, Ireland can show its commitment to the Union’s values and reinforce the legitimacy of its Presidency. The 2026 Presidency will offer Ireland a critical platform to highlight the benefits of ambitious, enforceable environmental standards and to advance resilient, science-based policymaking across the Union. To use that platform effectively, Ireland must ensure its implementation framework fully aligns with EU law and meets a high standard of environmental protection. Strengthening domestic compliance is therefore essential to the credibility, authority, and success of the Irish Presidency."

I commend Ireland’s proactive stance in developing its own legislation on the Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) through the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill 2025, as already implemented in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Cyprus, Italy, Slovenia, as well as Monaco. Building upon this timely domestic development, which uniquely positions Ireland to lead the effort to ensure that all cancer survivors are no longer penalised for their medical history, I urge the Irish Presidency to focus on Cancer Survivorship and the Quality of Life of Cancer Survivors. Thanks to the tremendous progress of medicine in the last decades, cancer is no longer a death sentence, and more citizens are able to enjoy a good quality of life. The proportions of cancer survivors are increasing of 3% on a yearly basis and in 2020 more than 20 million cancer survivors have been estimated in Europe. However, despite these significant medical advancements, these individuals frequently face systemic and often invisible discrimination. The latter manifest in critical areas such as access to financial services (e.g., life insurance, mortgages, credit), employment opportunities, and even social integration. Such barriers undermine their ability to fully reintegrate into society, contribute to the economy, and live lives free from the punitive consequences of a past illness. A major provision to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors is the Right To Be Forgotten. The latter allows cancer survivors to no longer be penalised for their medical history. It mandates that banks and insurers disregard oncological medical history five years after the end of treatment, provided there is no relapse. This ensures that financial assessments are based on current health status, enabling survivors to regain equitable access to financial services essential for social reintegration. During its Presidency, I encourage Ireland to place Cancer Survivorship as a high-level thematic priority, to directly address a critical societal challenge impacting millions of EU citizens. This priority aligns with fundamental European values of social justice, equality, and health equity, but also touches upon economic participation, consumer protection, and the functioning of the single market by removing discriminatory barriers."
54,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6edfa267/Ending_Discrimination_Against_Cancer_Survivors_EDACS_-_Submission_54.docx,Ending Discrimination Against Cancer Survivors (EDACS),,,,2,"The Right to Be Forgotten has gained increasing recognition at the EU level as a key instrument to combat financial discrimination against cancer survivors. Although progress has been made, notably through, the recognition of the RTBF in the Beating Cancer Plan, and the inclusion of the latter in the Consumer Credit Directive, much remains to be done to harmonise and ensure legislation in all Member States and beyond. Addressing Cancer Survivorship and the Right To Be Forgotten, aligns perfectly with the broader European commitment outlined in Europe's Beating Cancer Plan (EBCP). Launched with the objective to tackle the entire cancer pathway, the EBCP explicitly recognises the need to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors and directly calls for action on the Right to Be Forgotten under its sixth flagship 'Improving the quality of life of cancer patients and survivors'. The Irish Presidency should continue to capitalise on the strategic framework and political impetus of the European Cancer Beating Plan (EBCP), ensuring its robust and continued implementation at the EU level. This includes driving the harmonisation of the end of financial discrimination against cancer survivors, especially considering the initiative laid out in the Plan, namely a Code of Conduct, has failed. As of December 2025, nine EU Member States (France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Cyprus, Italy, Slovenia) have adopted binding legal measures around the 'Right to Be Forgotten' (RTBF). In addition to Ireland and Luxembourg’s ongoing legislative efforts for the Right to Be Forgotten, three more Member States (Denmark, Greece, and Czech Republic) have introduced non-legislative measures such as codes of conduct. Beyond the EBCP, we encourage the Irish Presidency to support the effective implementation of the Consumer Credit Directive and to advocate for a reconsideration of the revision of the Mortgage Credit Directive in order to include the RTBF with a five-year limit applicable to all cancer survivors without relapse. More broadly, the Irish Presidency should advocate for the inclusion of anti-discrimination safeguards for cancer survivors across all EU initiatives that address financial exclusion, barriers to adoption, and obstacles to workforce reintegration. Most importantly, besides European frameworks, the Irish Presidency, building upon the legitimacy stemming from its domestic legislative development for the Right To Be Forgotten, should push its counterpart Member States for the adoption of national legislation guaranteeing a single, reasonable timeframe of five years after the completion of treatment, free from cancer-related discrimination. This legislation should be based on proven best practices, such as the French and Belgian models, and should include exception frameworks (with shorter timeframes) for certain types of cancer, adapted to local realities and reflecting ongoing medical progress."

Indeed, while cancer is no longer a life sentence, recovery often entails lifelong discrimination due to medical history records. Difficulties securing employment, accessing vital financial services such as life insurance, travel insurance, loans, and mortgages, create an unjust double sentence. Such discriminations jeopardise the European values of equality, non-discrimination, and social inclusion, and undermine key objectives of fostering an inclusive Single Market, combating poverty, upholding consumer rights, ensuring fair working conditions and social protection. The recognition of RTBF is therefore not a matter of empathy; it is a matter of justice and human rights for European citizens."

Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Re s i l i ent and P r ep ar ed Eur op e The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community- level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events.

The EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 emphasises resilience, competitiveness, sustainability and skills; these themes deeply resonate with the concerns of Irish people, from rural communities to vibrant urban centres. To connect citizens meaningfully with Ireland’s Presidency, communication must make these priorities tangible, relatable, and locally rooted. Tell Ireland’s EU story in an Irish voice People respond to narratives that feel authentic and familiar. Ireland’s EU journey—from peace building to economic transformation, from workers’ rights to regional development—should be retold through voices that citizens trust: community leaders, small business owners, tourism workers, artists, farmers, students. Communicating the Presidency can draw from the Irish tradition of storytelling, making complex EU policy accessible through personal experience, local case studies, and cultural expression. Show—not just tell—the benefits of EU membership Citizens engage most when they see real-world impact. Ireland can highlight local successes linked to EU cooperation: sustainable tourism initiatives, skills and training supports, environmental protection, research partnerships, heritage preservation, and rural development. Pop-up exhibitions, travelling “EU in Your Community” roadshows, and partnerships with libraries, GAA clubs, and festivals can bring the EU into everyday public spaces. Create participatory, citizen-led Presidency initiatives A sense of ownership grows when people are active participants rather than observers. Ireland can host allisland citizens’ dialogues, youth assemblies, and community innovation challenges linked to Presidency themes such as sustainability, tourism, and digital transition. Schools and universities could engage through EU Presidency learning modules, student ambassador programmes, and project competitions tied to real EU policy questions. This supports the EU Strategic Agenda’s priority on skills and civic engagement. Celebrate Ireland’s role in shaping Europe’s future Citizens should see Ireland not just as a beneficiary of the EU, but as a contributor. Communicating flagship Presidency initiatives—such as the Dublin Declaration on Future Ready Tourism, the European Tourism Innovation Research & Development Hub, and the EU Tourism Training & Skills Portal—can demonstrate Ireland’s leadership in areas that matter to communities, businesses, and workers. These projects align with Council configurations on Competitiveness and Education, making EU policymaking more visible and relatable to Irish audiences. Use culture as a bridge to Europe Culture is often the most powerful connector. Irish artists, creators, venues, and festivals can be mobilised to express the themes of the Presidency—welcome, sustainability, innovation, community—through music, literature, film and public art. Cultural exchange with Lithuania and Greece, our Trio partners, can showcase shared European values in a way that policy statements alone cannot. Keep communication simple, human, and hopeful Above all, messages should focus on what the EU enables: opportunity, mobility, peace, environmental protection, cultural richness, and economic security. Ireland’s Presidency should be framed as a national moment—a chance for citizens to help steer Europe at a time when our collective future is being shaped."

As an Irish and European citizen with decades of experience across national, EU and global tourism, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to Ireland’s preparations for the 2026 EU Council Presidency. Tourism is one of Europe’s most culturally meaningful and economically vital sectors, and Ireland—with our instinct for welcome and our growing reputation in innovation—can play a pivotal role in shaping Europe’s future under the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, which prioritises competitiveness, resilience, sustainability, and skills. Guided by these priorities, and aligned with the Council’s legislative programme and the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme—particularly its strands on sustainability, digital transition, European competitiveness, and skills development—I propose the following three legacy projects for the Ireland– Lithuania–Greece Trio Presidency. These projects also support the work of the Competitiveness Council (Tourism policy and the single market) and the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council (skills and training). Legacy Project 1 — The Dublin Declaration on FUTURE READY TOURISM - UNITE, ELEVATE, INNOVATE, and ACCELERATE In line with the EU Strategic Agenda’s call for improved governance and long-term strategic coordination, the Dublin Declaration would establish a modernised EU tourism governance framework. It would: Strengthen cross-directorate coordination within the European Commission; Introduce a Tourism Mainstreaming Protocol to align with the Commission’s 2026 legislative priorities; • Establish a long-term Tourism Governance Council, operating within the Competitiveness Council’s remit; Deliver a 2036 EU Tourism Roadmap aligned with green and digital transition goals. Legacy Impact: A durable governance structure for tourism, giving the EU the coordination capacity it needs to deliver the 2024–2029 Strategic Agenda and future legislative cycles. Legacy Project 2 — European Tourism Innovation Research & Development Hub Aligned with the Strategic Agenda’s emphasis on innovation and competitiveness, —headquartered digitally in Dublin—would be Europe’s first permanent tourism research and innovation online hub. It would: Integrate tourism into the EU’s research fabric, supporting the Commission’s 2026 R&I priorities; Advance innovation in digital heritage, AI, and climate-neutral mobility; Offer applied research fellowships; Operate a Trio Knowledge Lab connecting Ireland, Lithuania, and Greece. Legacy Impact: A world-leading EU tourism research ecosystem supporting the Competitiveness Council’s mandate and strengthening Europe’s innovation capacity. Legacy Project 3 — EU Tourism Prosperity Training & Skills Hub Reflecting the Strategic Agenda’s commitment to a skilled workforce and resilient communities, this online Hub—developed through the Education & Youth Council’s skills mandate—would: • Provide training in sustainable tourism, mobility innovation, cultural stewardship, and digital"

Driving a future that delivers for coming generations at the heart of its thematic priorities would signal the EU’s commitment to purposeful, people-centred action. Health is central to this vision it enables citizens to learn, work, and participate fully in society, reinforcing social stability, economic vitality, and the foundations of a strong, sustainable Europe for decades to come. Health has been largely absent for high-level thematical frameworks, with Belgium’s Presidency a notable exception in explicitly prioritising the health agenda. This gap is striking given that non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD), remain the leading cause of mortality in Europe, driving long-term disability, caregiver burden, avoidable hospital pressure, and sustained economic loss through premature death and preventable illness. Ireland has an opportunity to position health, not as a technical sector issue, but as a strategic pillar essential to Europe’s resilience. Prevention specifically reduces long-term healthcare costs that strain national budgets, and addresses health inequalities strengthening social cohesion. The ongoing development of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan presents a unique opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate leadership in key prevention areas such as obesity and nicotine addiction, but also in delivering EU-wide improvements to acute care systems, rehabilitation and community services promoting health and wellbeing for CVD patients. Ireland has a well-established domestic track record in prevention, population-level health advocacy, and public health awareness. Our cardiovascular care community is also highly respected throughout Europe for its expertise and innovation. This gives us unique credibility in elevating both prevention and care focused discussions at European level. The Presidency term therefore represents an important agenda-setting moment to: Prioritise cardiovascular disease, which is Europe’s biggest killer disease, across the full spectrum of prevention, emergency care, rehabilitation and support in the community. Seek greater protection for children from detrimental commercial drivers of disease, including through the audiovisual and digital marketing environment. Develop programmes to improve the lives of tens of millions of people living with the effects of CVD, including by upholding their rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities. Emphasise environmental policy as a direct contributor to long-term cardiovascular health, community participation and economic productivity. A Presidency that prioritises health does not simply improve outcomes for patients, it strengthens the EU’s broader policy objectives preventing avoidable mortality, reducing inequalities, protecting future generations, and supporting citizens to live, learn, and work well for longer. Embedding a Presidency focus on future generations, with health as a key thematic pillar, would show how EU policy can complement national efforts, protect health across all policy areas, and advance a stronger Health Union. This approach recognises longevity and wellbeing as core European assets and underscores that Europe’s future strength depends not just on treating illness, but on preventing it effectively, equitably, and sustainably at scale."
373,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/4ef49834/Irish_Heart_Foundation__-_Submission_373.docx,Irish Heart Foundation,NGO,Heart and Stroke Organisation,National,2,"CVD requires particular priority given significant deficits in services and supports throughout the EU despite being by far its biggest cause of mortality, accounting for one third of all deaths. Failure to do more to address the needs of an estimated 62 million people living with a cardiovascular condition is also driving high levels of long-term disability, caregiver burden, avoidable hospital pressure, and sustained economic loss through premature death and preventable illness. In Ireland it’s estimated that around 10,000 people die of cardiovascular disease each year, with 600,000 people living with CV conditions. The Irish Government is demonstrating strong commitment to better cardiovascular health outcomes through key actions: implementing the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services and National Stroke Strategy, delivering a new National Cardiovascular Health Policy, signing the Stroke Action Plan for Europe, and playing a prominent role in securing the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan - all of which will make a real difference to citizens' lives. This provides a strong foundation for the Irish Presidency to play a leadership role in shaping a healthier future for EU citizens. Below we outline areas of highest policy importance and what constructive progress could represent for citizens and communities should these files land on the Council agenda in 2026. Cardiovascular Prevention The EU burden of heart disease and stroke demonstrates the importance of comprehensive prevention policy that links modifiable risk factors to long-term health outcomes. Specific EU actions to support efforts by member Governments to tackle Europe’s obesity crisis and to reduce persistently high rates of smoking and nicotine addiction include: Measures to reduce consumption of ultraprocessed foods, including designing EU-wide levies on unhealthy products and subsidies for healthy food. The introduction of mandatory front of pack labelling providing clear information to consumers on the nutritional value of food products and beverages. A full review of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive to provide greater protection from unhealthy food marketing, which is driving Europe's childhood obesity crisis through traditional advertising and the growing influence of content creators and influencers. Accelerating the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive and its extension to protect children from nicotine addiction through use of e-cigarettes and other novel products Improved treatment, care and support The EU can play an important role in reducing high levels of preventable death and disability from CVD that persist in every EU State through: The development of an EU-wide programme to support all Member States in developing or upgrading national cardiovascular health strategies. This should include implementation of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan and the Stroke Action Plan for Europe. Programmes to reduce inequalities in women’s cardiovascular health. Research to assess and mitigate the financial impact of CVD on patients and their families, long-term psychological impacts and to develop cost effective pathways of community services and supports."
373,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/4ef49834/Irish_Heart_Foundation__-_Submission_373.docx,Irish Heart Foundation,NGO,Heart and Stroke Organisation,National,3,"Ireland’s Presidency term can make the strongest social and economic impact by emphasising: Prevention at scale, protection of children, inclusive public policy, and healthier environments, recognising these areas as structural drivers of EU credibility and resilience. Addressing the needs of the 62 million people living with a cardiovascular condition and their families. Council discussions that visibly connect obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, nicotine dependence, air quality, and physical inactivity to cardiovascular mortality would underscore the EU's role in preventing the Union's largest cause of premature death. Ireland should reinforce the importance of protecting children and future adult cardiovascular health from commercial drivers of disease. Advancing implementation of the files mentioned above would ensure people living with heart disease, stroke, and related disabilities are centred in prevention and rehabilitation policy design. Progressing the EU CVH plan would also play a signficant role in prevention as well as the treatment and care of heart disease, stroke and blood vessel diseases. The provisions focusing on living with the effects of CVD provide an opportunity to improve the health, wellbeing and quality of life of a large group of vulnerable citizens who, in broad terms, have not been well served by health and social care systems in member States to date."
373,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/4ef49834/Irish_Heart_Foundation__-_Submission_373.docx,Irish Heart Foundation,NGO,Heart and Stroke Organisation,National,4,"Making EU Membership Tangible Citizens value EU membership when they can trace a direct line between EU action and improvements in their communities. For patients and families affected by CVD, Ireland’s leading cause of death, the EU’s role is largely invisible. Making connections explicit offers a strong communication opportunity. Communicate through concrete protections The EU’s strength lies in addressing challenges that cross borders and overpower individual member states particularly where commercial interests operate across jurisdictions. Cardiovascular prevention and health protection show that EU level coordination could make tobacco advertising restrictions, controls on junk food marketing to children across digital platforms, and air quality standards that reduce cardiovascular mortality far more effective. This would prevent industry from exploiting regulatory gaps and ensure greater benefits for citizens. However, most Irish people do not recognise existing and potential daily protections as stemming from EU legislation, which represents both a communication failure and an opportunity. Build ownership through recognisable priorities Citizens develop ownership when they see their concerns genuinely reflected in what the government champions at EU level. An effective Presidency strategy would choose visible priorities that resonate with lived experience, issues including non-communicable disease prevention or disability rights implementation affect millions daily but rarely dominate political discourse. Moving beyond tick boxing exercises to meaningful involvement of patient groups, health NGOs, and civil society transform citizens from audience to participants. Championing legislative files that deliver better outcomes for current and future generations shows citizens their government is actively protecting their interests at EU level. The approach Communication should emphasise tangible results in accessible language and showcase how coordinated standards can contributed to the reduction of disease burden. Local engagement with patient groups and accessible summaries would ground the Presidency in communities’ daily concerns rather than distant institutional proceedings. Ireland’s Presidency offers a moment to demonstrate that EU membership isn’t abstract cooperation but practical protection of citizens’ health and wellbeing. Citizens develop ownership of both the Presidency and the broader EU project when they see their government championing protections that directly improve their lives."

As cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death across the Union, Ireland can demonstrate transformative leadership by championing this Plan whilst modelling a more participatory approach to EU policymaking, one that embeds civil society, community voices whilst maintaining clear boundaries between public health advocacy and commercial interests. Building the CVD Plan with community and patient voices The EU Cardiovascular Health Plan offers a concrete framework for Ireland's Presidency to advance prevention at scale. Championing this Plan means ensuring civil society, patient organisations, and health NGOs are central to shaping its implementation. Ireland should establish structured engagement mechanisms that bring these voices into Council preparatory discussions on cardiovascular health, prevention policy, and related file, ensuring public health perspectives are heard as prominently as commercial stakeholders. This means inviting patient organisations to contribute expertise during the development of Council positions; hosting roundtables that connect lived experiences of heart disease and stroke directly with Member State delegations; and ensuring people living with cardiovascular conditions and related disabilities have visible representation in Presidency events. Their lived experience reveals how policies translate into daily realities, where gaps exist, and what truly constitutes meaningful protection. Protecting policy space from commercial interests On files involving tobacco, vaping, food marketing, and product regulation, all critical to cardiovascular disease prevention, it is essential that Ireland's Presidency maintains clear separation between public health policy development and industry lobbying. Commercial actors have well-documented records of undermining health protections through regulatory delay, weakened standards, and false equivalence between public health evidence and industry-funded research. Transparency Ireland's Presidency could enhance policy integrity by being transparent about which stakeholders are consulted during Council negotiations, identifying industry representatives clearly, and prioritising independent scientific evidence over commercially motivated positions. This builds public trust and demonstrates that Council decisions serve citizen interests."

The fact that this first of its kind global celebration of volunteering coincides with Ireland’s Presidency of the EU presents a unique opportunity to shine a light on our incredible record of volunteering and cement Ireland as a leader in volunteering. Ireland has a strong culture of volunteering with over 1 million people volunteering each year. Ireland is seen as a global leader in volunteering across Europe because we have relatively high levels of volunteering, a national volunteer development organisation in Volunteer Ireland, a network of local county-based Volunteer Centres, and a Government commitment to volunteering through a National Volunteering Strategy. Volunteer Ireland has been named national lead on IVY 2026 by the United Nations. We are also members, and sit on the board, of the Centre for European Volunteering (CEV), the European network of over 60 organisations dedicated to the promotion of, and support to, volunteers and volunteering in Europe at European, national and regional level. Specifically, Ireland should focus on the following: 1. Strengthening Social Cohesion and Community Resilience Volunteering enhances solidarity, inclusion, and supports core EU values. Volunteering is a recognised driver of social cohesion (European Commission, 2023; OECD, 2020). Ireland should prioritise policy measures that invest in community infrastructure, volunteer-involving organisations, local volunteer organisations, and promote cross-border civic cooperation will reinforce Europe’s capacity to respond to social, environmental, and economic challenges. Reinforcing Democracy and Civic Participation Volunteering fosters civic skills, habits of participation, and trust in institutions (Putnam, 2000; European Parliament Research Service, 2022). Ireland should prioritise initiatives that build democratic resilience through civic engagement and community participation. With challenges such as disinformation, polarisation, and declining trust in institutions, Europe must elevate civic engagement. Volunteering provides meaningful pathways for citizens to participate in public life. Ireland should champion a European agenda that strengthens democratic resilience through greater support for civic education, community organising, and volunteer-based democratic initiatives. Promoting Inclusion and Equality Through Civic Engagement Volunteering is a proven mechanism for integrating marginalised communities, including migrants, people with disabilities, older adults, and young people. (UN Volunteers, 2018; European Economic and Social Committee, 2019). Ireland should position inclusive volunteering as a key driver of equality and social participation within the EU’s wider inclusion strategies. Building a Resilient Europe Through Preparedness and Community Response Volunteers play a central role during emergencies, from COVID-19 to natural disasters (European Commission Civil Protection Mechanism Report, 2022). Ireland should prioritise EU-wide frameworks that support the mobilisation, protection, training, and recognition of volunteers in preparedness and emergency response systems. Supporting the Future of Europe’s Civil Society A strong, independent, and well-resourced civil society sector is essential to the functioning of European democracies. (Council of Europe, 2019). The Presidency should champion strategic investment, regulatory clarity, and enabling environments for non-profit and volunteer-involving organisations and community organisations."
111,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c879bcb1/Volunteer_Ireland_-_Submission_111.docx,Volunteer Ireland,,,,2,"The Irish Presidency of the EU Council in 2026 offers a timely opportunity to recognise, support and promote the role of volunteering within the European policy landscape and to align EU initiatives with Ireland’s tradition of community engagement and volunteer-led solidarity. Ireland can use its Presidency to champion a policy vision in which volunteering is recognised as a mechanism for civic participation, democracy, resilience, population preparedness and social cohesion across the European Union. Ireland is well-positioned to advocate for sustained investment in volunteering infrastructure, both at national and European levels given its leading example in having a National Volunteering Strategy that has the provision of volunteering infrastructure at its core. Population preparedness and resilience-building should form a priority area. In Ireland and other member states, the contributions of volunteers in emergencies have clearly demonstrated the importance of a whole-of-society approach. During its Presidency, Ireland should push for stronger integration of volunteer-involving organisations within EU preparedness strategies and structures, particularly under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. This includes enhanced capacity-building for Irish and European organisations that engage volunteers in crisis response, ensuring they have the tools, training, and coordination platforms needed to operate safely and efficiently. Embedding volunteer expertise in advisory and management structures would reinforce public trust and expand the collective capacity to respond to future challenges. The Irish Presidency should advocate for volunteering and solidarity to remain at the core of the Erasmus+ programme with a clear legal and budgetary framework that recognises volunteering as a unique contribution to European unity, resilience, preparedness and democracy. The Irish Presidency should also support an increased European Solidarity Corps budget to improve the quality of experiences and better enable the inclusion of people with fewer opportunities who may require additional resources. The Irish Presidency should work on ensuring that the newly proposed AgoraEU programme explicitly recognises and addresses volunteering, to give continuity to what has been achieved through Regulation 2021/692 (establishing the CERV programme), in alignment with Article 11 TEU on participatory democracy, and as a recognition of volunteering as a key mechanism for democratic engagement, solidarity, and active participation. For Ireland, which has deeply embedded traditions of community volunteering, this is an opportunity to ensure that the EU’s new democratic engagement frameworks reflect the role of volunteers as facilitators of dialogue, social cohesion, and active citizenship. The same applies to the European Democracy Shield, where volunteer-driven engagement should be acknowledged as a key element of societal resilience against democratic threats. The role of volunteers in providing the required civic education, media literacy and critical thinking skills will be essential to its success. Ireland should also promote EU-level recognition and validation of skills gained through volunteering. Integrating volunteering into the intergenerational fairness agenda would further align European policy with Ireland’s community values. Ensuring stable, long-term funding for volunteering infrastructure will be essential to enabling safe, meaningful, and accessible participation for people of all ages across Ireland and the EU."
111,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c879bcb1/Volunteer_Ireland_-_Submission_111.docx,Volunteer Ireland,,,,3,"To deliver the most meaningful benefits to people, communities, and businesses, the Irish Presidency should prioritise initiatives that strengthen Europe’s social infrastructure—especially its volunteer-driven and community-based systems. Specifically: Putting People and Communities at the Centre of Policy Design Policies are most effective when rooted in lived experience. Public trust increases when citizens contribute to policymaking (OECD Trust Framework, 2021). Ireland can lead by embedding participatory processes including citizen panels, youth assemblies, and civil society led consultations into Council work. This enhances trust and ensures policies reflect community realities and deliver tangible benefits. Investing in Community Resilience Evidence shows volunteer networks strengthen resilience and local capacity to respond to crises (UNDRR, 2020). Supporting volunteer training and safety while ensuring volunteers, volunteer involving organisations and volunteer infrastructure bodies are included in emergency planning and frameworks is critical. Improving Wellbeing and Social Cohesion Volunteering improves mental health, reduces loneliness, and increases social ties and participation (WHO, 2021; Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies, 2017). By promoting policies that support inclusive volunteering, the Presidency can ensure that the benefits of EU membership are felt at community level. Supporting Skills and the Social Economy Volunteering develops soft and transferable skills essential to labour markets (EU Skills Agenda Report, 2022). The Presidency can advance recognition frameworks linking volunteering to education, training, and employability. Strengthening Cross-Border Mobility and Cooperation A stronger system of cross-border volunteering, crisis response, youth exchanges, and civil society cooperation will create a more connected and resilient Europe. Cross-border volunteering creates solidarity and shared European identity (Eurobarometer 2021). Strengthened mobility frameworks will benefit both communities and businesses through increased cooperation, trust and shared learning. By foregrounding volunteering and community engagement, Ireland can ensure its Presidency has a visible, people-centred impact that aligns with the EU’s founding values and long-term priorities. 6. Communicating the Value and Impact of Volunteering Volunteering is not only critical to Irish society but to communities in every Member State. The Irish Presidency provides us with a unique platform to ensure the value of volunteering is recognised and understood across the EU. Given the Irish Presidency falls during IVY 2026 it is imperative that volunteering is recognised within the EU Council as a driver of social cohesion, humanitarian effort and emergency response. It’s impact should be reflected in communications and policies throughout the Irish Presidency."

Volunteer Ireland recommends: Use Volunteering as a Visible Expression of EU Values Volunteering exemplifies solidarity, democracy, and participation, core EU values listed in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Showcasing community projects supported by EU funding, or aligned with EU priorities, helps citizens see the practical impact of EU membership in everyday life. Volunteerdriven events, local dialogues, and community action days can make EU values more visible. Highlight Community Impact Stories Research shows storytelling increases public understanding of EU action (European Commission, 2021). Sharing examples of volunteer-led community projects supported by EU programmes will resonate strongly with citizens. Positive narratives particularly those highlighting volunteers helping during crises, supporting vulnerable people, or contributing to environmental sustainability are powerful tools for demonstrating European solidarity. Engage Youth and Civil Society Youth participation and civil society involvement increase trust in EU institutions (Eurofound, 2019). Cocreating Presidency events with volunteers, volunteering infrastructure bodies, and civil society organisations ensures key stakeholders are directly involved in Presidency related events. This builds a sense of ownership over Ireland’s role in the EU and strengthens civic participation. Ensure Accessible, Inclusive Communication Clear language, multi-language materials, and community-based communication channels boost understanding and participation (FRA, 2020). Use clear, jargon-free messaging, multiple languages, and community-based communication channels to ensure that information reaches diverse audiences, including migrants, rural communities, and disadvantaged groups. Emphasise Opportunities, Not Institutions Citizens respond more positively to opportunities such as Erasmus+, European Solidarity Corps, and community funding than to institutional explanations (Eurobarometer, 2022). Focusing on tangible benefits will strengthen connection with the EU. Citizens connect more strongly with opportunities that affect them personally. Communicating about EU-funded volunteering programmes, Erasmus+ youth mobility, and community-resilience initiatives provides a relatable entry point to understanding the EU."

The General Assembly calls on Member States, United Nations system organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector and academia, to observe the International Year at national and regional levels. Every day, millions of people around the world take action – big and small – to make life better for others and for their communities. Whether it’s mentoring youth, supporting local health efforts, or responding to emergencies, volunteers drive meaningful change in communities. Through their actions, volunteers become a force for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - connecting people, strengthening resilience, and creating lasting impact. The International Volunteer Year 2026 invites us to celebrate and recognise the incredible contributions of volunteers everywhere. It’s a moment to raise awareness, spark conversations, and inspire even more people to get involved."

These issues should inform how Ireland’s Presidency is organised and how all stakeholders are engaged to ensure a disability accessible Presidency. Full participation of people with disabilities as equal stakeholders should be planned for and provided. Further, Ireland should utilise its presidency to choose ‘access’ as its high-level thematic priority, which informs all aspects of policy discussion. As an international NGO, we recommend that consultation with the people most impacted by crises, e.g., poverty, humanitarian, conflict, and climate crisis, should be a key feature of Ireland’s leadership as it holds the EU Presidency, with a focus on access and disability inclusion in Europe’s Global Gateway. As part of the EU Presidency, CBM Ireland recommends that Ireland should convene an EU high-level event focused on disability-inclusive climate action at COP31. CBM Ireland, which is part of a global federation and is present in Australia, is having a parallel conversation with the Australian government, which will lead the negotiations leading up to COP31 in Türkiye. Access to affordable housing and energy is the twin crisis experienced across the European public, which exacerbates the lives and livelihoods of people with disabilities. Ireland should use its domestic experience and expertise of the Just Transition Commission to address the key issues of the housing and energy crises, align them with the broader issues of the climate crisis, and promote affordable, accessible housing and energy, with renewables as the core principle."

We adopt a human rights approach to development and working towards sustainable, long-term change to address the root causes of poverty and injustice more effectively.",Global - our submission will focus predominately on the EU’s external action with a focus on its role in the Global South.,1,"Ireland’s Presidency comes at a time when the commitments of EU Member States is weaker in relation to human rights, international law and sustainable development. The Council’s work will be shaped by overlapping pressures — geopolitical instability, deepening humanitarian crises, fragmentation of the multilateral system, and debates about competitiveness. Against that backdrop, three priorities would allow Ireland to contribute constructively and credibly to the EU’s strategic agenda. Rebalancing the EU’s external action towards poverty reduction and human rights The redesign of the EU’s external financing instruments risks diluting the European Union’s long-standing commitment to poverty eradication, gender equality and sustainable development. A Presidency priority centred on poverty reduction, rights, and development cooperation would help ensure that the EU’s external policies remain aligned with European values. It would also signal that the shift towards a more “economic foreign policy” should not come at the expense of the Union’s obligations under Article 208 TFEU and the 2030 Agenda. Strengthening accountability and international law in EU foreign policy At a time when grave breaches of international humanitarian law are unfolding — like in the occupied Palestinian territory and in Sudan — the EU’s credibility depends on its willingness to uphold accountability and justice. A Presidency priority centered on accountability, protection of civilians, and respect for international law would show a commitment to the EU’s core values. This focus would reflect the expectations of European citizens, who consistently express strong support for EU foreign policy that prioritizes human rights. Ireland is well-placed to facilitate constructive Council discussions on how the EU applies existing legal obligations consistently across different contexts where international law has been breached. One area where this principle is urgently needed is the EU’s response to Israel’s genocide in Gaza and the wider illegal occupation. Ireland’s Presidency should support steps towards accountability, including the use of Article 2 of the EU–Israel Association Agreement, which is triggered when the essential human-rights clause is breached. Ensuring economic competitiveness aligns with social, environmental and human-rights standards Debates on competitiveness are shaping a growing share of the EU’s legislative agenda, including discussions on the Omnibus package and the future of environmental protection and wider due diligence. A Presidency focused on “competitiveness with integrity” would recognise the need for economic resilience while acknowledging that deregulation cannot come at the expense of human rights and environmental protections. When setting out its priorities, we would encourage Ireland to avoid replicating the Danish Presidency’s framing of competitiveness, which focused heavily on supply-chain security and regulatory simplification but gave little space to human rights or responsible business conduct. Along with the need to protect human rights, it’s important to also note that while proponents of deregulation claim it will unleash growth by removing “burdens” – this claim is not supported by evidence. Hundreds of economists across Europe have made clear that sustainability regulations related to due diligence do not undermine competitiveness—and that the real challenges for growth are elsewhere such as energy shocks, under-investment, weak industrial policy and skills gaps."

We adopt a human rights approach to development and working towards sustainable, long-term change to address the root causes of poverty and injustice more effectively.",Global - our submission will focus predominately on the EU’s external action with a focus on its role in the Global South.,2,"Ireland’s Presidency will coincide with several major legislative files and policy debates. In line with the above three priorities, three areas stand out as requiring attention and principled stewardship. 1. Multi Annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2028–2034 and the Global Europe Instrument Negotiations on the Global Europe Instrument (GEI) under the next MFF will define the direction of EU external action. The current proposals risk undermining the EU’s focus on poverty eradication, shifting ODA towards geopolitical and commercial objectives, and weakening commitments to gender equality. Ireland’s Presidency should work to: Anchor the GEI in poverty reduction and human rights, explicitly grounding negotiations in Article 208 TFEU and the EU’s stated values on human rights and development cooperation. Protect ODA integrity, including by resisting negative migration conditionality and ensuring that development assistance is not diverted into security or commercial export priorities. Strengthen gender equality obligations, including dedicated, measurable commitments for funding women’s rights organisations, whose share of ODA remains extremely low. Ensure climate and environmental commitments remain robust, encouraging greater ambition in the EU’s climate finance towards adaptation, mitigation, loss and damage, and a just transition. 2. Accountability and international humanitarian law: EU–Israel Association Agreement & FAC workstream The scale and gravity of violations in the occupied Palestinian territory underline the urgency of restoring credibility to the EU’s human-rights conditionality. Article 2 of the EU–Israel Association Agreement establishes that respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an “essential element” of the agreement. Given the findings of UN experts, the ICJ advisory opinion and multiple organisations, the Presidency should support the Council initiating the formal process to suspend the EU–Israel Association Agreement until Israel complies with its obligations under international law. More broadly the Irish Presidency should work within the Foreign Affairs Council to ensure a consistent application of EU human-rights conditionality across all third countries, including in cases of grave breaches of humanitarian law, attacks on civilians and obstruction of humanitarian access. 3. Competitiveness, due diligence and the deregulatory agenda The Omnibus proposals and related discussions on “competitiveness” have major implications for human rights, environmental standards and the EU’s global footprint. Despite evidence that shows that the implementation cost of human rights and environmental due diligence for large companies is 0.009% of revenues, EU member states are continuing to pursue a deregulatory agenda. Ireland’s Presidency should aim to: Protect the core integrity of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), including obligations beyond first-tier suppliers, meaningful transition plans, strong civil liability provisions and the role of affected communities. Ensure the financial sector is brought within the scope of due-diligence and reporting frameworks, given its large global footprint and the impact of unregulated capital flows on the world’s climate. Promote an evidence-based, balanced discussion on competitiveness that focuses on economic resilience while staying committed to the EU’s stated values related to human rights."

We adopt a human rights approach to development and working towards sustainable, long-term change to address the root causes of poverty and injustice more effectively.",Global - our submission will focus predominately on the EU’s external action with a focus on its role in the Global South.,3,"One of the clearest ways Ireland can make a meaningful impact during its Presidency is by placing women’s rights at the centre of the Council’s work and promoting the work of women’s rights organisations. The global context highlights why a focus on women’s rights is crucial right now. Across every region, we are witnessing a rapid erosion of rights: coordinated “anti-gender” movements, democratic backsliding, escalating conflicts, and unprecedented cuts to ODA. These forces are converging to undermine decades of progress for women and girls. Women’s rights organisations have always been underfunded — now they are being pushed beyond breaking point. According to AWID, women’s rights organisations receive only 0.13% of the total Official Development Assistance (ODA) and only 0.4% of all gender related aid. The gutting of ODA is now amplifying this. UN Women’s latest survey of more than 400 women’s rights organisations across humanitarian settings puts this in stark terms: nine in ten have already lost funding, nearly three-quarters have had to cut staff, and almost half expect to close imminently if cuts continue. The first programmes to go when ODA is cut are those most essential to women’s rights — GBV services, sexual and reproductive health, and protection. Despite some progress worldwide on gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment, none of the indicators and sub-indicators of Sustainable Development Goal 5—the goal for gender equality—has been met. At current rates, gender parity in parliaments remains a distant dream, potentially not achievable until 2063. Overall, 24.3 million more females live in extreme poverty compared to males. By 2030, a projected 8.1 per cent of females (compared to 7.6 per cent of males) will linger in extreme poverty, missing the SDG target. Ending extreme poverty for women and girls will take an additional 137 years if this trend continues. And about 1 in 4 girls continue to be married as children. Discriminatory legal frameworks prevail in many parts of the world. In 18% of countries, women do not have equal rights to confer citizenship to their spouses and their children. By 2050, climate change may push up to 158 million more women and girls into extreme poverty ($2.15 per day), 16 million more than men and boys. This is precisely why an Irish Presidency centred on women’s rights would have the most transformational impact. When women’s rights organisations are supported, the effects cascade across communities and countries. Their work reduces violence, strengthens community resilience, expands civic space, and drives legal and policy reforms that benefit entire societies. Research consistently shows that feminist movements have been the strongest driver of laws to end violence against women — more influential than political parties, economic growth or international interventions. Being steadfast in support for women’s rights is one of the surest ways to strengthen democracy, prevent conflict, and build resilience to impacts of humanitarian crises. It is also consistent with what Ireland has already signalled in its campaign for the UN Human Rights Council seat for 2027–2029."

The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) 2025 report highlights a worrying drift in parts of the EU away from the values it is built on. If the EU steps back from its commitments to human rights, non-discrimination and the rule of law, it is not only the EU that is weakened — it will become harder for Ireland to explain why these institutions matter. Recent shifts in migration policy is a clear example. The Council’s position on the Return Regulation shaped in part by the rise of the far-right across Europe, is out of step with the views of Irish. ESRI research shows broad public support in Ireland for migrants and refugees and a strong preference for humane and principled policies. When EU decisions move away from that, it creates a disconnect between EU values and the values Irish people hold. By defending the values the founding principles of the EU, principles and values that Irish people hold, this will increase ownership and alignment around shared and principled values. The public are supportive of Ireland standing up for human rights, for global justice, and for development cooperation that reaches the people who need it most. Civil society can play a critical role here, not only in helping the Presidency tell these stories but in supporting Ireland to develop positions through meaningful engagement before and during the Presidency. Structured dialogue with civil society in Ireland, alongside engagement through Ireland’s embassy networks, would help ensure EU priorities are shaped by real experiences, reinforce public trust, and demonstrate that the Presidency is something citizens can see themselves reflected in."

At a moment like this, Ireland’s history of peacebuilding and neutrality gives us a credible role to push for a stronger focus on peacebuilding, diplomacy and conflict prevention. In March of 2025 Ursula von der Leyen introduced a new €800 billion package to increase military spending within the EU—an effort comparable to the €806 billion allocated for post-COVID recovery. Within this focus, not enough attention is paid to an EU long-term peace and development strategy that prioritise conflict resolution, prevention, mediation and peacebuilding. States have an obligation to protect their citizens, and the reality is Europe is facing new threats. However, higher military budgets have not proven to be the best approach to ensuring lasting peace. Instead, they risk escalating tensions, prompting other nations to increase their own military spending. This can lead to an arms race and a greater likelihood of military interventions, potentially worsening conflicts rather than preventing them. The projected levels of investment (EU 2%) bring us back to the 1990s level of spending. Investing in conflict prevention on the other hand saves lives, with potential savings between US$698 million and $1.5 billion per year. There is little evidence available to suggest that building military-security capabilities leads to reform, and improved peace, justice and development outcomes. Take the example of Afghanistan, evidence shows how military spending did not lead to security in the region. Despite 16 states supplying the country with weapons and equipment for nearly two decades and the US spending 83 billion USD on training and arming Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), chaos and fear engulfed Afghanistan as the Taliban swiftly defeated the ANDSF in the wake of the US withdrawal in 2021. This example illustrates how little military spending and militarisation of a society have to do with peace, safety, and stability, and how, in fact, military spending undermines these. Military expenditure has a huge impact on and plays a role in the climate crises, which constitute a major threat to peace and security In 2019, it was reported that the US military, the world’s largest industrial military, was the single biggest polluter in the world. Militarization can facilitate GBV and sexual violence in conflict, destabilize communities, exacerbate power imbalances, and reinforce already existing patriarchal structures. Excessive prioritization of defense spending diverts resources from education, healthcare, economic development, climate action, and ODA, all of which are fundamental to long-term peace and stability. These sectors are already underfunded globally, and in Europe, climate finance commitments remain insufficient given the scale of the crisis. Given our history of conflict and our commitment to neutrality, Ireland is perfectly placed to use its Presidency to champion Article 26 of the Charter of the United Nations. Which recognizes disarmament as a precondition for durable peace, security and development."

Ireland can seek to reaffirm those values connected to the lived reality of European and global citizens today. It can elevate the values and test all agreements, legislative proposals and agreed EU positions against their adherence to the founding mission of the European Union. It can institute a new reporting mechanism for accountability related to the founding values. Oxfam proposes the following areas as thematic priorities sitting underneath the values umbrella. A: Europe and its role in the world Recent shifts to an EU more focused on self-interest and geoeconomic goals endanger development gains in the global south and risk increasing the debt burden of partner countries. We propose a rebalancing of this agenda back in favour of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and restoring the true spirit of international development cooperation. Oxfam proposes the Irish Presidency focuses on: Ensuring the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is a clear expression of EU values and creating a new complementary strategy to the Global Gateway that prioritises political support and funding towards poverty reduction, fragile states and reaching the furthest behind first. Continuing to lead the EU to take a stronger position to protect the people of Palestine Play a central role in ensuring sufficient humanitarian assistance for those in conflict e.g. in Sudan, Gaza, Ukraine and holding those who perpetrate human rights abuses to account. Focus on Africa Ireland could place particular emphasis on Africa and EU–African Union relations, along the lines of the Spanish Presidency’s focus on Latin America in 2023. With 11 of Ireland’s 14 aid partner countries located in Africa, and given the continent’s disproportionate exposure to conflict, poverty, inequality and climate change, Ireland is well placed to help the EU build a genuine partnership grounded in equality, trust and African leadership. B: A more equal Europe “Inequality has become one of the main concerns for EU citizens” DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG-EMPL). We propose a focus on: EU-wide advances for more progressive taxation to fund public services for all Prioritise the lived experience of European citizens including on affordable housing and decent work, especially for vulnerable groups Prioritise rights and resist deregulation C: A green and digital future A future-proofed, decarbonised economy can be the foundation for a more sustainable future, but only with fairness and human rights at their core. We propose a focus on: Ensuring the EU embeds a just transition in all climate action, including in COP31 so that meeting 2040 climate targets does not disproportionately fall on those who can least afford it. Recognising digital rights as the fulcrum for democracy and regulating the tech industry to protect citizens across Europe and globally."

Ireland should challenge the externalisation of EU border management, oppose opaque migration deals with third countries, and insist that all such agreements and monitoring reports are published and subject to democratic scrutiny. Migration instruments should prioritise safer, cheaper mobility by expanding safe and legal pathways to the EU, reducing reliance on smugglers and traffickers. The EU Pact for the Mediterranean and plans to strengthen Frontex must reflect collective EU responsibility to ensure the Mediterranean is a safe route, not a deadly barrier. A more equal Europe Encourage a stronger Commission role in advancing tax justice, including proposals for EU-level capital gains and wealth taxes, an EU assets registry, and a ban on harmful regimes for individuals such as “golden passports”. Build cross-EU support for a UN Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation to ensure developing countries can participate equally in global tax reform. Ensure the Quality Jobs Act delivers improved working conditions, addresses gender inequality, and guarantees living wages across global supply chains and within the EU. The green transition must create decent, secure jobs, particularly for workers currently in precarious employment or in sectors most affected by decarbonisation. A green and digital future Climate justice Use upcoming reforms of the Circular Economy framework, Energy Union, Climate Action architecture and Climate Resilience framework to position the EU as a global leader at COP31, including by: Targeting emissions linked to excessive consumption Applying polluter-pays and windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies Strengthening corporate sustainability regulation Digital rights Adopt a strong, enforceable Digital Fairness Act that centres people’s rights and safeguards the integrity of the EU’s digital rulebook.

Keeping the Council’s work open and participatory, reinforcing the EU’s values of democracy and the rule of law.

Key priorities include: 1. Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. 2. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: • Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. • Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: • Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. • Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (non legislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. • Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives • Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. • Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. • Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. • Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. • Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness.

Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: • Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. • Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. • Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care.

298,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/19ac1027/The_Shannon_Airport_Group_-_Submission_298.docx,The Shannon Airport Group,,,,1,"Ireland’s presidency of the Council of the European Union offers a valuable opportunity to shape the presidency’s agenda so that it reflects the priorities and challenges of the European Union as a whole, while also considering Ireland’s perspectives. The Shannon Airport Group welcomes the opportunity to provide input to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as it prepares Ireland’s Presidency priorities and policy programme and believe one high level priority should focus on Transport. Transport Strong international transport links have long sustained Ireland’s economy, and this emphasis must guide our Presidency agenda. Transport is not only a national priority for Ireland but a strategic pillar of the European Union’s competitiveness, cohesion, and climate transition. As highlighted in the Draghi Report, “well‑functioning transport networks and services and a prosperous transport industry are crucial to the competitiveness of the entire EU economy”. Efficient transport systems not only ensure access to goods, services, and innovation, but also drive territorial balance and social inclusion across member states. For Ireland, as an island nation reliant on aviation and maritime, the resilience and sustainability of transport infrastructure is inseparable from our competitiveness and our ability to contribute to Europe’s collective prosperity. At EU level, transport is recognised as a service of general interest and a priority sector for the transition to a net‑zero economy. With demand for passenger and freight mobility projected to grow sharply by 2050, and with emissions from transport still higher than in 1990, Ireland’s presidency of the Council of the EU in 2026 offers a critical opportunity to champion investment in resilient, sustainable transport that strengthens both Ireland’s connectivity and the EU’s collective prosperity. As an island nation, Ireland’s presidency of the EU council should strongly advocate for transport investment in island nations and those at Europe’s periphery. Transport policy at a European level must explicitly recognise the catalytic role of airports and ports in island and peripheral economies. Uniform EU-wide frameworks risk overlooking structural asymmetries, such as geographic isolation, that constrain the capacity of peripheral member states to benefit equally from transport integration. Addressing these imbalances requires differentiated policy design and funding criteria that account for national geography, spatial location within the Union. Funding Investment in Transport Ireland’s 2026 Presidency is strategically timed to influence the next EU budget (MFF 2028–2034). By chairing negotiations, hosting summits, and representing the Council, Ireland will play a pivotal role in shaping Europe’s financial priorities for the next decade. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) 2028– 2034 prioritises transport and energy pillars alongside military mobility, with its financial envelope proposed to increase to €81.4 billion from €33.72 billion in the 2021–2027 period. The oversubscription of CEF calls in 2021–2027, with projects averaging three to four times the available budget, underscores the scale of demand for investment. Ireland should stand firmly behind the ambition to expand the CEF and resist any downward revision to funding during interinstitutional negotiations. Moreover, consideration should be given to how EU funds can better serve Island and peripheral regions of Europe."

This strategy has the potential to be a cornerstone of Europe’s aviation future, setting the direction of EU research and innovation funding while advancing the twin imperatives of decarbonisation and digitalisation, alongside safeguarding competitiveness. Industry stakeholders have called for a significant increase in EU funding for civil aviation research in the next long-term budget to ensure Europe remains at the forefront of global aviation innovation. From an Irish perspective, expanded funding offers opportunities to expand research funding for universities and aviation firms, to leverage Ireland’s renewable energy strengths, to scale digital air traffic management innovations already pioneered by the Irish Aviation Authority and to advance cybersecurity investment under NIS2. By championing these priorities, the Irish Presidency can help ensure that Ireland not only contributes to Europe’s aviation transformation but secure Ireland’s position as a global leader in the sector. The decarbonisation of the aviation sector remains a key challenge. Currently, limited availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across Europe, coupled with insufficient incentives for its production and adoption, is hindering progress on decarbonisation even as EU requirements continue to expand. In an Irish context, the Shannon Estuary has been identified as Ireland’s leading site for Atlantic offshore wind, creating a major opportunity to produce green hydrogen and SAF. Producing SAF within the estuary creates an opportunity to decarbonise the aviation sector here, which will be vital to Ireland as an island nation critically reliant upon air connectivity. The production of SAF also provides a mechanism to sustainably store excess green hydrogen from the estuary and opens the opportunity for Ireland to become a net energy exporter. The Irish Presidency of the EU Council provides an opportunity to further support the development of SAF both at a European and National level and position Ireland as a hub for SAF research and deployment. Ten T The Draghi Report highlights, the potential of the EU’s transport sector has not yet been fully leveraged, noting that completion of TEN‑T is projected to bring an annual GDP increase of €467 billion by 2050, requiring an estimated €845 billion in investment by 2040, including €210 billion for cross‑border links. The completion of the core network by 2030 and the extended core by 2040 will deliver an interconnected, interoperable, smart, safe, sustainable, resilient, and multimodal European transport system, strengthening competitiveness and cohesion across the Union. Strengthening the integration of peripheral regions into the core Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) is not only a matter of national interest but also a broader European imperative for competitiveness, cohesion, and resilience. Supporting the timely completion of the Trans‑European Transport Network (TEN‑T) must be a central priority during Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2026."

Today, one of the greatest threats to European values is the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, which places significant pressure on the Cultural and Creative Sectors (CCSs). The Irish Presidency has the unique opportunity to demonstrate that the CCSs lie at the heart of the digital era and AI development, as an EU that neglects culture is an EU that compromises its fundamental values. By promoting a digital environment that is fair and supportive of European creativity, the Presidency can ensure that rightsholders are protected and that the EU copyright framework is fully respected and enforced, safeguarding the very foundation of Europe’s cultural and innovative strength.

In the course of the assessment of the DSM Directive, clarification is needed with regard to the applicability of Art. 3 and 4 to AI training. While the Juri report from the European Parliament emphasises that the rules on Text and Data Mining (TDM) were never meant to cover AI training, it became obvious that such interpretation would seriously be in conflict with the EU Copyright Framework. It must be made clear that neither Art. 3 nor Art. 4 cover the (entire) process of AI training and that any use of protected works for AI training would need a license from the authors. Further, Art. 4 DSM Directive is the first ever limitation for commercial purposes and bears a very high risk of being in conflict with the three-step test. It is therefore necessary to specify that TDM following Art. 4 DSM directive may not be used for commercial AI uses. Beyond the AI Act and its implementing Code of Practice, further legislation is needed to ensure fair remuneration of authors in the fast-evolving technical environment. Technical solutions have not solved the problems of digital mass uses of works – but bear the high risk of being outdated before they can be implemented. The European legislators should rather rely on the abstract principles of copyright which proved fit to adapt to the immense technical changes of the last 100 years. Clearing rights for the use of a very high number of works can be achieved with CMOs, offering simple licenses to mass users. Yet, European rightsholders would also need the support of the national and pan European institutions to defend their rights. For example, anti-trust remedies might be taken into consideration in cases where a user tries to evade licenses offered to him or in cases where unlicensed use of works results in content which is re-commercialised in Europe. These legislations have the potential to significantly impact the lives of European visual artists, making it essential to consider their effects while large technological companies continue to generate massive profits at the expense of creators. The Irish Presidency should also engage closely with stakeholders, paying careful attention to the needs and challenges of the CCSs. By doing so, it can demonstrate that European institutions are capable of driving positive change, contributing to a thriving society, and promoting innovation while consistently upholding the values of cultural diversity and democracy."

This is also recognised by Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, Youth, Culture and Sport Glenn Micallef, who, through the “Culture Compass” initiative, has put forward an EU Artists’ Charter aimed at empowering artists and cultural professionals. Authors can create only if they receive a fair remuneration, and every source of income plays a critical role. It is therefore crucial to preserve and reinforce remuneration rights (such as Public Lending Right, private copy, resale right, reprography and so on) especially as these are increasingly challenged by counter-lobbying efforts that do not consider how essential these rights are to artists’ livelihoods. Where such remuneration is due for uses made for cultural and educational purposes, the beneficiaries must be sustainably funded and be able to pay fair and adequate remuneration to the authors. For these reasons, it is also important that limitations and exceptions to copyright are not further expanded, including in the digital environment, as this would also undermine authors’ income opportunities, whereas the existing framework already cover essential areas such as education."

Like 5G infrastructure and submarine cables, data infrastructure intersects with matters of national economic security, particularly as it pertains to critical or sensitive sectors such as many public services, financial services, healthcare, revenue collection, law enforcement and education. However, we have observed an inconsistent approach from Member State to Member State in ensuring that Europe’s data is stored in secure locations with secure and trustworthy providers. To that end, we would encourage the Irish Presidency to work towards a common position on the use of ‘trusted vendor’ criteria to ensure that both public and private sector organisations are partnering with reliable ICT and data infrastructure partners. Ensuring Procurement Supports EU Objectives – Procuring authorities have, far too often, been focused on price, selecting the lowest bid regardless of the track record of the supplier in question, or the potential risks they pose, ultimately undermining the resilience and security of key sectors of the economy. Broadly, we recommend the Irish Presidency encourage further discussion on how public authorities move away from using price as the sole criteria for procurement, towards a position where quality, consisting of factors like price, safety, sustainability, and resilience, become the norm. Building Europe’s Data Infrastructure – Scaling Europe’s capabilities in cloud and artificial intelligence will be a core goal of the upcoming CAIDA. The ability to scale these industries will be key to Europe’s global competitiveness and attractiveness in the coming decades. We would, therefore, encourage the Irish Presidency to promote discussion on how Europe’s data infrastructure can be developed in a secure and sustainable manner, whilst ensuring access to best-in-class technologies."

Securing the ICT Supply Chain Both the publication of the ICT Supply Chain Toolbox, and the revision of the EU Cybersecurity Act (‘CSA’) will be excellent opportunities for Member States to reinforce trust and security in the ICT Supply Chain. The Irish Presidency can deliver a pragmatic agenda when it comes to cybersecurity, focusing on: Prioritizing supply chain security in data infrastructure – foster dialogue on a consistent approach to the implementation of the ICT Supply Chain Toolbox at national level, protecting valuable data from backdoor vulnerabilities and cyberattacks whilst ensuring continued access to leading technologies. Delivering a workable approach to cyber certification – in the context of the CSA, work towards a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework (ECCF) that facilitates the rapid adoption of certification schemes that deliver functional outcomes for cybersecurity assurance and minimize the risk of political stalemate. Ensuring Procurement Supports EU Objectives A proposal to revise the Public Procurement Directives is expected Q2 2026, while initiatives like the Cloud and AI Development Act (‘CAIDA’) and Review of the CSA, may also impact the way cloud and data storage solutions are procured. In that regard, we urge the Irish Presidency to prioritize the discussion of several issues: Advancing functional, quality-driven procurement practices – ensure procuring authorities focus on the best possible quality supply when it comes to procurement, considering a wide range of factors including price, safety, sustainability, and resilience. Developing a harmonized approach to ‘trusted vendor’ – work with Member States, in the context of these initiatives, to form a consistent view on what constitutes a ‘trusted vendor’, reflecting organizations’ governance, risk management and transparency practices. This definition should then be applied horizontally across relevant initiatives to ensure consistency in procurement practices between Member State authorities. Indeed, we consider that the horizontal application of ‘trusted vendor’ criteria will be fundamental to reinforcing the trust dimension of Europe’s approach to sovereignty and European preference, central to the current technology policy agenda. Developing the concept of ‘European preference’ – advance the discussion on how the definition of ‘European preference’ can be operationalized to deliver on the objectives of strategic autonomy and competitiveness, while providing European businesses with the best chance to succeed globally by ensuring access to cutting-edge technology. Building Europe’s Data Infrastructure CAIDA should ensure that Europe remains an attractive place for investment in data infrastructure, and that it is open to trustworthy international partners to contribute. We would urge the Irish Presidency to prioritize: Developing a workable definition of ‘sovereign cloud’ – developing such a definition should be a high priority so providers can augment their existing partnerships as soon as possible to deliver compliant solutions to the market. • Continuing to attract third-country investment – foster a discussion on the creation of frameworks that allow non-EU firms to continue to participate in the European cloud and AI markets when they meet ‘sovereignty-aligned’ criteria (e.g., data residency, transparency, etc.)."

Choosing a ‘trusted vendor’ is key to achieving both. It ensures that organizations can take full advantage of their data, benefit fully from new technologies like AI, advance their competitiveness, and navigate an ever-expanding cyber risk landscape. The security, sustainability and flexibility of data infrastructure is fundamental as the EU looks to move ahead with the digital transition, protect its security interests and boost its competitiveness in key industrial ecosystems. Thus, Europe needs to ensure that it has access to cutting-edge technologies from trusted providers and does not leave its data vulnerable to backdoor attacks or cyberthreats from hostile actors. An agenda that prioritizes these issues benefits both business and citizens to the extent that it takes steps towards ensuring their data is protected and secure.

Youth Empowerment & Inclusion: Make youth unemployment and participation central themes; defend dedicated youth funding. Just Transition & Sustainability: Champion climate action and SDGs under a Presidency theme such as “Delivering the SDGs: A Sustainable Europe for Future Generations.” Democratic Participation: Strengthen civic space and counter disinformation to protect EU values. Addressing Youth Unemployment as a Strategic Objective for Social Europe As Ireland prepares to assume the EU Presidency, tackling youth unemployment must stand as a central pillar of our broader theme on Social Europe. CSO figures reveal a troubling rise in youth unemployment. Particularly alarming is the surge among 15–19-year-olds, signalling growing vulnerability among those with limited educational attainment and minimal labour market experience. Across Europe, young people face increasingly complex transitions from education to employment, exacerbated by technological disruption, automation, and precarious work. Without decisive action, these dynamics risk deepening intergenerational inequality. The revitalisation of the Youth Guarantee, focussing on the European Youth Forum’s Position Paper on Youth Guarantee: How to support young people finding a pathway, must be a cornerstone of EU social policy. Youth work has a critical role to play in this strategy. Operating in informal, out-of-school settings, youth work services engage directly with those furthest from the labour market, including NEETs. By providing outreach, mentoring, and bridging programmes focused on skill development and job readiness, youth work complements formal education and activation measures. Its capacity to build confidence, foster resilience, and develop transferable skills makes it an indispensable resource for employability. To maximise impact, we must uphold quality standards in youth work, ensuring consistency, accountability, and measurable outcomes across Member States. Investing in professional development and evidence-based practice will strengthen youth. Tackling mis and disinformation False information is eroding trust in institutions, fuelling hate speech, and disproportionately impacting young people, who are increasingly exposed to misleading narratives across social media and AI-generated content. Focus groups and studies show that misinformation not only overwhelms and fatigues youth, but also disengages them from civic life, while extremist networks exploit disinformation to recruit and radicalise. Addressing this challenge at the EU level is essential to safeguard democratic processes, protect vulnerable communities, and build resilience among citizens against the evolving threats of false information. Investing in Youth Work, Intercultural and Global Citizenship Educators to help address this issue will be important in tackling mis and disinformation at personal, local, national, and European levels and in turn, should work to reduce negative narratives against people of colour in Europe and across the world."

Housing and Cost of Living Ireland should lead on EU-level measures to address housing affordability and social cohesion. Housing insecurity is a major barrier to youth wellbeing, as highlighted in the Youth Forum’s Youth Progress Index. The Presidency should work to remove EU regulatory obstacles that limit investment in social and affordable housing and advance initiatives such as the Affordable Housing Plan and a Council Recommendation on Ending Homelessness. The aim is to ensure adequate housing supply, protect vulnerable groups, and embed housing within the European Pillar of Social Rights. 2. Reform of the EU Electoral Act The Presidency should prioritise provisions that can achieve consensus, particularly standardising the voting age for European elections at 16 (Article 23 of the 2022 proposed text). Ireland should advocate a targeted approach—advancing select articles rather than the entire package—to strengthen youth participation and address persistently low voter turnout among young people. 3. Erasmus+ and Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) Ireland should secure a strong, well-funded youth chapter in Erasmus+, with earmarked structural and project-based funding for youth organisations. This is essential to safeguard civic space and democratic participation. The Presidency should also promote measures to support youth information services, linked to digital regulation and combating misinformation, deepfakes, and AI-driven threats. It should also support greater cooperation between European member states and countries in the Global South including EU-AU partnerships. Objectives include sustainable funding, stronger social media accountability, and access to regulatory mechanisms to protect young people and civil society. 4. Climate and SDGs Ireland should place education at the core of its approach to climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a strong focus on Global Citizenship Education and Education for Sustainable Development. Ireland should champion the SDGs as a central theme, ensuring they guide policy and practice. Ireland must also provide strong leadership within the EU at COP31, advancing ambitious and inclusive climate commitments. A fair and compassionate approach to debt is also essential, recognising the disproportionate burdens faced by many countries. Finally, Ireland should work to establish tax equity between the Global South and Global North. For peace to take root, compromises must be made, and the interdependence of North and South, as well as rural and urban communities, must be acknowledged and respected."

Businesses: Promote investment in job-intensive sectors (renewable energy, health, education) and fair labour standards. Communities: Strengthen social infrastructure, housing, childcare, and support social economy initiatives. The Irish Presidency can make the most substantial positive impact by making the work and role of the Council more visible and understandable to citizens, thereby strengthening trust in EU institutions. A key opportunity lies in addressing some of the more challenging recommendations from the Conference on the Future of Europe, including those linked to youth participation such as the 25% Project. Demonstrating progress on these proposals would show a genuine commitment to democratic renewal. Ireland’s strong track record in deliberative and participatory democracy, for example through citizens’assemblies, positions it to lead by example. The Presidency should integrate these principles into its approach, ensuring inclusive dialogue and transparency in decision-making. This could include referencing youth-driven recommendations from the EU Youth Dialogue consultations and embedding them in Council priorities."

Micro-grant schemes that empower local youth-led initiatives and ambitious, inclusive events can make EU values tangible. For example, the ‘All Abroad’ train event with Léargas demonstrated how creative experiences can connect young people to Europe in a meaningful way. Similarly, initiatives like Oíche na hÓige (Youth Night), where youth clubs and services across Ireland opened their doors to the community, showcased the impact of youth work and fostered dialogue between young people and the wider public. Replicating and scaling such events during the Presidency would highlight EU principles of diversity, equality, and inclusion while making them visible at local level. These efforts should be complemented by strong communication campaigns, social media engagement, and partnerships with schools and community organisations to ensure that citizens not only understand the benefits of EU membership but feel actively involved in shaping Ireland’s role in Europe."

Their recommendations emphasise empowering youth as active European citizens through education, participation, and representation. Education for Active Citizenship Young people want the EU Presidency to champion reforms in education systems across member states. They call for curricula that address emerging challenges such as AI, misinformation, and propaganda, while fostering critical thinking and civic engagement. Education should be adaptive, thought-provoking, and equip youth with skills to navigate digital realities and participate meaningfully in democratic life. Inclusive Participation and Representation Participants stressed the need for accessible, meaningful spaces for youth engagement at local, national, and EU levels. They advocate for youth representation in decision-making structures and partnerships with elected representatives, ensuring diverse voices, urban and rural, are heard and valued. Support and Capacity Building The Presidency should promote initiatives that strengthen youth capacities and networks, such as Erasmus+ and Youth, Peace and Security consultations. These programmes enable cross-border learning, skill development, and active involvement in European affairs. Part 2: Synopsis of Community and Voluntary Pillar Proposals for Ireland Presidency of the EU The Community and Voluntary (CV) Pillar, of which NYCI is a member, urges Ireland to use its EU Presidency to renew the vision of a Social Europe, placing equality, solidarity, and human rights at the heart of EU policymaking. Against a backdrop of geopolitical instability, climate challenges, and rising inequality, the CV Pillar emphasises that economic growth must not overshadow social development. Three Core Themes for the Presidency: Strengthening Social Europe Make the European Pillar of Social Rights enforceable and integrate social objectives into EU economic governance. Advance an EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, including measures for child poverty, NEETs, housing, and homelessness. Promote an EU framework directive on adequate minimum income and ensure access to childcare, education, and healthcare. Safeguard cohesion funding in the Multiannual Financial Framework (2028–2034) and prioritise social investment. Enhancing Democracy & Civil Society Protect civic space and adopt Council Conclusions on civil society engagement. Secure sustainable EU funding for CSOs and promote inclusive governance. Counter disinformation and support initiatives like the EU Civil Society Strategy and Democracy Shield. Just Transition & Sustainability Champion the SDGs as a Presidency theme Protect Green Deal instruments and expand EU budget lines for climate action and biodiversity. Part 3: Synopsis of the Irish Development Education Association Proposals for Ireland Presidency of the EU Ireland should advocate for: A real global perspective in the Multi-Financial Framework proposal. In the current proposal, citizenship education is narrowly framed around EU values, overlooking global challenges like climate change, inequality, peace, and human rights. Reintegrating a global dimension is essential to equip young people with the skills, solidarity, and critical perspective needed to be responsible and active citizens. Development Education and Awareness Raising (DEAR) to remain a separate funding stream. It is in the EU's best interests that citizen engagement and global solidarity remain at the heart of the EU's global partnerships.

This includes human rights protections, the rule of law, free and fair elections, as well as protection of civic space for dialogue and defense of NGOs. When the rule of law and democracy are under attack from internal and external threats, civil society organisations act as watchdogs, promoting transparency and good governance, while also enabling people, including from disadvantaged groups, to participate in decision-making at local, national, and EU level. These organisations are indispensable to a healthy democratic ecosystem and must be recognised as such by public authorities. The general need for a high level of partnership and dialogue between Government and civil society organisations in a healthy democracy should be highlighted during the Presidency. Strengthening the connection of Irish citizens to the EU could be achieved through the organisation of events during the Presidency taking place all across Ireland. Renewed vision of a social Europe Ireland has a long and positive history of progressing a social agenda in the EU, and the Presidency provides an opportunity to shape and drive an agenda focused on a renewal of social cohesion and societal wellbeing. There are significant risks for the EU and its Member States in overly focusing on economic growth over social development, including reduced trust among individuals, institutions and the state, greater fragmentation, and erosion of the social contract. We recommend an increased focus on wellbeing measurement at EU level, as well as social dialogue and civic participation. Ireland should seek to play a key role in the finalisation of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) to preserve the financial sustainability of a social and democratic Europe, as well as a renewed focus on the implementation of the Social Economy Action Plan. 3. Renewed emphasis on a just transition Ireland’s Presidency offers a unique opportunity to press for the protection and expansion of EU budget lines dedicated to the Just Transition, climate action and biodiversity, to champion the SDGs as an overarching framework for European policymaking. It is also vital that Ireland seek to counter the European Commission’s current ‘omnibus simplification’ process and deregulatory agenda, which poses risks to flagship Green Deal instruments, including the LIFE programme and environmental and social elements of the CAP."

The presidency provides an opportunity for Ireland to communicate the democratic values of the European project to its citizens as well as promoting Irish examples of these values across Europe. However, trust goes both ways and the high-level priorities chosen by the Irish government should reflect the needs and priorities of citizens and demonstrate the relevance of EU policy in people’s lives. The actions of the EU on the international stage and in major global conflicts also has a significant impact on trust and perception in its institutions. The Presidency provides an opportunity to set the tone in Europe and to speak out on issues that really matter, as well as working to influence policy and legislation that will have a tangible effect at national level across Europe. At an event gathering together more than 100 of The Wheel’s members, we heard from a broad range of organisations about their priorities and hopes. These included issues such as housing, progressing rights for people seeking international protection, the European Council’s recommendation on homelessness, promotion of social enterprise, reversing the deregulation of climate protections and improving interactions between civil society organisations and the EU more generally. Active citizenship Ireland ranks low in citizen engagement with EU policy and institutions, and civil society uptake of European funding is also low. We recommend that government develop a programme of active citizenship and engagement around the Presidency. This should include meangingful opportunities for a broad cross-section of society, especially young people and communities with the least access to power. Moreover, it will be crucial for events to be organisation all across Ireland, in both rural and urban areas, to engage all citizens and ensure that the Presidency can benefit everyone."
242,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b24116d5/The_Wheel_-_Submission_242.docx,The Wheel,,,,4,"Civil society and EU values Government has already acknowledged the central role that civil society can play in communicating EU values to citizens across Ireland. These organisations are embedded in every community in Ireland, and represent those who are furthest from political institutions. EU policy, in particular, can seem remote and irrelevant to many. In order to improve engagement around the presidency, Government should promote an accessible Europe that can be experienced at local level in both rural and urban areas. It is vital that Government engage with key stakeholders to ensure that groups at risk of poverty and social exclusion, and unemployed people, can influence policy direction and implementation, and that their experiences become part of the dialogue with European institutions to try and repair social cohesion and political legitimacy. It is essential, therefore, that the high-level priorities chosen by Government are meaningful to people across society and do not relate solely to economic growth. Funding for civil society In order to achieve this, civil society needs support and funding. We recommend that: CERV, under the new AgoraEU programme, should be protected and expanded in the next MFF to respond to rising threats to our sector, including the rise of populism, hate, attacks on civic freedoms and the unprecedented rise of misinformation, which disproportionately affects our sector. The Presidency provides an opportunity for Ireland to recommend the establishment of a match funding facility at member-state level to support civil society participation in EU funding programmes with low cofinancing rates such as the Interregs. This would support the Quadruple Helix model of the academic, private, public and civil society sectors all working together to solve problems. Without meaningful support for civil society groups to participate, this model cannot work. Stronger controls are needed for EU funding managed at national level to ensure that a reasonable portion of funding is ringfenced for civil society. Consultation and co-design processes of nationally-managed EU funding programmes should be meaningful and not just tokenistic or an afterthought. Applications and reporting requirements should be streamlined, so that smaller social economy and civil society organisations have a fair chance to access funding. Funding should be adjusted to acknowledge rising costs across the EU in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In countries with higher costs of living, EU funding is becoming increasingly unsustainable."

This dependence poses significant risks for food security, market stability and sustainability, particularly in the context of increasing global trade disruptions, geopolitical instability, and environmental challenges in major exporting regions. A resilient and secure European food system requires a holistic protein strategy that reduces reliance on imports while strengthening domestic and regional production capacities. Enhancing European soya production Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise policies and initiatives aimed at boosting sustainable European soya cultivation. Increasing production within the continent not only enhances protein self-sufficiency but also supports farmers in diversifying crop rotations, improving soil health, and contributing to climate and biodiversity objectives. Integrating Ukraine as a key player in the European protein system Ukraine is by far the largest soya-producing country in Europe and therefore essential for a truly integrated European protein market. The Presidency should promote closer market integration between EU and Ukrainian soya sectors, facilitating trade, investment, and sustainability alignment. This would strengthen the resilience of Europe’s feed and food supply chains, support Ukraine’s economic recovery, and advance the EU’s geopolitical and sustainability goals simultaneously."

Such a strategy should: Encourage investment in European legume cultivation Support research and innovation on plant breeding, agronomy, and climate adaptation Improve the market framework for sustainable European protein crops Foster cooperation between EU Member States and neighbouring producers Livestock Strategy Ireland should use its mandate to reach a common position with the Commission and the Council ensuring that the livestock strategy also covers the topic of European and regional animal feed. The livestock strategy is directly linked to the broader European protein strategy. Strengthening European feed production – particularly of sustainable soya and other protein crops – will increase resilience, reduce import dependency and improve the environmental performance of livestock farming. When the topic of livestock is approached holistically, the EU can support food security, sustainability and competitiveness in the livestock sector. EU Plant-Based Action Plan Building on successful examples such as Denmark’s Plant-Based Action Plan, the EU should adopt a Plant-Based Strategy that complements the Protein Strategy and supports dietary transition, innovation, and market development.

It provides a holistic framework for a “Protein Transition” based on five interconnected pillars that address both the supply and demand sides of Europe’s protein challenge: Sustainable and responsible imports: Imports to Europe should be on a level playing field with EU production to ensure high environmental and social standards contributing to global sustainability and deforestation-free supply chains while supporting competitiveness of EU farmers. Increased production of legumes in Europe: Expanding the cultivation of legumes such as soya, peas, and faba beans would reduce the protein deficit, improve soil health, enhance biodiversity, and strengthen rural economies. Improved use of existing and new protein resources: Better utilisation of by-products (e.g. rapeseed and sunflower meal), forage crops (e.g. alfalfa, clover), and novel sources like algae can diversify and strengthen Europe’s protein base. Increased efficiency of protein use: Matching livestock diets more precisely to their nutritional needs can reduce nitrogen losses, lower feed costs, and cut pollution. Healthier and more sustainable diets: Encouraging a shift towards more plant-based diets and moderate consumption of meat and dairy can reduce environmental impacts, improve public health, and support the overall protein transition Find the complete strategy here: DS_Protein-Strategy-for-Europe-26072018-2.pdf And the Donau Soja Position Paper on expectations for a European protein strategy arising from the EU’s Vision for Agriculture and Food: DS_Position-Paper_03.11.25.pdf"

One example where particular impact could be made is encouraging all nations to embed sustainable education into all higher education courses, as we are currently striving to do with great support from the HEA. We can also further drive the impact of this through lobbying professional accreditation bodies to include emphasis on sustainability in education for their respective fields (some Irish bodies currently do this such as nursing and education)."

We also advocate for policy change at a European level through our membership of Autism Europe.",1,"From AsIAm’s perspective, Ireland’s Presidency of the Council (EU) presents a real opportunity to promote European values by prioritising a people-centred, rights-based approach which advances Autistic people's inclusion, equality and the community’s full and active participation across the EU, as well as Disabled people. We believe that one of the Presidency’s core thematic priorities should focus on advancing the EU’s rights agenda, particularly with regard to growing concerns around the restrictions of democratic values across the Union, with a particular focus on ensuring Autistic people across the European Union have equal access to services and community life. The EU’s commitment to United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and the implementation of the European Disability Strategy, and towards the successor Disability Strategy over the coming years are important mechanisms to achieving this. Ireland must use this presidency as an opportunity to advance and safeguard the rights of Autistic people, by ensuring a pan-European approach to support Autistic people within our respective societies. This aligns with Ireland’s recent progress on disability rights, such as the Autism Innovation Strategy, and reflects the EU Strategic Agenda’s vision for a fair, social and inclusive Europe, and promoting democratic values across the Union. As part of this theme and considering the UNCRPD’s central role within the EU’s Social agenda, the Irish Presidency could highlight the need for coordinated European action on supporting Autistic people and families through the development of a European Autism Strategy, building on the work of the Autism Innovation Strategy in Ireland and the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People, in recognising the specific structural barriers Autistic people face across Member States, and the work that several EU Members have undertaken in developing their own autism strategies. Placing the economic, social and cultural rights of Autistic people at the centre of Ireland’s Presidency strengthens our commitment to advancing these rights, and aligns with the EU’s broader priorities, such as promoting social rights, enhancing workforce participation, strengthening access to education, improving public services, and supporting digital and green transitions, which Ireland plays a vital role in advancing rights and protecting democratic freedoms and the rule of law. Autistic people come from all walks of life and live in every community and village across Ireland and the EU.

We also advocate for policy change at a European level through our membership of Autism Europe.",2,"AsIAm recommends that as part of the the Irish Presidency in the second half of 2026, the Government highlight and advance the following policy areas: Implementation of the European Disability Strategy (EDRS) 2021–2030, and successor Disability Strategy Ireland should prioritise Council discussions that advance tangible progress on key initiatives within the European Disability Strategy, including: The Disability Card and Parking Card Regulation; The framework for disability-inclusive social protection and employment, including harmonising access to social protection and disability supports across the EU so that Disabled people have the same freedom of movement as all EU citizens; The Disability Employment Package; Enlargement of accessibility standards across digital and built environments. Mainstreaming disability policy on key issues, including housing, wellbeing and social inclusion, and access to social and cultural rights. The Presidency should focus on reaching Council milestones that strengthen monitoring, enforcement, and mainstreaming of disability rights across all policy areas, recognising the influence EU social policy has on promoting wellbeing and living standards for Disabled people in Ireland, including Autistic people. Development of a European Autism Strategy There is currently no EU-level coordinated approach to supporting the unique barriers Autistic people experience in our community, despite the visibility of Autistic people increasing from 1-65 to 1 in 22 in Irish society. Many members of the Autistic community experience unique inequalities in accessing key supports and services. These include access to the following; diagnosis and assessment, appropriate educational placements, employment opportunities, access to health and disability services, social inclusion, community life, and independent living, particularly on the issue of deinstitutionalisation, where aspects of EU Social Funds are used within some Member States to keep Autistic people, and people with intellectual disabilities in these institutions. Such approaches are not conducive to advancing the rights of Autistic people in society. The development of a pan-European Autism Strategy would support Autistic people across Europe in accessing support, community life and having the same opportunities as neurotypical people within their respective societies. The Irish Autism Innovation Strategy which is 16 months in operation has made several positive inroads in advancing the position of Autistic people within Irish society. These include specific research studies on Autistic life in Ireland, adaptation of Universal Design Principles, the creation of Community Hub One Stop Shops, greater engagement with policymakers in the design and creation of policy guidance documents, which have a direct impact on the Autistic community. A pan-European approach to supporting Autistic people would assist in the breaking down of the systemic barriers Autistic people experience within our society. Advocating for a European Autism Strategy is an opportunity for Ireland to show leadership in advancing the importance of addressing the unique barriers Autistic people experience across our European societies. A European Autism Strategy would enable: Harmonised standards for early supports, education, and employment for Autistic people; Better data collection and comparability across Member States on Autistic people’s participation in society; Recognition of autism within EU research and funding programmes; Greater knowledge sharing and collaboration among professionals in advancing studies specific to the Autistic community’s needs. Greater protection of Autistic people’s rights, autonomy, and equal participation across the European Union; A shift to neurodiversity-affirming, rights-based policies across the Union, aligning with our UNCRPD obligations and shifting attitudes to supporting Autistic people across the EU. Standardised language on Autism that has a rights-based focus on it. The Irish Presidency could advocate for Council Conclusions mandating the European Commission to explore and outline such a strategy. Strengthening accessibility in digital and public service transformation As the EU implements major digital reforms including the European Accessibility Act and the Digital Services Act, accessibility must be its foundation. Ireland could steer work on ensuring that AI deployment, social media, public digital services, and online platforms are fully accessible and safe for Autistic users."

Focusing on quality policing, with expertise in effective interviewing and enhancing suspect rights could contribute to this in a very concrete manner. The EU should formally support the Méndez Principles and seek to have each state party become compliant with their terms. The Irish Presidency could at least put this on the agenda. Many EU states, for example, do not routinely audio record police interviews – a basic expectation in that context could be required under EU law. That is just one example of how Ireland could lead on this important issue. Even rights which seem well-established are coming under pressure these days and the EU needs to lead on upholding the rule of law, insisting on minimum protections for citizens, and ensuring effective criminal justice processes for all (suspects, victims, witnesses, the wider public, and indeed the police who work within the system)."

There are many issues on which the EU can, should and must show global leadership at a time of instability and fear. My suggestion is that a focus on the rule of law, protection of human rights, and effective police investigations could be an important part of such global leadership. The science behind the Méndez Principles is now clear that coercion, abuse and denial of legal rights in police interviews does not lead to reliable information. The EU could and should do more in leading the call for better and more consistent police training, particularly in relation to investigative interviewing, and redoubling efforts to ensure protections for suspects, victims, and witnesses who are interviewed by the police."

The EU is clear that it wants “simpler rules, stronger delivery” and “a prosperous and competitive Europe”. There has been substantial discussion of reforms, but so far only a limited number of policy changes have actually been implemented. Ireland has a unique opportunity to drive the competitiveness agenda by focusing on the European built environment during its presidency. (The term built environment refers to the physical buildings and infrastructure which underpin economic growth.) A potential slogan for the presidency could be “A Europe that can build – for people, for climate, for competitiveness.” Focusing on this is good for competitiveness because the built environment is a key input to economic growth. Workers need homes. Businesses need factories and premises. Trade requires infrastructure like roads and bridges. Travel requires public transit infrastructure. And electricity users need generators like wind and solar to be built, along with transmission systems to move the electricity to homes and businesses. The construction of these inputs will boost economic growth across the continent. Removing barriers to their construction is essential for competitiveness and the EU’s wider prosperity. Simplification of rules is already at the top of the European agenda, and this theme would help drive that agenda to completion. A strong and competitive EU growth rate is key to any other future goals that the EU has, from enlargement to security to climate."

In addition, housing is a key focus area for the EU in 2026, with proposals expected to be published. The built environment is the key underlying theme here. The Irish government should aim to prioritise these built environment agenda items, making them central to the presidency. They can have an outsized impact on EU growth rates and cohesion. In its public research, Progress Ireland has proposed how environmental directives (Environmental Impact Assessment, Birds and Habitats, and the Aarhus Convention) can be reformed to allow more building without compromising on environmental goals."

This priority advances the European Council’s commitment to “supporting young people, reducing inequalities, and renewing Europe’s social contract,” while aligning closely with the European Commission’s 2026 Work Programme, including tackling child poverty and the cost-of-living crisis, strengthening the Child Guarantee, and promoting intergenerational fairness. A Presidency that foregrounds children and youth would signal Europe’s commitment to building societies where every young person has the opportunity to thrive. Ireland is in a uniquely strong position to lead this agenda. As host of Growing Up in Digital Europe (GUIDE), Europe’s first pan-European, comparative, longitudinal cohort study of children’s wellbeing, Ireland can showcase how high-quality research infrastructures underpin transformative policymaking. GUIDE, coordinated by University College Dublin, holds ESFRI Roadmap status and is advancing toward establishment as a European Research Infrastructure, with Ireland as the legal seat. The GUIDE consortium currently involves 21 Member States and 5 non-EU countries (UK, Norway, Iceland, Ukraine, and Australia). It will generate data that will inform evidence-based policymaking on areas such as children’s wellbeing, family circumstances, education, digital experiences, and health, for decades. This evidence base is urgently needed. Member States face shared challenges: persistent child poverty, widening inequalities, pressures on health and education systems, and rapid technological change shaping young people’s lives. GUIDE will allow the EU to monitor these dynamics over time, evaluate national and EU-level initiatives, and understand how early-life inequalities compound into adulthood. It will support the implementation and monitoring of the EU Child Guarantee, the EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child, and forthcoming initiatives on digital safety, mental health, and social inclusion. Highlighting GUIDE during the Irish Presidency positions Ireland as a European leader shaping the knowledge base for a more just and cohesive future. Priority 2: A Strong, Sustainable and Connected European Research and Innovation System Europe’s ability to thrive in a changing world depends on a research and innovation system that is connected, high-performing, and strategically autonomous. The European Council Strategic Agenda and the Commission’s Work Programme call for reinforcing Europe’s competitiveness and deepening cooperation in research and innovation. Ireland’s Presidency provides a timely opportunity to champion this vision, drawing on its leadership of GUIDE. As an emerging European Research Infrastructure, GUIDE exemplifies the value of coordinated, cross-border research investments that mobilise expertise from universities, national statistical systems, NGOs, policymakers, and international partners. Its development demonstrates how shared methodologies, interoperable data infrastructures, and collaborative governance can advance both scientific excellence and policy impact. GUIDE’s European Commission-funded collaborative work with other social science research infrastructures (SHARE, The Generations and Gender Programme, and the European Social Survey) is in areas such as the green transition, open science and data governance, and innovative pathways for translating research into policy. Strengthening Europe’s knowledge systems underpins competitiveness, digital sovereignty, wellbeing, and Europe’s ability to respond collectively to social, economic, and environmental challenges."

The 2026 Commission Work Programme places renewed emphasis on combating child poverty, improving access to essential services, strengthening the European Child Guarantee and supporting intergenerational fairness. These priorities reflect the EU’s longstanding commitment to ensuring every child has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of background, by guaranteeing access to healthcare, education, childcare, nutrition and housing for children in need. Progress in these areas would have a direct and positive impact on families and communities across the EU. The Irish Presidency should aim to achieve the following: Steer Council discussions to advance files relating to the strengthened Child Guarantee, mental health, education and social inclusion. The Child Guarantee remains a central pillar of EU social policy, aiming to address cycles of disadvantage and social exclusion by ensuring children in need can access essential services. The Presidency can play a key role in bringing Member States closer to political agreement on any Commission proposals or regulatory guidance connected to national action plans, monitoring frameworks and the EU Anti-Poverty Strategy that is developing around the Guarantee. Facilitate evidence-informed debate, reflecting the EU’s long-term need for high-quality, comparable data to monitor childhood inequality and wellbeing. Past Presidencies have shown that events such as informal ministerial meetings and technical roundtables are effective platforms for building consensus, exchanging best practice and elevating evidence-based policymaking. For example, Presidencies have convened expert events alongside formal Council meetings to examine implementation challenges and policy coherence across member states. This approach can help ensure that ongoing efforts to reduce child poverty and improve wellbeing are grounded in robust evidence and systematically monitored, even as data infrastructures continue to develop. Showcase Ireland’s hosting of Growing Up in Digital Europe (GUIDE) as an example of an emerging European Research Infrastructure that will, once operational, support future EU policy evaluation. The Irish Presidency can draw attention to the significant preparatory progress being made on GUIDE, which to date has been funded through successive European Commission grants. This work exemplifies Europe’s investment in building the knowledge needed to inform public policy over the long term. By presenting GUIDE in conferences, workshops and Presidency-branded events on child wellbeing and social policy, Ireland can highlight how collaborative research infrastructures contribute to Europe’s capacity to understand and address complex challenges such as inequality, education trajectories and digital engagement among young people."

Building on these precedents, Ireland can help deliver outcomes that matter across the Union. First, the Presidency can advance key initiatives aimed at improving child wellbeing, tackling poverty and strengthening access to essential services. These areas are central to the 2026 Commission Work Programme, and progress here would directly support families and reinforce social cohesion. By facilitating constructive, evidence-informed discussions on the strengthened Child Guarantee, mental health and social inclusion, Ireland can contribute to long-term improvements in living standards and opportunities for young people. Second, the Presidency can strengthen Europe’s competitiveness by supporting progress on research, innovation and the European Research Area. Past Presidencies, such as Germany’s leadership on Horizon Europe and Slovenia’s focus on research infrastructures, have shown the value of advancing knowledge, innovation and technology policy.

Recent Presidencies have demonstrated the value of consistent, accessible communication, including public briefings and livestreamed events. Ireland could build on this by offering regular public updates, using clear language, and creating digital channels where citizens can follow progress in real time. Recent Presidencies have successfully integrated schools and youth organisations into their programmes through outreach, debates and youth parliaments. Ireland can build ownership among young people by involving schools, universities, and youth groups in Presidency dialogues, particularly on themes such as digital safety, mental health, skills and child wellbeing, which matter directly to younger generations. This approach aligns strongly with the ethos of GUIDE, which has embedded youth participation and child-centred principles since its earliest design stages.

This builds on Ireland’s long-standing experience in running Growing Up in Ireland, our national longitudinal study, which has demonstrated the sustained value of child-centred, high-quality evidence for policymaking. Over the past five years, the project has gained considerable momentum across Europe: GUIDE has now been added to several national research infrastructure roadmaps (including Iceland, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), with further applications under active review. The consortium has also secured funding for pilot studies in a growing number of countries, including the UK, Norway, Denmark, Italy and Slovenia, alongside the European Commission-funded pilots conducted in 2023 in Ireland, France, Croatia and Finland. Ireland’s Trio partners, Lithuania and Greece, are also members of the GUIDE consortium, which provides a helpful continuity of understanding and engagement across the 18-month Trio Presidency period. GUIDE is now entering a critical phase as we move toward establishing the study as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). Achieving this outcome requires visible, sustained commitment from participating Member States. Ireland’s engagement as the host country and legal seat is therefore essential to maintaining the strong European momentum already in place. The timing of Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2026 provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate this leadership. Presidency periods traditionally showcase national contributions that align with wider EU priorities, and GUIDE offers a clear example of Ireland supporting Europe’s long-term capacity for evidence-informed policymaking on children and young people. Visible political support during this period would signal Ireland’s commitment as host, strengthen confidence among Member States considering participation, and help consolidate the foundation needed to advance GUIDE toward ERIC status. We would be pleased to provide further information or brief officials as needed to support the development of the Presidency programme or to clarify the role of GUIDE within the wider European Research Infrastructure landscape."

As global tourism transforms in scale and complexity, Ireland’s Presidency provides a unique opportunity to lead EU tourism with a coherent, sustainable, innovation-driven approach. With the world’s population increasing and transport connectivity improving, more people will be on the move whether to study, to work or to visit. Thus tourism, the ‘activity’ of people taking a trip to a destination outside their usual residence, for less than a year, will become an even more pronounced feature of the European economy in the years ahead. Currently the sector represents 10% of EU GDP and sustains over 22 million jobs. The key choice facing the EU, from a tourism perspective, is whether it will offer innovative leadership and support to Member States for the benefit of its citizens, or continue to respond in an ad hoc, fragmented manner to challenges as they arise. The PwC ‘Stock-taking study of the co-implementation of Transition pathway for Tourism and EU Agenda 2030’ (Oct ’25), highlights the entrenched barriers that impact tourism actors across EU-27 as follows: Governance fragmentation, including low political prioritisation of tourism Access to funding Data limitations Skills shortages The upcoming Ireland-Lithuania-Greece Presidency Trio provides a political opportunity to champion a transformative approach to the implementation of the new EU Sustainable Tourism Strategy due Q2, 2026.

The Commission’s Work Programme 2026 identifies Tourism in Annex 1: New Initiatives1, No 10. A sustainable and resilient EU tourism sector will support all the key aims of this work programme. The EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism has correctly identified the following challenges facing the sector: boosting competitiveness, enhancing climate resilience, ensuring balances tourism, embracing digital innovation and securing a skilled workforce. However, more fundamental tourism challenges remain to be addressed including tourism governance, tourism innovation and tourism financing. In addition to hosting the 25th European Tourism Forum, the Irish Presidency should aim to achieve the following with regard to tourism: Governance Reform - Elevate and prioritise tourism in the work of the Competitiveness Council.

The themes chosen should support Member States to build systems that are equitable, person-centred and prepared for the future, particularly in the context of an ageing population, increasing chronic conditions, and widening health and social inequalities. Dementia is one of the defining public health and societal challenges of our time, affecting millions across the EU and placing increasing pressure on health systems, families, and communities. In May 2025, Member States at the 78th World Health Assembly agreed to extend the Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia by six years in response to the growing challenge of dementia across the world. There are almost eight million people living with dementia in the European Union and prevalence rates are rising sharply with this number expected to double to 14.3 million by 2050. It is estimated that when a person is diagnosed with dementia, three people in their lives are significantly impacted. In Ireland, an estimated 64,000 people live with dementia, supported by over 180,000 family carers. These figures highlight the urgency of embedding dementia within European health and social policy initiatives. As Ireland prepares for its Presidency of the Council of Europe, there is a unique opportunity to frame dementia as both a public health and human rights priority, aligning with the Council’s broader mission of democracy, rule of law, and social inclusion. The EU Presidency framework traditionally emphasises high-level priorities such as strengthening democracy, protecting human rights, and addressing equality. Dementia can be advanced indirectly through public health, equity, inclusion and rights-based approaches ensuring that people living with dementia are recognised as equal citizens entitled to dignity, protection, and inclusion. Healthy Ageing and Protecting Health Systems: Ireland should champion an EU focus on promoting health across the life course, with emphasis on prevention, population health equity, and supporting sustainability and preparedness of health systems. Human Rights, Inclusion and Participation: Ireland should prioritise a Europe where people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities can live with dignity, independence and autonomy, in line with the UNCRPD. Research, Innovation, Data and Ethics: As the pace of health research, digital tools, assistive technologies and therapeutic interventions accelerate, the EU Presidency should adopt evidence-based, ethical and person-centred approaches to these matters. Community, Care and Social Solidarity: Ireland has a vibrant community-culture and should highlight the role and value of strong communities, inclusive services, and cross-sector collaboration in supporting wellbeing across the lifespan. Although the Council of Europe Presidency does not define dementia-specific priorities, advocacy groups and policy frameworks across Europe, under the umbrella of Alzheimer Europe, have already identified dementia as a pressing issue. Key priorities include raising awareness of dementia as a societal challenge, improving care, supporting carers and families with social and financial measures, promoting research and ensuring human rights protections for people living with dementia."

There remains significant variation in access, quality, and rights-based implementation of long-term care. The Presidency should aim to: Promote meaningful indicators and shared monitoring mechanisms for community-based care, quality standards, carer supports, and equitable access. Facilitate peer learning and structured exchange on workforce development, integrated care models, and sustainable funding. Promote rights-based, person-centred care that supports autonomy and dignity Advancing the EU Disability Rights Strategy and Related Legal Reform: Ensuring full implementation of the UNCRPD requires further concrete policy progress at EU level.

Support ongoing work on legal capacity, supported decision-making, and non-discrimination frameworks. • Promote legislative and policy action that ensures equal participation for people with age-related or cognitive disabilities, and protection from exclusion, stigma, or rights violations. Strengthening Prevention and Population Health Approaches to Ageing: Ireland should support EU cooperation on prevention, healthy ageing and public awareness, aligned with ongoing noncommunicable disease frameworks. The Presidency should aim to: Progress a European Initiative on brain health building on existing work with non-communicable diseases (e.g. Stroke Action Plan for Europe) to support equitable and high-quality standards, promote risk reduction and life course approaches and improve quality of care. Encourage Member States to integrate ageing and brain health into public health campaigns and planning, in addition to promoting EU-wide campaigns. Support coordinated EU action on health inequalities, ensuring access regardless of geography, socioeconomic status, disability, or age. Supporting Fair and Ethical Use of Digital Health and New Innovations: As new digital tools, diagnostics, and treatment options emerge, it is important that all Member States can benefit from them in an ethical, equitable and coordinated way. The Presidency should aim to: Support the roll-out of the European Health Data Space (EHDS). Strengthen cooperation under the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Regulation so that decisions on new technologies and treatments are transparent, consistent and fair across the EU. Promote EU support for health system readiness, including staff training, shared guidance and investment in infrastructure, so new tools and innovations can be introduced safely, ethically and effectively.

The Presidency should aim to: Support the implementation of the European Care Strategy by promoting high-quality, accessible and community-based care options that reflect people’s rights, autonomy, and preferences. Encourage Member States to invest in age-friendly, dementia-inclusive and disability-inclusive environments, ensuring public spaces, transport, housing, and digital services are accessible to all. Promote greater recognition and support for informal and family carers, including access to information, respite, flexible work arrangements and social protection. Facilitate shared learning on integrated and person-centred models of care."

To do this well, the focus needs to shift from policy ambition to practical delivery with an emphasis on implementation, equity, and collaboration across Member States and sectors. Driving implementation and delivery There is already strong policy direction at EU level, particularly in areas such as disability rights, long-term care, digital transformation, healthy ageing and public health. The challenge now is not a lack of strategy but implementation. The Presidency can make a significant difference by supporting shared monitoring and reporting systems, enabling bidirectional learning between Member States, and encouraging the targeted use of EU funding to scale what works, rather than reinventing new approaches. Promoting Inclusion, Participation and Brain Health A healthier and more equitable Europe must prioritise inclusion and equitable access to services and opportunities. Central to this is supporting wellbeing across the lifespan including brain health as part of prevention and healthy ageing. We know more than ever before about how brain health can be protected, how risks can be reduced, and how people can be supported to live well for longer. There is momentum, evidence and public interest and now is a unique moment to act on it. Priorities should include advancing a European initiative on brain health, progressing age-friendly, disabilityinclusive and dementia-inclusive approaches, and tackling the digital, geographic and socio-economic barriers that continue to shape access to care, information and innovation. Strengthening Workforce and Community Capacity Europe’s changing demographics mean we must plan and invest now in the future workforce and care systems. The Presidency can support this by highlighting the importance of recruitment, training and retention across health and social care, while recognising and better supporting informal and family carers who form the backbone of support systems across the EU. Equally, community-based, integrated models of care must continue to be prioritised, as they promote independence, dignity and social connection. Building Dementia-Inclusive Communities Ireland has a unique opportunity to make a lasting impact on the lives of people living with dementia and their family carers, an impact that will resonate not only within Ireland but across Europe. A dementia-inclusive community can be described as a city, town, or village where people with dementia are understood, respected, and supported, and where they feel confident in contributing to community life. In such communities, awareness and understanding of dementia are widespread, and those living with the condition have choice and control over their daily lives. Ireland is already taking important steps toward this vision. The ASI is rolling out its Friends of ASI initiative nationwide, encouraging individuals, businesses, and services to create welcoming and supportive environments. This initiative works in tandem with the HSE’s Dementia: Understand Together campaign, a national partnership involving ASI, Age Friendly Ireland, Age & Opportunity, the Dementia Services Information and Development Centre, and Healthy Ireland."

Rather than focusing solely on high-level policy language or institutional processes, the emphasis should be on what EU cooperation means in practice. Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways to connect policy with lived experience. When we speak about the benefits of EU membership for people with dementia and their carers, abstract concepts become meaningful through real-life stories. For example, cross-border healthcare initiatives allow families to access specialist services beyond their own country, while EU-funded respite programmes provide carers with much-needed support. These experiences highlight how European solidarity translates into everyday improvements in quality of life. The values of EU membership are made tangible through these lived realities. Solidarity is expressed when countries work together so carers never feel isolated. Human rights are upheld by ensuring the dignity and autonomy of people living with dementia. Equality is reinforced by guaranteeing fair treatment regardless of where someone resides in Europe. Community is fostered through EU projects that bring carers together to share ideas and mutual support. Innovation is advanced through EU research funding, which drives new treatments and care models that directly benefit families. During the Presidency, communication channels play a vital role in making these values visible and accessible. Community workshops – such as dementia cafés, carer support groups, and local health centres – can host EUthemed sessions that connect policy to everyday life. Accessible media, including short radio spots, subtitled videos, and illustrated brochures, ensures that information reaches diverse audiences. Carer networks, in partnership with dementia-friendly organisations, provide trusted platforms to co-deliver messages. Symbolic events, such as lighting dementia-friendly landmarks with the EU flag, reinforce the sense of belonging to a wider European community. The beneficial impact of these efforts is profound. People with dementia feel included and valued as European citizens. Carers gain practical awareness of the supports and rights available to them through EU membership. Communities, in turn, strengthen their sense of solidarity, recognising that they are part of a collective European effort to uphold dignity, equality, and innovation in dementia care."

Every day, we provide services and supports designed to meet the needs of people living with dementia and their families, while also advocating for their rights. Our vision is simple but powerful: an Ireland where people on the dementia journey are valued, can realise their rights, make their own choices, and live well in the place they call home. As a national non-profit organisation, the ASI is committed to empowering and championing the voices of people with dementia and their carers. One of the ways we do this is through the Alzheimer National Helpline, which offers information and support to anyone affected by dementia. Beyond the Helpline, the ASI provides a wide range of services including Day Care, Day Care at Home, Home Care, Family Carer Training, Dementia Advisers, Alzheimer Cafés, and Social Clubs. The ASI is especially excited to announce that Ireland will host the prestigious 36th Alzheimer Europe Conference from October 27th-29th 2026, at the Convention Centre Dublin. The theme of the conference, “Sláinte: Building momentum in dementia through policy, research and partnership”, reflects our shared commitment to progress. More than 1,500 delegates from across Europe are expected to attend. This will be listed as an Official event of Ireland’s Presidency programme. This conference comes at a crucial time. Dementia is becoming more prevalent in Ireland, placing increasing pressure on families, communities, and the healthcare system. With Ireland set to hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the conference offers a unique opportunity to put dementia firmly on both national and European policy agendas. The event will bring together people living with dementia, family carers, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to share knowledge, shape policy, and inspire innovation in care and treatment. Importantly, advocates living with dementia and family carers will play a central role, ensuring their voices are heard in discussions about research and advocacy. Hosting this event marks a significant milestone in Ireland’s ongoing commitment to improving the lives of people affected by dementia. In addition to this, there is a strong foundation for leadership in the dementia space in Ireland, with the National Dementia Strategy, launched in 2014 and reviewed in 2018, placing a focus on awareness, timely diagnosis, integrated services, training, research, and leadership. The landmark Model of Care for Dementia in Ireland (2023) builds on the National Dementia Strategy setting specific targets and practice recommendations underpinned by the principles of citizenship, a person-centred approach, integration, personal outcome focused support and timeliness. Dementia must be recognised as a European public health and human rights priority. During its Presidency, Ireland can advance dementia policy through collaboration with Alzheimer Europe, national strategies, and broader Council of Europe frameworks on rights and social inclusion. By doing so, Ireland would not only strengthen its domestic response but also set a precedent for embedding dementia into pan-European rights-based legislation."

The crucial answers here are for Q.4 and Q.5. This is Ireland’s eighth presidency and the previous seven have all been great successes. This is something we do very well and the hard-work and planning over many years pays off. The suggestions here are attempts to show how we can better communicate our vision to our own internal audiences, creating a sense of shared ownership, and offering a model that will be studied and imitated by others. Using a catchy, inclusive, over-arching slogan to show what this presidency is about, for example something like ‘Our Europe: Secure, Trusted, and Ready for the Future’, I believe the priorities should follow the EU Strategic Agenda for 2024-29 while including dimensions that shows a distinct Irish influence and direction. Whatever priorities are chosen they should reflect Ireland’s distinctive strengths and our ability respond to Europe’s evolving challenges. These could be: 1. Strengthening European Security and Technological Resilience This presidency is an opportunity to show that Ireland is not a weak link in the chain of European security, but a country that can make a significant contribution to our common defence and shared security. One area is in the realm of cybersecurity and emerging technologies. Ireland has genuine world-class expertise here and can show that while we may not have the biggest military capabilities, we do have the technological skills and expertise to help defend against hybrid threats, cyberattacks, and misinformation. Our Institute has collaborated on different projects with ADAPT, the national research centre with leading expertise in the area of AI and cybersecurity, which will become part of DANÚ, the new Research Ireland National Centre for AI in late 2026. Together we have the expertise and the framework for communicating that expertise. We can ensure that Ireland can contribute meaningfully to advancing a Union that protects all its citizens while remaining open, democratic, and rights-respecting. 2. Renewing Democratic Trust, Civic Participation and Public Engagement in Open Debates. Democratic trust is under strain across Europe. Part of the problem is that we have become intolerant of other points of view, entrenched in our own positions, susceptible to external influence and manipulation, and unwilling to embrace complexity. In Ireland we have one of the best educational ecosystems in the world, so let’s demonstrate how that power can be mobilised for the greater good. By drawing on our own traditions of deliberative democracy, civic dialogue and open debate we can lead efforts to strengthen democratic resilience. This is an area where the Arts and Humanities (and Social Sciences) can have a pivotal role to play. 3. Securing a Sustainable, and Competitive Future for All Ireland should lead on how the EU can implement the green and digital transitions in a way that protects competitiveness, supports SMEs, and ensures no region is left behind. Ireland can show how it is possible to develop policies that enhance well-being, sustainability, and economic opportunity."

Showing how we can present a new vision, and new leadership of supporting democratic confidence and social cohesion. Showing how we can advance a fair, affordable green and digital transition. Channelling the very best of our research we can show how we can ensure the EU is better able to address AI-related risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and technological dependencies, and that we can develop co-ordinated approaches to hybrid threats, including disinformation, deepfakes, and electoral interference. The presidency is an opportunity to show how democracy itself can be reenergised by nurturing a more engaged and informed citizenry. Engaging with researchers across all our institutions and encouraging them to engage with schools across the country to reach the next generation of thinkers, we can explore how to tackle these challenges, encouraging open debate and a respect for divergent points of view. This will also help provide people with the tools for countering disinformation. Developing and scaling civic participation mechanisms and digital literacy programmes could provide a model of transparent citizen-engagement that could be shared across Member States. This would help the EU in upholding its values globally and internally. We can show how we can provide better practical supports for business competitiveness, simplifying regulation, allowing better access to EU funding, and showing how SMEs can innovate efficiently and securely."

Ireland has a great European story, stretching back across many centuries, and taking on a new focus and direction after 1973. However it is a story that is not really fully appreciated or understood. What does it mean to be Irish and European? What has Europe done for Ireland and how has Ireland helped make Europe the great community of nations and the force it is today? To create a sense of ownership among our citizens about our forthcoming Presidency we need to frame all communications around real-life impacts: security, opportunity, trust, fairness, and a genuine European community. Avoiding jargon and acronyms, we should show how our membership protects rights, strengthens our country, expands our economic prospects, offers the greatest collective security in an increasingly unstable world, and helps create a better future for all of us across Europe. In practice this could mean hosting regional dialogues, community workshops and town-halls, partnering with universities and local authorities and various groups in civil society. The universities and technological universities provide a perfect place to help host and direct some of these engagements, and could reach out to schools across the country so that a younger generation is part of these conversations. This is about storytelling. Statistics are impressive when you know the context, but otherwise they can feel impersonal and meaningless. We need case studies of what Europe really means, in terms of families, entrepreneurs, students, farmers, researchers, artists, and activists. We can show the lived benefits of EU membership, what it meant for us in the 1970s and what it continues to mean. And we should trust our people with the truth. We have difficult decisions to make around defense and security; we need to play our part and we need to be seen to be playing our part. Let’s have these conversations, perhaps hosted by our universities and research institutes exploring everything from cybersecurity to drone attacks to other threats to our very existence. We can show our European partners that we are facing our challenges head on, and we can show our citizens that we trust them with the most complex of issues. In effect, these could be informal citizens’ assemblies, involving a greater range of people, and across the entire country. We should seek to foster a sense of ownership and pride and engagement around our forthcoming presidency. Instead of telling people why Europe matters or what this presidency is about, let’s show people, and let’s make our communities a part of it. For example, we could send a short pack to schools over the summer and have a competition, with different categories of awards and prizes for different age groups. These entries could then be shared and published online. As explore below we can find ways to include all schools and educational institutions across the country."

We have about 750 post-primary, second-level schools in the country. We have over 3000 primary schools. We have 26 other member states. Let’s try and involve them all in this European story. Storytelling is what Ireland is famous for, it is part of our international reputation, and it is what we do best. So let’s craft and tell a great European story. There are opportunities and potential here for collaborations and projects across our member states. Let’s have our students in primary schools find our about Europe, in ways that are meaningful and understandable, from simple packs where they can colour the flag and learn about European capitals and landmarks, to finding our about roaming, and cheaper travel, and the euro, and even how Ireland and Europe has changed so much over the past 50 years. A more advanced package for post-primary students could de developed. Could we twin each school with a school in one of the 26 other member states? What better way could they learn about other students and other cultures and what we have in common. Thanks to the most accessible of technology we can video conference with schools and young people around Europe. And through our 12 universities and technological universities we can link with the other 26 member states and do a series of events and collaborations that can explore, debate, and exchange ideas. We have Irish students and researchers in every member state. We have students and researchers from every member state in our universities. Even showing this on a map of Europe, with threads connecting each country and point of contact, is a way of showing how interconnected we are. Collectively those threads will show the strongest of fabrics, because they will reveal how numerous and extensive they are. Erasmus + was a great achievement of our 2013 presidency,. Let’s try and bring together, through online collaborations, some of the people who have benefitted from Erasmus+ from across member states, old and new. How they benefitted, where they went, what it meant. The European story in action. Working together. Sharing stories."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (nonlegislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness. By focusing on these targeted initiatives, Ireland can use its Presidency to deliver practical, measurable impacts on citizen safety, health equity, and cross-border emergency preparedness while reinforcing the EU’s social and legal frameworks."

For individuals with serious allergies, policies that improve emergency response, access to medicines, and accurate allergen information can be life-saving. For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives. Replicating Ireland’s best practice on emergency medicine access would ensure that life-saving intervention is available regardless of where a reaction occurs, reducing inequalities across Member States."

The 2026 Presidency can show how EU cooperation protects people, strengthens communities, and makes daily life safer—particularly in areas such as emergency preparedness for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. This people-centred framing will strengthen public trust, build ownership, and demonstrate the concrete value of Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

Within that framework, Ireland can deliver unique added value by prioritising a human rights–based, public-health–centred approach to drug policy, grounded in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Upholding dignity (Article 1), life (Article 2), non-discrimination (Article 21) and healthcare (Article 35) should be central to the Presidency’s thematic vision. A key priority should be strengthening Europe’s response to an increasingly toxic and unstable drug landscape, in line with both the Strategic Agenda and the European Commission’s 2026 Work Programme, which highlights health protection, crisis preparedness, and social resilience. Ensuring universal access to life-saving interventions—naloxone without prescription, OAMT, stimulant agonist treatment, drug checking, and community-led safe consumption spaces—should be championed as essential to the protection of health and life across the Union. The Presidency should also help the EU realign its approach with modern international guidance. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk recently called for “a transformative approach… that prioritises health, dignity, and inclusion.” His statements reinforce the need for policies that are “gender-sensitive and evidence-based,” support “inclusive access to voluntary medical care,” and highlight that harmful criminalisation must be replaced by humane, public-health approaches. His clear call for decriminalisation, combined with support for responsible regulation—especially at a time when seven European states already operate cannabis regulation models—supports another key thematic priority: fostering structured EU dialogue on legal regulation and emerging global reforms. Finally, Ireland should elevate the meaningful participation of people who use drugs in EU policymaking as a Presidency priority. This aligns with the Strategic Agenda’s emphasis on strengthening democracy and inclusion, ensures policy relevance, and enhances the EU’s capacity to respond to evolving drug market realities. Through these thematic priorities, Ireland can help operationalise the values embedded in Europe’s 2024–2029 strategy, set the tone for the Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2026, and position the EU as a global leader in rights-based, life-saving drug policy."
248,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ecbe9cca/European_Network_of_People_who_Use_Drugs_EuroNPUD_-_Submission_248.docx,European Network of People who Use Drugs (EuroNPUD),,,,2,"Ireland’s 2026 Presidency should ensure that Council work reflects the European Commission Work Programme for 2026, the EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, and the forthcoming Joint Declaration on Legislative Priorities for 2026. Within these overarching frameworks, several concrete policy areas deserve focused attention. Embedding Human Rights in EU Drug Policy Legislation The Presidency should work to anchor all drug-related legislative files within the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This includes integrating the International Guidelines on Human Rights and Drug Policy, echoed in Volker Türk’s call for policies that “prioritise health, dignity, and inclusion.” Legislative discussions should also reflect his statement that “decriminalisation is another crucial step” and that EU policy must “treat the person, not punish the drug use disorder.” Harmonising EU Access to Harm Reduction Services Ireland should promote legislative progress on universal access to naloxone (including non-prescription models), OAMT, stimulant agonist therapies, drug checking, and safe consumption spaces. Türk’s reminder that “harm reduction measures… are essential” supports elevating these interventions within EU health and social policy files. EU Overdose Prevention Strategy & Naloxone Standards Legislation or Council conclusions should support harmonised naloxone provision across Member States, including peer distribution and integration into emergency, prison, and community services. This aligns directly with EU priorities on public health and resilience identified in the 2026 Work Programme. EU Recognition of Drug Checking Services Ireland should advance legal or regulatory recognition of drug checking as a public health service. Enabling Member States to implement mobile, nightlife, and community-based drug checking supports early warning capacities prioritised in the Strategic Agenda. Modernising EU Early Warning and Monitoring Systems The Presidency should promote reforms that incorporate community-generated data and peer worker expertise into EU drug market monitoring. This policy area supports EU objectives around preparedness, resilience, and data-driven governance. EU Dialogue on Decriminalisation and Responsible Regulation Ireland should convene structured EU-level dialogue—consistent with Türk’s call for collaboration—on decriminalisation and emerging regulatory models. With seven European states already implementing cannabis regulation, the EU must begin taking stock of lessons learned, alongside longstanding and innovative developments in heroin-assisted treatment, ketamine therapy, and psilocybin reform. Ensuring Participation of People Who Use Drugs in Law-Shaping Processes Ireland should ensure legislative processes reflect democracy and inclusion by involving experiential experts and peer-led organisations in Council dialogues and preparatory work. Aligning these policy priorities with EU strategic documents will help advance coherent, rights-based reforms across the Union."

Scaling up harm reduction—naloxone, OAMT, drug checking, and safe consumption spaces—will immediately reduce preventable deaths, hospital pressures, and community harm. These outcomes advance the Strategic Agenda’s objectives on public health resilience and improving living standards. Embedding human rights into EU drug policy will strengthen social cohesion, reduce inequalities, and enhance trust in institutions. As Volker Türk emphasises, replacing punitive measures with “inclusive access to voluntary medical care and other social services” improves the health and wellbeing of individuals, families, and communities. Improving early warning systems and responding to supply toxicity will enhance community safety and reduce poisonings. This directly supports the Strategic Agenda’s focus on crisis preparedness and citizen protection. Additionally, structured dialogue on decriminalisation and responsible regulation—now increasingly relevant as seven European states regulate cannabis—can reduce criminal market harms, support social reintegration, and lower the costs of enforcement. Türk’s call for regulation that “eliminates profits from illegal trafficking, criminality and violence” underscores the broader societal benefits. Businesses and communities will also benefit from stabilised nightlife environments, reduced emergency callouts, and stronger public trust in local and EU institutions. Involving peer-led organisations strengthens democratic inclusion—a central goal of the Strategic Agenda—and ensures policies are informed by those with lived experience, increasing both effectiveness and public legitimacy."

Using language consistent with respected international human rights leadership can enhance trust—especially Volker Türk’s call for policies that “prioritise health, dignity, and inclusion.” This reinforces the EU’s own Charter commitments and counters misinformation or punitive narratives. Citizen engagement should include participatory events, dialogues with civil society, and visibility for peer-led organisations. This aligns with the Strategic Agenda’s focus on strengthening democracy and fosters a sense that citizens—not institutions alone—shape the EU. Highlighting Ireland's leadership role, including its hosting of EuroNPUD, reinforces how local civil society contributes to EU direction-setting. Transparent reporting and accessible storytelling about the Presidency’s achievements will further build connection and ownership."

The programme of the Danish EU Presidency for 2025 contains one mention of circularity, and positions of Cyprus (and later Lithuania) remain unclear on this matter. Ireland’s Presidency offers a crucial opportunity to truly prioritise the circular economy as a core aspect of the EU’s competitiveness and resilience. Ireland and Europe both have important targets set for 2030 relating to the circular economy. Ireland’s draft Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy contains a ‘vision is for Ireland to become a recognised leader in circularity by 2030’ while the EU’s Competitiveness Compass aims to make the EU the world leader in the circular economy by 2030. The EU’s Clean Industrial Deal also contains an ambition to double Europe’s circular economy rate by 2030 from 12 to 24%. These targets must be approached with pragmatism and realism. With just over four years until 2030, all opportunities must be leveraged to take stock of where we are currently and to identify risks and compliance gaps. Ireland has the platform to ensure harmonisation and a level playing field at a key moment for the European Union. The EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 emphasises the importance of ‘making a success of the green and digital transitions,’ aiming toward a ‘more circular and resource-efficient economy.’ The Commission Work Programme for 2026 also contains many files relating to the circular economy, creating an opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate its leadership. SIMPLIFICATION AND COMPETITIVENESS Over the past five years, several major EU laws such as the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESP-R) and Right to Repair Directive have been adopted, with secondary legislation to follow many of these packages in the coming years. Ireland’s Presidency offers a strong opportunity to take stock of the existing ‘compliance maze’ acting as a barrier to achieving a true circular economy. This means addressing regulatory fragmentation and removing barriers to legislative harmonisation."

ENVIRONMENTAL OMNIBUS (Q4 2025 ) This Omnibus is a package of six legislative proposals. Further debate will be needed on details of this proposal. Some early industry considerations are: We welcome the proposal of the Commission to discontinue the Substances of Concern in Products (SCIP) Database. The database has proven to be a costly failure, imposing substantial administrative and financial burdens on manufacturers without achieving its intended purpose or improving recycling outcomes*. There is some concern regarding the proposal of the Commission to suspend the application of the rules on the appointment of authorised representatives (AR) for extended producer responsibility (EPR) for waste, waste electrical and electronic equipment and single use plastic waste until 1 January 2035. The European Commission stipulates this obligation will be suspended for European producers while further streamlining of the EPR schemes under the Circular Economy Act is pending. The AR system is a key mechanism of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), ensuring compliance with WEEE collection, treatment, and financing obligations. Further discussion and debate will be required on this matter*. CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (Q4 2025) In addition to introducing further anti-circumvention measures and export compensation, the CBAM proposal will expand the scope to include downstream products. At present, only raw materials such as aluminium, steel, and cement are covered by CBAM, while finished goods made from these materials (e.g., washing machines, dishwashers) are not. This gap exposes the mechanism to carbon leakage and places EU manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage, since equivalent carbon costs are not applied to imported finished products. THE OMNIBUS TO SIMPLIFY ENERGY PRODUCT LEGISLATION (Q2 2026) This presents a valuable opportunity to resolve overlaps and duplication between the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) and other harmonised legislation, such as chemicals, packaging, and waste rules. THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT ACT (EPA) (Q3 2026) This will include updates to rules on market surveillance and the compliance of products. It is an Act that will drive crucial enforcement measures enabling existing legislation to realise its intended ambition. The EPA will also address standardisation measures, updating the New Legislative Framework (NLF) on product rules. The revision of the existing framework under the EPA should also tackle the issue of non-compliant products on online marketplaces by placing more possibilities on trades and platforms. THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY ACT (Q3 2026) Ireland must take stock of the effectiveness of the existing WEEE Directive. It is an important opportunity to highlight priority issues such as harmonised EPR frameworks, realistic collection targets, and measures to incentivise CRM recovery. Government has already recognised that methodology for EEE ‘does not take account of the varying lifecycles of certain electrical and electronic equipment’ such as washing machines and refrigerators5.’ Any updated methodology or targets should consider the lifespan of an electronic product through repair and reuse. It will also be important to address the significant distortion of collection targets caused by the inclusion of new product streams with exceptionally long lifespans. Specifically, products such as heat pumps and photovoltaic (PV) panels have operational lives of 15 years or more. Their inclusion in current ""Put on Market"" (POM) figures artificially inflates short-term collection targets to a level that is fundamentally unachievable, as these items will not enter the waste stream for a significant period of time. The current WEEE system is disproportionately focused on collection quantity (weight), often to the detriment of recovery quality. This emphasis can conflict with our shared core environmental and sustainability objectives."
136,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/0bb6d301/White_Goods_Association_-_Submission_136.docx,White Goods Association,,,,3,"The European Commission has estimated that the current circular material use rate in the EU is 11.8%6. In just over four years, the EU is aiming to double this. In the meantime, we are struggling as a Member State and as an EU bloc to accurately gauge both our WEEE collection rates and our critical raw materials recovery. The adage that you ‘cannot manage what you cannot measure’, rings true even more when discussing matters relating to the circular economy. Creating a stable market for secondary raw materials can be achieved by introducing economic incentives and investing in recycling infrastructure and R&D. Ensuring the quality of recycled materials is appropriately advocated for will be essential to ensure and promote a balanced market and to promote consumer trust. This will benefit people, business and communities. We support ambitions at the EU level to significantly strengthen enforcement mechanisms, consistently applying them across all Member States to combat non-compliance, such as illegal exports and ""free riding"" by online sellers. A level playing field means addressing compliance gaps and market barriers, ensuring loopholes in existing legislation are addressed in a timely and proportionate manner. An “all actors” approach must be taken to ensure accountability across the entire value chain. In certain instances, a level playing field may entail an interpretation of compliance that transcends a mere ‘letter of the law’ approach, particularly regarding WEEE takeback. These measures, if promoted through the Irish Presidency, will enable us to achieve a truly harmonised Single Market for Waste. Additionally, circularity and economic growth must be seen as symbiotic. A circular economy is a thriving economy."

Ireland is uniquely well placed to spearhead the way on these files. The WGA welcomes the opportunity provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (“The Department”) to provide industry views on how Ireland can best fulfil its Presidency role.

Furthermore, this system is redundant because substances of very high concern (SVHCs) are already subject to mandatory reporting under the REACH Regulation (Article 33). On the Commission’s proposal on AR’s - Currently this is a mandatory requirement. It has helped address the significant problem of ""free-riders""—producers who sell EEE remotely but fail to register or finance WEEE management in the destination country. The AR must fulfil the producer's WEEE obligations, such as registration, reporting, and compliance enforcement, in that local market"

We believe that Ireland’s Presidency should adopt the high-level theme of ""Competitiveness through Innovation: A Scale-up First Europe."" Reflecting the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 regarding a ""prosperous and competitive Europe"", Ireland is uniquely positioned to champion the indigenous tech sector. To this end, we propose three themes: 1. Accelerating the Single Market for Capital: Addressing the funding gap is the single greatest challenge for European scale-ups. Ireland should prioritise the completion of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) and the Savings and Investment Union. It is Scale Ireland’s belief that we need to use this opportunity to drive both economic growth as well as sectoral resilience. A functional CMU is essential to mobilise private capital, ensuring Irish and European start-ups can scale globally without relocating to the US or Asia to access growth finance. 2. Digital Leadership & AI Sovereignty: Building on Ireland’s reputation as a digital hub, the Presidency should focus on securing Europe’s AI, digital and cyber talent pipeline. The priority must be to elevate Ireland’s leadership in enhancing Europe's digital capabilities, moving beyond regulation to active adoption and innovation. Alongside other members of the Department of Enterprise’s Digital Advisory Forum, we believe we should work to secure the ""AI, digital and cyber talent pipeline"" by hosting an ambitious AI Summit to showcase European capability. 3. Regulatory Simplicity (""Think Small First""): The Presidency should champion a competitive and simplified digital rulebook. The priority should be reducing the administrative burden on high-growth companies. We advocate for a ""28th Regime"" approach - an optional standardised legal framework for companies to trade across the EU without navigating 27 different legal systems, making the Single Market a tangible reality for start-ups."

This is critical to creating viable exit strategies for founders and investors within Europe. 2. Implementation of the AI Act & Digital Rulebook: As the AI Act moves into full implementation, the Presidency must ensure that the compliance burden does not stifle early-stage innovation. Work should focus on the European AI Office to ensure an SME focus and that ""regulatory sandboxes"" are accessible and effective for start-ups, not just incumbents. We strongly believe that we need to champion and deliver a competitive and simplified digital rulebook, ensuring interoperability and open markets are preserved. 3. Talent & Employee Ownership (ESOPs): To secure the talent pipeline, the Presidency should advance the EU Talent Pool initiative and push for the mutual recognition of qualifications in deep-tech sectors. Crucially, Ireland should lead discussions on the harmonisation of Stock Option (ESOP) treatment across Member States. Promoting a unified, attractive framework for employee ownership is vital for start-ups to attract top-tier talent against global competitors. This would leave taxation issues to member states. 4.

These mandates are crucial in ensuring regulatory certainty for e-kerosene producers, but also aviation fuel suppliers who are responsible for reaching the targets, and airlines who will be using the e-kerosene. As tools are deployed the create more financial certainty and de-risk investments in e-fuel production (through the double sided auction system announced in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan for instance), it is of utmost importance that the mandates stay where they are. We therefore recommend the Irish Presidency to follow the Commission’s lead on keeping the changes to minimal adaptations on the anti-tankering rules, should the Commission in fact make such a legislative proposal, and ensure no amendments are tabled outside of this scope. On FEUM, the Commission has indicated it sought to review the regulation along with the EU ETS, which is planned in Q3 2026. The Regulation clearly states it should be reviewed if and when a global fuels standard is adopted. As the next vote for the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF) is only expected in October 2026, there is a timing mismatch. We would like to urge to Irish Presidency to ensure any legislative proposal for an amendment of FEUM by the Commission is only looked into once the IMO NZF is approved. Revision of the Energy Taxation Directive: The aviation industry continues to benefit from a privileged fiscal regime across the EU, which directly affects the ability of less emitting sectors to compete on a level playing field. This preferential tax treatments currently afforded to fossil-fuel-powered flights and ships. artificially strengthens the competitive position of high-emitting aircraft and fuels. . This fiscal regime stems from the Energy Tax Directive (ETD), a Directive adopted more than 20 years ago and which must now be revised to reflect the EU’s current strategic priorities. We recommend addressing this in the revision by clearly and unequivocally authorising the taxation of aviation fuels both for intra-EU and international flights through a revision of the ETD, as initially proposed by the Commission in 2021. Revenues generated from fossil fuel taxation via the revision of Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), or other aviation-related revenue streams must be reinvested into the development of sustainable alternative fuels, clean technologies, and renewable low-carbon industrial base. This is critical not only from an equity perspective, but also for ensuring that emerging clean technologies can compete on a genuinely level playing field."

Europe faces an urgent need to decarbonise its economy in line with its 2040 climate targets, and the Presidency offers a pivotal opportunity to provide the political leadership necessary to translate ambition into concrete action. The EU Council plays a central role in this process. By bringing together the governments of all member states, it coordinates legislative priorities, ensures alignment across national policies, and facilitates consensus on key climate and energy dossiers. During the Irish Presidency, the Council can accelerate negotiations on critical files such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), RFEUA/FEUM, and the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD), enabling timely adoption and effective implementation of measures that drive decarbonisation and innovation across the Union. Policies such as the EU ETS, RFEUA, and the ETD are essential instruments in this effort. The EU ETS provides cost-effective mechanisms to reduce emissions while sending clear market signals that stimulate investment in zero-carbon technologies. RFEUA/FEUM and the ETD accelerate the adoption of sustainable fuels, improve energy efficiency, and ensure taxation aligns with climate objectives. By coordinating these policies effectively, the Irish Presidency can create a predictable regulatory environment that encourages businesses to invest in innovation, helping European companies lead the global transition to clean energy and low-emission transport. The Presidency can also reinforce Europe’s strategic energy sovereignty. By reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and promoting domestic renewable energy and sustainable fuel production, the EU strengthens its resilience to energy price volatility and geopolitical pressures. This benefits communities across Europe by safeguarding energy security, supporting local industrial growth, and generating employment in emerging sectors such as green aviation and clean technology.

Accountability and transparency should be viewed as competitive advantages that attract investment and safeguard democracy. Ireland will begin the next Trio cycle and should set the tone with a re-affirmation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights ahead of the charter’s twentieth anniversary in 2027. In addition, and as the deadline for the UN SDGs draws closer (2030), Ireland should draw on its experience as Co-Chair of the UN SDG development to accelerate existing shared EU and UN SDG aims. Competitiveness: Ireland’s Presidency should drive Europe’s competitiveness agenda, particularly in research and innovation. New technologies, including AI, bring huge opportunities; Europe must be at the forefront of the responsible development and ethical application of these technologies. Education and research are central to Europe’s future prosperity. The Presidency will coincide with high-level negotiations on FP10 and the next Erasmus programme; Ireland should advocate for continued investment in research and education and the Union of Skills (including life-long learning) to ensure the EU can deliver the objectives of its competitiveness compass. To be competitive, however, Europe must also be resilient. Sustainability in its widest sense (economic, social and environmental) should be a core tenet of the Presidency. Europe will only be resilient to climate or political-induced shocks to economic systems, supply chains, export markets, labour markets, financial markets if we have resilient natural systems, and resilient communities and populations. A wide range of mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary to address the climate crisis and these must be aligned to European values.

Security: Competitiveness and security are interconnected. Ireland's comparative advantage lies in convening diverse stakeholders to translate policy into practice. The Presidency should leverage this capacity to advance the competitiveness-values-security nexus through transparency mechanisms, facilitating knowledge sharing between member states and demonstrating how smaller states achieve impact through strategic partnership-building. Contributors to actionable strategies should include regulators, law enforcement, civil society, business, and academia."

Universities, communities and business organisations should engage in open discussion to find solutions that deliver a fairer, more secure Europe that aligns with European values. The twin transition: Legislation linked to the green and digital transitions should be prioritised. This includes Fit for 55 Package, the Circular Economy Act, the energy union package, digital fairness, and the education Package (particularly around digital education and skills). Citizen inclusion, talent development, security, and fairness: the Fair Labour Mobility Package, anti-fraud and anti-corruption legislation, the European Product Act, the ERA act and the European integrated framework for climate resilience can all inform a human-centred approach to building a fair society equipped to meet the economic and societal challenges of the climate crisis, the uncertain geopolitical landscape, and increased digitisation. The EC Strategic Agenda 2024-2029: the Irish Presidency should focus on ‘respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.’ It should counter racism, hate speech and hate crime in our local, national and European community. With migration reform a focus of the EU and Council, Ireland must ensure that the EU is an open, safe and welcoming union to all and that migration reform does not feed anti-immigration sentiment. The EC Strategic Agenda also commits to strengthening ‘democratic resilience, including by deepening citizen engagement, protecting free and pluralistic media and civil society, tackling foreign interference and countering attempts at destabilisation, including through disinformation and hate speech.’ Ireland must strive for European cohesion and counter division driven by populist misinformation campaigns, particularly on digital platforms. International Criminal Court: Ireland should advocate for strengthening EU support for the ICC, and ensuring EU foreign policy upholds international humanitarian law in contemporary conflicts. Multi-Annual Financial Framework and European Research Area Act: Ireland should enable the passage of these and, if the European Innovation Act is passed during the Presidency, Ireland must ensure that the impact on universities and their role in the proposals are well identified and understood. EU Asset Recovery Directive: The Presidency should advance Ireland's opt-in to the EU Asset Recovery Directive and enhanced participation in Europol's Project A.S.S.E.T. Equality, diversity, and inclusion: The forthcoming EU Action Plan on Anti-Racism, the EU LGBTIQ Equality Strategy and the 2026-2030 EU Gender Equality Strategy should be prioritised during the Presidency, in addition to the ongoing commitments of the EU Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021 to 2030. Responsible AI frameworks: Ireland can lead on responsible AI frameworks for financial compliance and fraud detection and should also promote legislation enabling cross-border access to public procurement data to detect bid-rigging. The Presidency should also consider how the AI Act will be interpreted within educational settings and how educational policies, practices, and infrastructures should ensure the benefits of AI can be harnessed responsible to accelerate learning opportunities and enhance student and citizen learning while mitigating potential risks. Work of previous Presidency: Progress made during the previous Presidency, such as the Gender Equality Strategy 2026-2030 and intergenerational fairness, should be reflected in Ireland’s Presidency."

Two high-level themes are proposed: 1. Reducing Poverty and Inequality A focus on economic inclusion and social fairness aligns closely with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029. Ireland could highlight policies that protect vulnerable households, support equitable growth, and strengthen the EU’s commitment to tackling poverty both within Europe and globally. Addressing the main drivers of poverty in partner countries is a central part of this effort, especially where lack of access to essential health services directly contributes to lost income, disability, and long-term vulnerability. 2. Strengthening Health Systems and Crisis Preparedness Resilient health systems underpin economic stability, wellbeing and effective crisis response. Ireland could champion measures that address health inequalities, improve access to essential services, and reinforce Europe’s capacity to prepare for and manage future shocks. As part of this, the Presidency could draw attention to significant global health gaps—such as limited access to essential surgical and anaesthetic care—which are closely linked to maternal mortality, avoidable disability, and economic instability in low-resource settings. Highlighting this issue would support EU goals on resilience, poverty reduction and global responsibility. These two priorities offer a clear, people-centred vision for the Presidency, reflecting Ireland’s strengths and aligning with the EU’s long-term strategic objectives while remaining focused and achievable."
65,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dc1509ae/Institute_of_Global_Surgery_RCSI_-_Submission_65.docx,"Institute of Global Surgery, RCSI",Academic,Health,Global reach,2,"A clear and high-impact policy area that Ireland could prioritise during its 2026 Presidency is addressing the funding gap for essential surgical and anaesthetic care within EU external action. This issue sits directly at the intersection of poverty reduction, health-system strengthening, gender equality and economic resilience. Lack of access to basic surgical care is a major, but often overlooked, driver of poverty in low-resource settings. Preventable disability, maternal and neonatal mortality, and loss of income frequently result from conditions that require straightforward surgical intervention. Families often face catastrophic health expenditure when services are unavailable or unaffordable. Despite this, essential surgery remains one of the least funded areas within EU development, humanitarian and research programmes. Ireland could use the Presidency to encourage the Council to: Recognise essential surgical and anaesthetic care as part of the EU’s approach to poverty reduction and health-system resilience. Explore dedicated funding opportunities for surgical capacity-building within Global Europe (NDICI), humanitarian assistance and related EU external instruments. Promote the use of standardised indicators, such as the Lancet Commission’s core surgical metrics, to track progress and ensure accountability in EU-supported health programmes. Addressing this funding gap would support the EU’s Strategic Agenda commitment to a more resilient and globally responsible Europe. It would also build on Ireland’s strengths in global health partnerships, demonstrating leadership in an area where relatively modest investment can deliver substantial and long-lasting social and economic benefits."
65,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dc1509ae/Institute_of_Global_Surgery_RCSI_-_Submission_65.docx,"Institute of Global Surgery, RCSI",Academic,Health,Global reach,5,"A significant area that deserves attention within the wider framework of poverty reduction and health-system strengthening is the global gap in access to essential surgical and anaesthetic care. Around five billion people cannot obtain safe, timely and affordable surgery when needed. This gap contributes directly to avoidable disability, maternal mortality, loss of income and long-term economic vulnerability for households and communities. For many low-resource settings, the inability to access basic surgical care is a major but often overlooked driver of poverty. Despite the clear evidence of impact and cost-effectiveness, essential surgery receives limited attention within current EU development, humanitarian and research funding mechanisms. This funding gap restricts progress in workforce training, emergency preparedness, infrastructure and universal access to essential services. Ireland is well placed to highlight this issue during its Presidency, given its strong record in global health cooperation and its experience with practical, long-term partnerships. The RCSI–COSECSA collaboration, for example, has supported surgical training and capacity-building across East, Central and Southern Africa, demonstrating how sustained support can strengthen health systems and deliver measurable results. Addressing the global surgery funding gap would reinforce EU priorities on fairness, resilience and poverty reduction. It would also reflect Ireland’s commitment to people-centred development and its capacity to provide leadership in areas where targeted action can make a substantial difference."
449,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/666eab1b/Front_Line_Defenders_-_Submission_449.docx,Front Line Defenders,Human Rights Organisation,Human rights defender protection,Worldwide,1,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026 offers a significant opportunity to renew the EU’s commitment to human rights defender (HRD) protection worldwide. Given that Ireland played a critical role in securing the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders in 2004, it is uniquely positioned to lead a Presidency that prioritises their practical and operational implementation. This focus is urgently needed. Front Line Defenders global work shows that HRDs now face increasingly sophisticated and multilayered forms of repression, including digital surveillance, deregistration of their organisations, withdrawal of funding, restrictions on financial transfers, asset freezes, politically motivated sanctioning measures, and the misuse of counter-terrorism frameworks to criminalise and silence peaceful human rights work. In many regions, these criminalisation processes are rooted in business interest and linked to their operations. Across regions, restrictive NGO laws, smear campaigns, digital surveillance, online harassment, and the misuse of cybersecurity and disinformation frameworks have restricted space in which human rights defenders operate. A particular concern documented across multiple regions is the long-term imprisonment of HRDs often following unfair trials. Many defenders are serving sentences of a decade or more, including individuals with EU nationality or strong EU links. These long-term detentions are used strategically: they remove influential voices from public life, intimidate broader communities of defenders and reshape civic space environments in ways that undermine the very values the EU seeks to advance. A high-level theme centered on “Strengthening EU Support to Human Rights Defenders” would allow Ireland to consolidate existing EU tools while elevating the urgent need for sustained, coordinated EU engagement on long term imprisonment cases. As Front Line Defenders experience shows, consistent diplomatic pressure, concrete support to HRDs and visible international engagement can meaningfully shift outcomes whereas inconsistent attention allows repression to deepen. This thematic focus would also allow Ireland to highlight the indispensable contributions of HRDs in documenting violations and working on issues including but not limited to defending environmental rights and land, exposing businesses malpractices, corruption, advancing women’s rights, LGBTI+ rights and preventing conflict, work that directly reinforces EU foreign policy objectives. By placing HRD protection and protecting civic space online and offline, including sustained action on long term imprisonment at the heart of its thematic agenda, Ireland can deliver a Presidency that is principled and operational building directly on Ireland’s legacy in shaping the EU’s HRD protection architecture."
449,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/666eab1b/Front_Line_Defenders_-_Submission_449.docx,Front Line Defenders,Human Rights Organisation,Human rights defender protection,Worldwide,2,"To advance a Presidency theme on strengthening EU support to human rights defenders, Ireland can adopt an ambitious, action oriented approach that enhances the EU’s work in this area without requiring a formal review or legislative change. Ireland could launch a Presidency HRD Protection Initiative. This could include but is not limited to: A targeted focus on HRD protection in selected contexts, focusing on environments where defenders are increasingly targeted through a combination of offline and online repression. Drawing on delegation and embassy practice, EEAS expertise and input from HRDs, this exercise could examine cases involving deregistration, funding withdrawal, asset freezes, misuse of counter-terrorism and sanction frameworks, as well as digital surveillance, online smear campaigns and disinformation attacks. Given global patterns documented by Front Line Defenders, the deep dive should also specifically include environmental and land rights defenders, who remain among the most targeted groups due to their exposure of environmental damage, land grabs, corruption and abuses linked to extractive projects. The objective would be to identify a set of very concrete, actionable measures that the EU, including delegations and Member States embassies, can implement immediately to meaningfully address these trends and strengthen HRD protection. As the next EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy will be negotiated during the Irish Presidency, the findings of this targeted exercise could also directly inform the Action Plan’s HRD operational actions. Ireland would be well placed to ensure that strong existing language on HRDs is preserved and reinforced in the new Action Plan and that it translates into clear, operational expectations for delegations and Member States embassies. Ireland should also use its Presidency to drive a more structured and sustained EU response to the long-term imprisonment of human rights defenders. By leading COHOM in adopting a short list of emblematic cases, including dual EU nationals such as Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja and Dawit Isaak, Ireland could launch a six-month programe of intensified and coordinated EU diplomacy. This could include joint demarches at key moments in each case, regular trial and prison-condition monitoring, strategic capital to capital outreach and consistent, aligned messaging in political dialogues and relevant multilateral fora. Such an approach would help move the EU to a persistent, case based diplomatic strategy, increasing pressure for progress in emblematic cases and signaling to governments worldwide that the long-term detention of HRDs will remain a priority concern throughout the Irish Presidency Ireland should also ensure HRDs are directly heard within the Council of the EU system by encouraging COHOM and relevant Council of the EU working parties, including but not limited to COTER,COJUR, COEST, COMAG, COLAT, COAFR, Mashreq/Maghreb and COJUR, to systematically invite HRDs to brief delegations. Their insights would help ensure that HRD protection concerns are incorporated into policy debates and legislative proposals coming before the Council, including those related to counter-terrorism cooperation, digital regulation, sanctions regimes, AML frameworks, environmental protection and other areas directly affecting defenders. The Irish Presidency should play a role in bridging the EU’s climate and environmental agendas with its human rights and HRD protection commitments, by bringing together the Council formations and working parties that shape these policies. As the EU accelerates its energy transition, Ireland can foster an approach that recognises environmental and land rights defenders as essential partners in ensuring that climate action is both effective and rights-respecting. This could include convening joint discussions between environment, energy, and human rights officials; promoting discussions on a rights-based energy transition; and integrating human rights impacts and HRD protection into renewable-energy and critical-raw-materials projects."
449,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/666eab1b/Front_Line_Defenders_-_Submission_449.docx,Front Line Defenders,Human Rights Organisation,Human rights defender protection,Worldwide,3,"An Irish Presidency that strengthens the EU’s capacity to protect HRDs delivers broad benefits for people, communities and businesses across Europe. HRDs are often the first to identify patterns of corruption, environmental destruction, illicit financial flows, organised crime, abuses linked to extractive industries and big tech, and early warning signs of instability. By enhancing the EU’s ability to act on these insights the Irish Presidency would help reinforce human rights and the rule of law which in turn positively affects European citizens and economies."
449,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/666eab1b/Front_Line_Defenders_-_Submission_449.docx,Front Line Defenders,Human Rights Organisation,Human rights defender protection,Worldwide,4,"Ireland can best communicate the values and benefits of EU membership by highlighting how the EU’s actions directly support people who defend human rights in some of the most difficult environments worldwide. Sharing concrete stories of human rights defenders, environmental HRDs protecting land and water, and resisting corporate malpractices, women HRDs defending equality, journalists HRDs uncovering corruption helps illustrate the tangible impact of EU diplomacy and why EU membership matters. These examples resonate with Irish citizens’ deeply held values of fairness, solidarity and standing up for those at risk. It its crucial that the Irish Presidency challenges the persistent narrative that HRDs are obstacles to progress or that protecting them undermines economic competitiveness. In reality, safeguarding HRDs, and enforcing human rights and environmental obligations for companies are not burdensome constraints but essential foundations for sustainable development, ethical investment, and public trust. Corporate accountability prevents abuses that ultimately carry high economic, social, and reputational costs, while HRDs often serve as early-warning actors who help identify risks, prevent conflict, and ensure that development benefits the the wider people rather than only a few. Communicating these positive, tangible contributions, showing that strong human rights protections support innovation, stability, and long-term prosperity, can help citizens see EU values not as abstract ideals but as practical tools that strengthens economy and society as a whole. The Presidency also gives Ireland an opportunity to demonstrate how a small Member State can meaningfully shape the EU’s global human-rights agenda. Ireland’s leadership in securing the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders show citizens that Ireland can influence significant EU policy outcomes grounded in principle and credibility. Clear, accessible communication can make these issues visible and relatable. Organising exchanges and initiatives with HRDs in Ireland during the Presidency to share first hand experience could deepen public understanding of both the risks they face and the ways the EU can help protect them."

Ireland should ensure it is understood across all EU institutions and member states that respect for human rights must be at the centre of any current and future counter terrorism measures. In particular, ensure that any measures stemming from the new EU Internal Security Strategy (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52025DC0148 ) and the forthcoming new EU Counter Terrorism Agenda are fully compliant with obligations to respect international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law and that human rights experts (including HRDs) are meaningfully consulted in their preparation. The Irish Presidency should also take measures to combat the spreading misuse of Counter Terrorism laws across the world, including in Europe, to restrict or criminalise the legitimate activities of HRDs and others expressing rights to free expression, assembly and association. It should leads discussions to stop the use by the EU of overly broad definitions of terrorism and terrorist activities that often leads to or facilitates this misuse and ensure that the EU does not use or advocate for overly broad definitions of terrorism and terrorist activities in its international cooperation, including multilateral activities and bilateral dialogues with third countries. The Irish Presidency should fully implement the recommendations made to all regional organisations by the UN Special Rapporteur on Promotion and Protection of Human Rights while Countering Terrorism, in his August 2024 report to the General Assembly (https://docs.un.org/en/A/79/324 ) and his March 2025 report to the Human Rights Council (https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/58/47 ) and organise a dedicated Council discussion with a view to carrying out a full assessment of EU implementation of these recommendations. Looking ahead to the European Commission’s 2026 work programme, it is important to also ensure that emerging digital and industrial initiatives, such as the Cloud and AI Development Act, as well as the recently environmental omnibus and digital omnibus, are developed with strong human-rights safeguards, including protections for environmental and land-rights defenders impacted by data-centre expansion and resource use. Likewise, as the EU launches a Critical Raw Materials Centre and revises rules on digital legislation, the Presidency can promote an approach that embeds human-rights due diligence, and HRD protection across these strategic sectors. Front Line Defenders stands ready to elaborate further and to work with Ireland in advancing these recommendations throughout the Presidency."
278,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cfdf0b52/Health_Service_Executive_-_Submission_278.docx,Health Service Executive,HSE,Public Health,National,1,"We propose that Ireland should champion collective coordinated action to reduce health inequities and inequalities across Europe as a high-level thematic priority for its Presidency of the Council. We propose a Dublin/Irish Declaration on Addressing Health Inequalities and Improving Health Equity in Europe, and establishment of EU Mission on Health Equity based in Ireland. Huge progress has been made in Public Health in Europe since Ireland last held this role . Spurred on by the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen great improvements made in emergency planning and response, disease surveillance, genomics, vaccine development and therapeutics. But these benefits have not been shared equally: we have seen widening gaps in experience of morbidity and mortality among people in Europe. People in the EU now live an average of 81.4 years. Yet, a child born in Spain—the country with the highest life expectancy (84 years)—can expect to live more than eight years longer than a child born in Bulgaria, where life expectancy is 75.8 years. Healthy Life Years (HLY) showed an even wider gap, ranging from about 52 to 69 years across the EU—17-years—highlighting that living longer does not necessarily mean living healthier. HLY are decreasing in many countries, with more people becoming ill earlier than in the past. There are also stark differences within countries. The European Social Survey (ESS) shows that people in lower socioeconomic groups are twice as likely to report poor health as those in higher groups. The higher someone’s social position, the more likely they are to live a long and healthy life, a pattern known as the “social gradient in health”. Countries exhibiting higher levels of income inequality tend to have poorer population health outcomes. Such health inequities reflect not only unequal access to healthcare, prevention, screening and vaccine programmes, but also to wider determinants of health, including income distribution, education, employment, housing, air quality, food security, safe spaces and other assets which promote and protect health. The social gradient in health is not fixed. Health improvements vary across socioeconomic groups, with disparities evident by gender, race/ethnicity, and disability highlighting that health inequalities are both avoidable and unjust. Vulnerable and marginalised groups, including some ethnic minorities and migrant populations experience even poorer health These inequalities undermine our shared European values, weaken economic competitiveness, and reduce resilience in the face of geopolitical and environmental crises. To reduce inequalities across the EU, we must address the social gradient in health, improving health for everyone, but at a scale and intensity proportionate to the degree of need. A Presidency anchored in equity would support Member States facing demographic ageing, workforce pressures, and regionally unbalanced development—areas where Ireland can offer recognised leadership. By prioritising health equity Ireland can shape a Presidency that aligns with EU values, enhances quality of life, and strengthens resilience. This would support more inclusive, sustainable development across Europe and ensure that progress in public health benefits everyone."
278,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cfdf0b52/Health_Service_Executive_-_Submission_278.docx,Health Service Executive,HSE,Public Health,National,2,"Ireland should focus its Presidency on driving a whole-of-government, health in all policies, cross-sectoral EU approach to improving health equity and reducing inequities and inequalities. This means that multiple policy sectors, including health and social services, education, housing, employment, and economic policy, must collaborate. While Member States retain primary responsibility for healthcare, education, and social policy, the EU plays a unique decisive role in shaping the structural conditions that influence health, including setting standards on employment protections, consumer and environmental regulation, and market governance. Equality is one of the themes of the Strategic Agenda. A focus on health equity would build on the European Pillar of Social Rights, the European Child Guarantee and the planned Anti-Poverty Strategy, and the themes of recent presidencies (Poland: health security, mental health in children and health promotion and disease prevention; and Denmark: gender equality). It would also contribute to a range of EU supported projects and joint actions targeting cancer, cardiovascular disease, infectious diseases and digital health. Multiple sectors share the need for priority actions on housing, clima The WHO report on the Social Determinants of Health (2008) increased global awareness of health equity. It led to the of the European Commission Communication on Solidarity in Health (2009), followed by Council Conclusions and a reference in the EU 2020 strategy (2010–2020) on ‘‘the need to combat poverty and social exclusion and reduce health inequalities to ensure that everybody can benefit from growth.’’ A focus on health equity would enable the intersecting actions proposed in the 2025 WHO report on Social Determinants of Health Equity: - Addressing economic inequality and investing in social infrastructure and universal public services - Overcoming structural discrimination - Managing the challenges and opportunities posed by the mega-trends of climate change and the digital transformation in a way that systematically promotes health equity. - Putting in place governance arrangements that will maximize the coherence and impact of action. Key areas in which Ireland could lead include: 1. Strengthening EU social and employment protections Legislation relating to working hours, minimum wages, job security, and occupational health and safety has direct impacts on health equity. Ireland can advance initiatives that support fairer labour conditions and reduce socioeconomic vulnerability. 2. Regulating commercial determinants of health EU-level regulations on tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy food are essential to reducing chronic disease and narrowing health gaps. Ireland’s proven leadership in public health legislation, from pioneering smoke-free workplaces to implementing Tobacco 21, puts it in a strong position to drive more ambitious EU-level action 3. Supporting Member State action through EU frameworks Enhanced cooperation on child wellbeing, early learning, housing quality, and environmental justice can help Member States tackle upstream determinants of health equity. By focusing on these areas, Ireland’s Presidency can help deliver lasting improvements in health outcomes and reduce inequities across Europe."
278,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cfdf0b52/Health_Service_Executive_-_Submission_278.docx,Health Service Executive,HSE,Public Health,National,3,"Health inequalities impose substantial economic and social costs across the EU. The European Parliament estimates that these disparities reduce GDP by approximately 1.4%, nearly the equivalent of the EU’s annual defence spending. For Ireland, leadership on health equity would align us with EU economic resilience goals—strengthening labour market participation, productivity, and long-term fiscal sustainability. Tackling health inequalities is not merely a moral imperative but an essential component of economic strategy. Economic losses arise from decreased productivity, lower tax revenues, and increased spending on healthcare and welfare. Current actions, often siloed, are insufficient to counter the deep structural forces that determine social conditions and health outcomes. Consequently, achieving health equity is seen as a vital strategy for strengthening societal resilience, improving competitiveness, and ensuring long-term sustainability. Childhood is a critical period of development, during which the effects of policy can have long-lasting and intergenerational impacts. Several EU states have rising levels of child poverty. A Dublin/Irish Declaration on Addressing Health Inequities and Inequalities in Europe, and establishment of EU Mission on Health Equities based in Ireland as part of the Presidency can support the Council in delivering high-impact initiatives by prioritising equity, prevention, and cross-sector collaboration. A decisive shift towards prevention is critical: prevention is recognised as the first principle of sustainable healthcare and carries a demonstrated return on investment of up to 14:1, making it one of the most effective levers for long-term system sustainability, and reducing the need for healthcare services. This shift aligns with the EU’s transition toward value-based, sustainable healthcare systems—a stated priority for several Member States and the European Commission. Current efforts remain overly focused on treatment, while over 80% of health outcomes are shaped by socioeconomic and environmental factors. Health inequalities persist even in countries that have maintained universal, free healthcare for decades, demonstrating that complementary action in other sectors is always required to ensure equity. Coordinated EU-level action across housing, education, employment, transport, climate, and social protection, anchored in strong preventive and equity focused policies, will generate significant benefits. In 2021, around 75 million people in the EU were living in poverty or at risk of poverty, disproportionately affecting migrants, children, women, and people with lower educational attainment. Income insecurity is identified as one of the main factors accounting for the lack of health equity. There is growing evidence of increasing ill health in working age people from preventable causes, that can cause poverty and social disadvantage. Improving the health of the population is an economic imperative. Improving health equity enhances workforce participation, strengthens competitiveness, builds social cohesion, and increases resilience to future shocks. Actions that reduce inequities benefit businesses through a healthier and more productive labour force, and support communities by creating environments where people can thrive. By focusing on health equity, Ireland’s Presidency can deliver tangible improvements that citizens can feel in their daily lives."
278,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cfdf0b52/Health_Service_Executive_-_Submission_278.docx,Health Service Executive,HSE,Public Health,National,4,"Effective communication of the benefits of EU membership requires clear, people-centred messaging. Ireland could also convene community partnership conversations/dialogues—co-hosted with local authorities and civil society—feeding directly into Council working groups, providing our populations with a visible route into EU policymaking. Ireland could lead on a “Dublin (or other Irish City) Declaration on Health Equity and Addressing Health Inequalities in Europe”, endorsed by all Member States, signalling collective commitment to tackling the social, economic, environmental, and educational conditions that shape the health of the people of Europe. This will support action at Member State level but also across the EU, working with communities and the people we serve, to improve the healthy life expectancy of all our citizens, enabling us to realise the benefits of a healthy population, making Europe a great place to live for everyone, and providing global leadership on tackling health inequities. This Declaration would highlight shared European values, fairness, solidarity, equity, and wellbeing, and communicate that the EU is acting directly on issues that matter to citizens: health, quality of life, access to opportunity, and community resilience. It would also help foster public ownership of the Presidency by demonstrating how EU collaboration produces concrete, visible benefits. EU membership connects directly to people’s lives – awareness of this can be improved through visible signposting of EU support, multimedia participatory formats, and active inclusion of communities and targeted population groups by addressing practical and digital barriers will also address health and wider inequalities. Health is a fundamental human right. Health inequalities affect everyone. Poor health, can lead to a lack of trust, damaging social participation and cohesion and reduce democratic engagement and social stability. Improving health for all makes society stronger, more inclusive, productive, and innovative. Reducing health inequalities is key to Europe’s prosperity, competitiveness, security, and resilience as described in the EU Strategic Agenda. A focus on health equity during the Presidency and the establishment of a mission in Ireland would support to ongoing commitment to improve everyday living conditions, reduce poverty and economic insecurity, address structural discrimination and exclusion, and enhance place-based, community led actions. In Ireland it would build the on the Child Poverty and Wellbeing programme work across sectors - income and joblessness, early learning, cost of education, and family homelessness. Institutions need more dialogue with citizens about their concerns – health inequalities affect everyone and can be framed around rights, solidarity, security and sustainability."
278,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/cfdf0b52/Health_Service_Executive_-_Submission_278.docx,Health Service Executive,HSE,Public Health,National,5,"Health inequalities are differences in health that arise from social disadvantage. They stem from obstacles such as poverty, discrimination, unequal power, and limited access to the resources that help people stay healthy, fair work, safe environments, quality education, good housing, healthcare, and social support. These drivers are known collectively as the social determinants of health. The links below provide an overview of the key issues, challenges, risks, and evidence-based interventions to address health inequities across Europe, drawing on the HSE Position Paper on Health Inequalities, Ireland’s new Public Health Strategy, and EuroHealthNet’s report on social inequalities in health in the EU. The latter report especially uses recent comparable data from across Europe to describe the scale of health inequalities and the social and economic forces driving them. Data also show an increase in mortality rates observed in the lower socioeconomic groups for specific causes of death. This pattern implies that the conditions of deprivation are actively generating premature death, an outcome known as social pathogenesis, rather than simply failing to prevent it. Researchers found rising mortality rates from several conditions, including lung cancer, breast cancer, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disease, and injuries among men and/or women in lower socioeconomic groups in multiple countries, including Finland, Norway, and Denmark. For women, mortality from lung cancer has increased across all surveyed countries, with the strongest increases concentrated among women with low levels of education. The social gradient is not fixed. Health outcomes vary by socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, and disability, demonstrating that health inequalities are avoidable and unjust. They also undermine EU values, weaken competitiveness, and reduce social resilience. Around 75 million people in the EU lived in or at risk of poverty in 2021, disproportionately affecting migrants, children, women, and people with lower levels of education. Income insecurity is one of the five main barriers to health equity, and countries with higher income inequality tend to have poorer population health overall. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities. Mortality impacts were lowest in Nordic countries and highest in Central and Eastern Europe, reflecting pre-existing disadvantage. Long COVID was more prevalent among people with lower education and pre-existing conditions such as obesity, while higher education was protective, offering resources such as health literacy, job control, and the ability to navigate protective measures like vaccination. Structural disadvantage, including discrimination and low institutional trust, also reduced vaccine uptake. Addressing these inequalities is essential for Europe’s competitiveness, security, and resilience—and requires systemic, cross-sector leadership and coordinated action. Ireland’s Presidency can help chart a path toward a more equitable and healthier Europe.

Our priorities should reflect both the European Union’s long-term strategic objectives and the practical needs of citizens and businesses. Three themes stand out as critical: strengthening strategic autonomy, climate action, and simplification. Strategic Autonomy and Resilience Ireland should prioritise strengthening the EU’s strategic autonomy to ensure resilience in an increasingly uncertain global environment. Energy independence must be accelerated through diversification of sources and improved grid interconnections, reducing reliance on external suppliers. Digital sovereignty is equally critical, requiring investment in EU cloud infrastructure and robust cybersecurity standards. Securing supply chains for critical raw materials such as lithium and rare earths will underpin Europe’s industrial competitiveness, while risk mapping and contingency planning will bolster resilience across key sectors. Ireland should also advocate for balanced trade agreements that protect EU interests, while positioning the Union as a global leader in ethical AI and data governance. Finally, strengthening the euro’s international role and reducing dependence on external payment systems will reinforce financial autonomy and economic stability. Climate Action Ireland should champion an ambitious climate agenda during its Presidency, positioning the EU as a global leader in decarbonisation and sustainability. Accelerating the implementation of the Green Deal must be a central priority, with a strong push for timely delivery of Fit for 55 measures and net-zero targets. Harmonising carbon pricing across sectors through a strengthened EU Emissions Trading System will be key to driving emissions reductions efficiently. While Europe already provides subsidies for renewable energy and some tax credits, expanding these measures, alongside introducing effective domestic tax incentives monitored by a robust peer review mechanism, will be key to further mobilising private capital for clean technologies. Our experience advising businesses on transformational decarbonisation projects has shown us that there are challenges associated with accessing the Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe. Further education and experience shares by successful applicants would support more successful outcomes and access to this capital. A robust Just Transition framework is essential to support regions and sectors most affected by decarbonisation, ensuring fairness and social cohesion. Ireland should also advance circular economy legislation, including mandatory recycling targets and eco-design standards, while promoting innovation partnerships in areas such as hydrogen, energy storage, and carbon capture. Finally, climate diplomacy should remain a cornerstone, reinforcing the EU’s leadership in COP negotiations and climate finance. Simplification Simplification, as highlighted in the Draghi report, should focus on reducing regulatory complexity and making EU rules more practical and proportionate. Ireland can lead by promoting a digital-first approach, ensuring that funding applications and compliance processes are fully digitised and user-friendly. At the same time, the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion funds should be streamlined with fewer, clearer rules to ease the administrative burden on farmers and SMEs. Future legislation must also reflect SME-friendly principles, applying proportionality so that smaller businesses are not overburdened by requirements designed for larger enterprises. By embedding Draghi’s vision of simpler, smarter regulation, Ireland can help create a framework that supports competitiveness, innovation, and trust in EU institutions. EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen has stated her aim to cut red tape for MNEs by 25% across the EU. This would certainly make it easier and less costly to do business in the EU, strengthening economic growth which will positively impact our citizens' lives. By focusing on climate action, simplification, and strategic autonomy, Ireland can help the EU deliver on its most pressing challenges while laying the foundations for sustainable growth and resilience. These priorities will not only advance European objectives but also reflect Ireland’s commitment to a fair, innovative, and forward-looking European Union."
396,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dbf6cc45/PwC_Ireland_-_Submission_396.docx,PwC Ireland,,,,2,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council in 2026 should prioritise legislative and policy areas that strengthen Europe’s competitiveness, sustainability, and regulatory clarity. This is a moment to move beyond broad commitments and deliver tangible progress on industrial transformation, tax simplification, and smarter regulation. By focusing on the Clean Industrial Deal, tax and regulatory simplification, and Draghi-inspired measures, Ireland can help the EU achieve its strategic objectives while reducing complexity for businesses and citizens. Tax and Interest Simplification On taxation, Ireland will need to push forward on the simplification of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD), particularly with respect to Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) and Interest Limitation Rules (ILR), which remain overly complex for SMEs and cross-border groups. In parallel, advancing work on the Directive on Administrative Co-operation (DAC), including improvements to data exchange and reporting standards, will strengthen transparency and enforcement. These steps will not only improve the functioning of the single market but also demonstrate Ireland’s commitment to practical, business-friendly solutions. Clean Industrial Deal and Sustainability A key priority should be advancing the implementation of the Net-Zero Industry Act to accelerate the deployment of clean technology manufacturing capacity across Europe, particularly in batteries, hydrogen, and solar. Ireland should also ensure the smooth rollout of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), addressing compliance challenges for SMEs and preparing for its expansion to additional sectors, while promoting consistency of data requirements across regulations—for example, aligning emissions data for CBAM with sustainability reporting and similar needs under the EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation). Following up on the Critical Raw Materials Act will be essential to secure supply chains, with measures such as ambitious recycling targets and strategic stockpiling. In addition, a priority should be to promote activation of the Clean Industrial Deal (CID) tax incentives, such as targeted credits and accelerated depreciation for clean-tech investments. Depending on progress under the Cypriot Presidency, the Government will need to consider whether efforts will be required to get Council agreement on the Energy Taxation Directive to drive industrial decarbonisation and competitiveness across the Union. Finally, revising the Industrial Emissions Directive to tighten standards for heavy industry, while coupling this with innovation funding, will help balance environmental ambition with competitiveness. Better Regulation and Digital-by-Default Ireland should also champion Draghi’s call for a new approach to regulation. Updating the Better Regulation agenda by making administrative burden assessments mandatory for all new legislative proposals, including those under the EU Digital Act and the VAT in the Digital Age (VIDA) initiative, will ensure that rules are proportionate and workable. These measures will help create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation, competitiveness, and trust in EU governance. By focusing on industrial decarbonisation, tax simplification, and smarter regulation, Ireland’s Presidency can deliver concrete outcomes that strengthen Europe’s resilience and competitiveness. These priorities reflect Ireland’s commitment to a forward-looking, practical, and sustainable European Union."
396,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dbf6cc45/PwC_Ireland_-_Submission_396.docx,PwC Ireland,,,,3,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council in 2026 can make a substantial positive impact by focusing on outcomes that citizens and businesses can see and feel. This means delivering policies that strengthen Europe’s global leadership, simplifying everyday interactions with EU systems, and securing long-term competitiveness and resilience. By aligning with the current trio’s priorities while advancing Ireland’s own agenda, the Presidency can help shape a Union that is greener, fairer, and more secure. Positioning the EU as a Global Climate Leader Climate leadership must be at the heart of Ireland’s Presidency. Accelerating decarbonisation policies will not only reduce emissions but also reinforce the EU’s credibility in international climate diplomacy. Ireland should use its term to strengthen the European Union’s influence in global negotiations, encouraging major players such as the US and China to strengthen their commitments. This is about more than targets; it is about demonstrating that Europe can lead by example, combining ambition with practical delivery. By embedding climate considerations into trade, industrial policy, and finance, Ireland can help the EU project a unified voice on sustainability and climate finance, benefiting communities worldwide while creating opportunities for European businesses. Delivering Tangible Benefits for People and Businesses For citizens and SMEs, the most visible impact will come from simplification and accessibility. Ireland should champion measures inspired by Draghi’s recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens and make compliance digital-by-default. The Presidency will also give Ireland the opportunity to champion dialogue between small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the EU institutions, given that goal of the current Commission mandate is to slash red tape by 35% (compared to 25% for MNEs). Streamlined processes for funding applications and reporting will save time and resources, while clearer rules will give businesses confidence to invest and grow. Improving access to EU programmes, particularly for smaller enterprises and local communities, will ensure that the benefits of EU initiatives are widely enjoyed. These changes will not only enhance trust in EU institutions but also demonstrate that Europe can deliver practical solutions to everyday challenges. Advancing the Capital Markets through Savings and Investments Union to secure the EU’s digital future Ireland’s Presidency should also drive progress on advancing the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) given that incentivising venture capital and repurposing household savings into strategic EU business activities is a key EU Commission objective. A 2024 report indicates that the total EU spend on R&D activities amounts to only c.50% of the tech investment by US companies. This is partly attributable to accessing venture capital. Without private investment into EU businesses, it will not be possible for the EU to achieve the broader digital transformation required to keep pace with EU and Chinese equivalent progress in this growth area. By providing a simpler, and tax-efficient route for ordinary citizens to invest in EU businesses, this can deliver tangible benefits for a wide range of EU citizens, whilst also delivering on our technology and AI objectives. By combining climate leadership, regulatory simplification, and accessibility of capital markets, Ireland’s Presidency can deliver real benefits for people, businesses, and communities. This approach will not only align with the Trio’s priorities but also reflect Ireland’s commitment to a competitive, sustainable, and inclusive Europe."
396,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dbf6cc45/PwC_Ireland_-_Submission_396.docx,PwC Ireland,,,,4,"Communicating the values and benefits of EU membership during Ireland’s Presidency is about making the role tangible and relatable. Citizens need to understand what the Presidency means, why it matters, and how it connects to their daily lives. By combining clear explanations, real-life examples, and accessible engagement, Ireland can create a sense of ownership and pride in this national achievement. Explain the Presidency in Simple Terms The first step is clarity. Many people do not know what the Presidency involves, so Ireland should explain it in straightforward language: for six months, Ireland will chair meetings of EU ministers, set agendas, and help broker agreements that shape laws for 450 million people. This is not a ceremonial role—it is a leadership position within one of the world’s largest trading blocs, influencing decisions on climate, trade, security, and more. Framing the Presidency as Ireland’s chance to lead and shape Europe’s future will make its significance clear. Connect EU Benefits to Everyday Life To create a sense of ownership, communication must link EU membership to tangible benefits. Examples such as CAP support for farmers, consumer protections, the abolition of roaming charges, and EU funding for roads, schools, and research show how EU decisions impact daily life. Storytelling is key: share real stories of businesses growing through Single Market access, communities revitalised by cohesion funds, and students thriving through Erasmus+. These narratives make EU membership personal and positive, moving it beyond abstract policy. Ireland is ideally suited to telling this story, given our national economic transformation since joining the EEC in 1973. Show the Presidency as a National Achievement Ireland should emphasise that this is a moment of leadership. As the first in the Trio (with Lithuania and Greece to follow), Ireland sets the tone for 18 months of EU priorities. This is an opportunity to showcase Irish values, fairness, openness, responsibility and innovation, on a European stage. Framing the Presidency as a source of national pride will help citizens see it as their achievement, not just a government role. Engage Through Accessible Channels Communication must be interactive and inclusive. Social media campaigns, local events, and tools like “What the EU does for me” can make information accessible. Short videos, infographics, and community dialogues will help reach diverse audiences. The message should frame Ireland’s EU membership as empowerment, not bureaucracy: Ireland helps shape rules, not just follow them. Linking EU action to global challenges, such as climate leadership and influencing major powers, will underline the relevance of Ireland’s role in a changing world. By explaining the Presidency clearly, connecting EU benefits to everyday life, and engaging citizens through storytelling and accessible platforms, Ireland can foster pride and ownership. This approach will not only strengthen understanding of EU membership but also highlight Ireland’s leadership in shaping Europe’s future."

We have unfortunately seen a rise in far right, racist and exclusionary rhetoric, policy and practice across Europe and this is deeply concerning. Ireland has an opportunity to showcase the true, founding values of the EU – respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. This could be captured in the overarching phrase or slogan decided on by Ireland, using the language of human rights and social justice such as “Equality at the Heart of Europe’s Future”. This is in line with the actions under the first priority within the Strategic Agenda for the Union 2024-29 - a free and democratic Europe. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise the theme Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model from the 2026 Workplan of the Commission. This recognises that in recent years many Europeans, particularly those most marginalised have been impacted by the rising cost of living, the accommodation crisis, energy poverty, and divisions and inequalities in our society. The key priority must be focusing on a Europe that works for all, with equal opportunities and outcomes. Across European member states, we have witnessed a rise in tensions and divisions in communities, creating the conditions for extremists to play on people’s fears. The rights of all minority groups (including Travellers and Roma) in Europe must be at the centre of any policy plans. Currently at the EU level, there are a number of positive policy developments in progress. It is important that Ireland plays a key role in progressing key policy areas focused on human rights and social justice. For example: The new Action Plan on the Implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. The first EU Anti-Poverty Strategy The first European Affordable Housing Plan The next iteration of the EU Anti Racism Strategy Commitment to Strengthen and Invest in the Child Guarantee The consultation processes for these strategies took place in 2025 and are due for publication in 2026. Some may coincide with the Irish EU Presidency. These policies are timely and provide an opportunity to focus on the issues many families across Europe are facing every day, including poverty, homelessness, and social exclusion, with a clear impetus to address structural causes of exclusion and strengthen responses. Within this work, it is important to consider the families and communities that are most at risk of experiencing poverty, racism and barriers to realising their social rights and work to ensure that no-one is left behind. Travellers, Roma, and other minority ethnic or marginalised groups must be named within these responses, with targeted actions and resources."

The annual EU Roma Platform will be hosted by Ireland during the EU Presidency, this is an important event that focuses on the rights of Travellers and Roma across Europe. Considering the deteriorating situation for many Roma in the EU, Ireland can play a key role in calling for decisive EU action. This could build on the Commission’s 8 September 2025 acknowledgment of Roma security and protection from racist targeting as a priority concern. We are conscious that there has been recent diminishing of the Equality Portfolio at the EU level. With the publication of the next EU Anti Racism Strategy in 2026, the strategy needs adequate resources and a clear political commitment, with equality and anti-racism named and prioritised across EU and EU Commission agendas. The EU must address structural racism within institutions, criminal justice systems and public services, rather than centring focus only on individualised issues such as addressing incidents of hate speech and hate crimes. Within the 2026 Workplan, there is a Proposal for a Council Directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. This directive, first introduced in 2008, aims to extend anti-discrimination laws beyond employment to areas like housing, goods, and services and is seen as a crucial step toward closing a long-standing protection gap in EU anti-discrimination law. As a Traveller and Roma organisation, we know that people can face discrimination on multiple and intersecting grounds in all areas of life and progressing this Directive would deliver on the EU’s promises of equality and fundamental rights. Another named Directive under the theme ‘A more inclusive and protective Europe’ is extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime. ‘EU Crimes’ are a list of serious crimes with a cross-border dimension that the European Parliament and the Council may establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions. With a documented increase in hate speech and hate crimes, we would urge the Irish Government to consider how this can be progressed in 2026 to create greater protections for victims across the EU, including Ireland. We also join with our colleagues from the Irish Homeless Policy Group in calling for the Irish Presidency to table a draft Council Recommendation on ending homelessness, for adoption under the presidency in 2026. There is clear institutional momentum in the EU for a Council Recommendation on ending homelessness."

This can be mainstreamed across the workplan and all key events, ensuring all voices (especially those most marginalised are included). The Commission’s 2026 Workplan describes a “system-wide shift to managing migration”. It is imperative that migration is not treated in isolation with anti-racism efforts. The language in relation to migration is concerning, with a stronger focus on tighter controls rather than meaningful integration and inclusion, feeding into some of the current far right rhetoric. The application of the Migration Pact and associated legislation is in danger of embedding racism in EU systems, with border militarisation, severe immigration controls, and countering EU commitments to human rights and equality. This all leads to the systematic exclusion of racialised communities, migrants, and minorities. EU level oversight is needed to monitor the racialised impacts of these extreme migration policies and this work and discussions should be prioritised during the Presidency."

As highlighted in ODI’s work, Europe cannot meet its equality or economic objectives without addressing the persistent exclusion of people with disabilities from the labour market. Ireland has the largest disability employment gap in the EU, despite more than one-fifth of its population living with a disability. Closing this gap must become a central Presidency ambition. The Presidency should prioritise building a labour market where every person, including people with disabilities and those from a migrant background, can access, retain and progress in meaningful employment. ODI’s enterprise-driven model of inclusion, Social Corporate Justice, demonstrates that inclusion strengthens innovation, talent pipelines and organisational performance. Inclusive employment is not only a social imperative but an economic strategy. ODI’s Corporate Social Justice approach emphasises the responsibility of governments and employers to remove systemic barriers and embed equity into policy design. People with disabilities, migrants, and other underrepresented groups face structural challenges despite having the skills to participate fully in work and society. Ireland’s Presidency should champion EU-wide approaches that tackle discrimination, promotes reasonable accommodations and support equitable access to education, training, and employment supports. ODI partners consistently highlight the power of collaboration and partnership across public, private and civil society. Inclusive employment efforts such as placements, supported employment pathways and equitable entrepreneurship programmes demonstrate the impact of coordinated, multi-stakeholder approaches. Ireland should therefore prioritise European cohesion policies that reduce inequality between and within regions and that promote equal rights and opportunities for all citizens."

ODI’s engagement with employers and research highlight several priority areas. Disability Employment and Inclusive Labour Market Reform: Ireland should champion an EU framework that supports member states to reduce disability employment gaps through coordinated action. At EU level, Ireland can lead by proposing enhanced implementation mechanisms under Article 27 of the UNCRPD to promote inclusive employment, retention and progression. Inclusive SME Supports: ODI has developed a number of practical toolkits for inclusive recruitment, accessible job specifications and other supports for SMEs. Ireland should advocate for a coordinated SME Inclusion Support Programme to provide training, resources and advisory services Research, Data and Lived Experience Informed Policy: ODI emphasises the need for research into enterprise-level barriers to inclusive employment. Ireland should lead an EU initiative on: Standardised disability employment data collection Research on employer barriers and supports Evidence-led EU labour market inclusion strategies Cost of Disability Supports: The cost of disability is a major barrier to employment and ODI calls for a non-means-tested Cost of Disability Payment. Ireland has the opportunity to lead an EU discussion on common principles for recognising and offsetting disability-related costs.

ODI’s work shows that disabled people, migrants and individuals experencing barriers to employment often have strong skills but lack accessible pathways into work. By championing incusive employment it not only improves social mobility and economic independence for marginalised groups, it also has a positive impact on business. ODI partners repeatedly demonstrate that inclusive workplaces deliver better business performance. Disability-inclusive companies outperform peers, drive innovation and improve retention and organisational culture, Council initiatives that strengthen employer supports, such as inclusion toolkits, training and accessibility standards can enable SMEs and large employers to attract untapped talent while improving productivity and retention. When institutions deliver tangible improvements in people’s daily lives, such as accessible work, training and inclusive employer practices, public trust in the EU grows. Ensuring that the Council’s work improves quality of life, especially for under-represented groups, will reinforce EU values of equality, dignity and opportunity. Refugees and displaced people around the world remain in urgent need of support: the number of people worldwide who have been forcibly displaced is currently at an all-time high. Community Sponsorship provides a community led solution and constitutes a legal admission pathway and protection for refugees. Community Sponsorship places the responsibility of providing integration supports to refugees in the hands of local members of the community within the resettlement country. Community sponsorship creates lasting bonds between new members of the community and their neighbours. In doing so, it strengthens communities and builds awareness of broader refugee-related issues Irish communities are very well disposed to utilising this model and supporting displaced people here. This needs more Government support and increased capacity to allow more people to engage with this model and ensure better integration and engagement for people arriving in Ireland through no fault of their own. We would ask that this exemplary work be highlighted throughout the Presidency, especially as only two countries, Ireland and Brazil, are hosting small numbers of Afghans at present, despite the ongoing gender violations and violence being experienced."

Case studies from refugees, disabled people and others who might experience barriers entering employment show the EU’s values of equality, opportunity, and solidarity in action. Communication informed by lived experience is hugely impactful. Ireland should therefore centre its communications on real stories of people whose lives have improved due to EU supports as well as employers transforming workplaces with inclusive practices. To build “ownership” of the Presidency, citizens must feel involved.

In 2024 the High-Level Panels of Experts of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) report focused on “strengthening urban and peri-urban food systems” as a critical area for action as epicentres of multiple health and sustainability challenges. This focus would align with broader sustainability ambitions within the EU, specifically links between food systems, climate change, urban development and environment (European Green Deal). While rural agriculture is included in the strategic agenda (2024-2029), a thematic priority on UPU food systems could reflect a timely and forward-looking agenda for urbanisation trends and sustainability challenges. In addition to supporting the Urban Agenda for the EU Food Partnership.Which recognizes the important role urban areas play in EU sustainable and resilient futures. Food system transformation demands action beyond the dominant commercial models (Jackson et al., 2021), to include niche activities that adopt sustainability drivers, diverse business models and alternative organisational forms, such as food sharing initiatives (FSIs). FSIs support collective actions around food and food related items, operating across the food system. Food sharing involves collective actions around food between friends, families, neighbours, communities and even between strangers across the food system, from growing, to cooking and eating, surplus food redistribution and community composting. FSIs are organisations that help to facilitate diverse forms of food sharing, including sharing food itself, but also seeds, plants, food products and meals, as well as sharing spaces for growing or cooking and eating, and sharing skills and knowledge. FSIs may adopt different organisational forms, including co- operatives and social enterprises, charities and for-profits, and they can be led by grassroots, community, private sector or state actors as exemplified by seed libraries, community gardens, community supported agriculture, community kitchens, and surplus food redistribution organisations. Preliminary research has established the sustainability practices and potential of contemporary UPU FSIs (Davies, 2019) but identified challenges for FSIs related to: a lack of awareness of FSI landscapes; limited knowledge about the investments needed for, and impacts of, FSIs; policy contexts which have evolved with commercial imperatives not sustainability as key drivers; unclear pathways to expanding citizen engagement in food sharing; and a lack of collective voice for FSIs in food systems transformations. CULTIVATE (HEU innovation action grant agreement number 101083377) is addressing these challenges through the Food Sharing Compass, a compilation of new tools: the Food Sharing Map (identify, map, track and monitor FSI landscapes) , the Food Sharing Calculator (cost benefit analysis and sustainability impact assessments), the Menu of Good Governance, the Library of Citizen Engagement and the Food Sharing Community of Practice."

As a result, FSIs need to be considered when reshaping governance dynamics and developing food-related policies and programs. Policymakers will benefit from the greater understanding of the FSI landscapes, their location, and their evolution through the Food Sharing Map (2026). A comparative analysis policy brief has been produced. This has implications for a variety of policy sectors within UPU areas from parks and gardens policies to food waste reduction targets. The sustainability impacts of FSIs (see also a report on Food Sharing in Dublin) will help inform policy developments to optimise and support sustainable food sharing. CULTIVATE has also produced a policy brief which summarizes key governance barriers that currently limit the sustainability potential of FSIs and distils a suite of high-level policy recommendations to rectify this, outlined below (Herrero & Moragues-Faus, 2024): Acknowledge food sharing initiatives’ sustainability potential as enablers of healthy and sustainable food environments in official documents such the Framework for a Sustainable Food System (FSFS). Integrate regulatory policies and voluntary agreements to allow the development of wider sustainable food sharing strategies. Promote food sharing collaborations and agreements between a wide range of stakeholders including national and local governments, businesses, charities, NGOs and communities, farmers, food entrepreneurs and activists. Create synergies between different levels of food sharing governance. Empower vulnerable citizen groups (e.g., the elderly, poorer households, long-term unemployed, migrants) to participate in food sharing initiatives through job creation as well as cultural inclusion measures. Grant financial independence and budget for collaborative governance on food sharing. Consider food sharing as one of the strategic responses to health, socio-economic or climate crises and allocate resilience funds to increase their capacity to act in case of disruptive events."

Systematically mapping our food systems and food sharing landscapes is a prerequisite for establishing distributional justice around food offerings. Once the landscape is known the estimates for sustainability impact can be established and taken into consideration in planning and resource allocation decisions leading to greater recognition justice through acknowledgement of the existence and impact of, and from, food sharing initiatives. Combined, distributional and recognition justice enhance procedural justice by ensuring the voices of FSIs and those they support can be included in decision making. Such inclusion can enhance social cohesion, food security, resilience and support local economies and communities. These steps in just transitions are described in the linked papers, Geoforum and People, place and policy. By mapping food systems, enabling evidence-based support for FSIs and institutionalising participatory governance, the EU Council can help build food systems that are sustainable, equitable, resilient, locally rooted and socially inclusive. In turn delivering real, tangible benefits to people, businesses and communities across the EU."

If people aren’t involved in planning and creation, they’re much less likely to feel ownership of the outcomes. That’s why we need co-design, co-creation, consultation, and collaboration. Food sharing initiatives illustrate this well, they leverage existing local networks to transcend social barriers and bring together people from all kinds of backgrounds. We should combine bottom-up and top-down approaches and reduce fragmented efforts by ensuring strong coordination and clear communication across stakeholders.

The abstracts of some key publications are outlined below: Food sharing governance in European cities: insights from a scoping review: Food sharing initiatives (FSI) are rapidly growing in urban areas and present new opportunities to shape more sustainable urban food systems through collaborative efforts. These initiatives operate within a governance landscape that supports, influences, guides, and regulates their activities. This scoping review aims to explore the current knowledge of food sharing governance in Europe and reveal some of the governance elements that play a role in promoting or hindering the expansion of food sharing initiatives. Our research first offers a quantitative analysis of the literature, pinpointing areas for further investigation. Additionally, we provide a qualitative understanding of the benefits food sharing initiatives entail and the barriers and enablers they encounter. This comprehensive insight has led to developing a new framework to classify internal and external food sharing governance elements consisting of eight categories: structural factors, regulation, resources, discourses, relations between social actors (including power relations), participation, knowledge, and internal organisation. While avoiding idealisations and assessing these initiatives within their specific contexts is crucial, it is worth granting them visibility and support as they possess the potential to transform the food system. Evolving foodscapes: Tracing trajectories of urban and peri-urban food sharing initiatives for just food transitions: Urban and peri-urban (UPU) area food systems need reconfiguration to support just transitions towards sustainability. Collaborative acts around food – food sharing for brevity – have been mooted as a potentially productive arena for enacting such a transition, with research exploring the location, goals, and activities of individual food sharing initiatives (FSIs) internationally. Situated conceptually at the intersection of diverse economies approaches and critical mapping, with an overarching concern for achieving just transitions to sustainable food systems, this paper advances understanding of FSIs by adopting a novel longitudinal lens and focusing on the UPU scale. Implementing a co-designed and collaboratively translated system for identifying and categorizing FSIs that have a digital presence in two European cities: Milan and Barcelona, we contextualize and compare the results uncovered, contrasting these with findings from earlier research to establish evolutionary trajectories for urban FSI landscapes. The expanded mapping process offers significant empirical insights tracing the often invisible but dynamically evolving location, form, and function of UPU FSI landscapes. These methodological and empirical insights are interrogated to identify what contribution critical mapping of FSIs at the UPU scale makes to allied efforts for just and sustainable food systems. In conclusion, while the approach outlined has limitations in terms of resource intensity and explanatory power, we see the approach as one vital component in furthering comprehensive understanding of UPU food systems, providing opportunities to: document diverse food geographies; create new spatial imaginaries; support efforts for greater food democracy, and advocate for more equitable distribution of sustainable food sharing initiatives."

This priority is especially timely given the Danish Presidency of the Council of the EU (July–December 2025), placed strong, independent, and trustworthy media at the centre of its democratic, security, competitiveness and cultural agenda. The Danish Presidency’s focus on leveraging media, culture, and European content to counter disinformation and foreign interference aligns closely with Ireland’s own strengths and ambitions in this area. Ireland enters this conversation from a position of democratic credibility. We consistently rank among the top countries in the World Press Freedom Index, reflecting a long-standing commitment to protecting independent journalism and media plurality Moreover, international monitoring shows that press freedom is not just a pillar of democracy, it is a measure of its vitality. A recent Reuters Digital News Reports show that Ireland enjoys some of the highest levels of trust in news across Europe. These strengths demonstrate that when independent journalism is protected and media systems are transparent and diverse, public trust naturally follows. Ireland’s experience can therefore serve as a practical model in shaping EU-level measures to strengthen the wider information ecosystem. The case for prioritising this area is further strengthened by compelling audience insights. According to research from Kantar Media, 80% of Irish people read a print or digital news brand every week - an exceptional level of mass reach by any international standard. This demonstrates both the vibrancy of Ireland’s news ecosystem and the extent to which reliable news remains central to public life. Among younger audiences, trust is equally strong. A recent study by NewsBrands and ColourText focusing on 16–30-year-olds found that Irish news brands are the most trusted source of information and the go-to destination for verifying stories. Notably, 78% of respondents said they are concerned about fake news on social media, and a majority (57%) reported that they would turn first to established Irish news brands to verify something they saw on those platforms. These insights highlight a critical opportunity: young people value trustworthy journalism, but they need better protection and support to navigate increasingly complex digital information environments. At the core of this priority is the protection and promotion of independent, high-quality journalism as a cornerstone of democratic life. Trusted journalism ensures citizens can access accurate information, participate meaningfully in public debate, and hold public and private power to account. In an era where mis- and disinformation proliferate through digital platforms, algorithmic feeds, and AI-generated content, safeguarding the visibility and viability of reliable news and trusted sources of information is essential. Democracies cannot function without a shared factual foundation. We also recommend prioritising the digital resilience of citizens, particularly children and young people, who increasingly encounter news online, where false or manipulated content can erode trust in institutions and cause serious harm. Strengthening platform accountability, improving safety standards, and ensuring comprehensive media literacy education will help young people recognise misinformation, understand how algorithms and AI shape what they see, and appreciate the role of trusted, editorially responsible journalism. To support this broader goal, the EU must adopt legislative measures that foster a diverse, independent, and financially sustainable media sector. Ireland’s own mix of public service broadcasting, national and regional journalism, and independent digital outlets demonstrates the value of pluralism. Modern regulation should ensure fair value exchange between platforms, AI systems, and publishers, recognising the significant public value produced by journalism. Fair compensation, whether for linking, aggregation, or AI training, is essential to sustaining quality reporting and newsroom jobs. Taken together, this thematic priority supports a resilient, well-informed European public, protects young people, sustains diverse media, and reinforces democratic confidence. Ireland is uniquely positioned to lead this effort."
360,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/c16e2462/NewsBrands_Ireland_-_Submission_360.docx,NewsBrands Ireland,Trade association,Media/News publishing,National and EU,2,"The Irish Presidency should prioritise strengthening democratic resilience by supporting a strong, independent, and pluralistic media sector. The current Programme for Government commits to “a strong, independent media sector that provides essential public service broadcasting, supports local journalism, and upholds press freedom,” noting that “a well-resourced, transparent, and accountable media landscape is fundamental to an informed society and democracy” and pledging to “support efforts to ensure that national and local media are paid properly for their news content when it is used by online platforms.” These commitments provide a clear mandate for Ireland to champion media-related policies at the EU level and to bring an Irish perspective to EU discussions on democratic resilience and information integrity. As An Taoiseach highlighted on World Press Freedom Day 2025, Ireland has a “long tradition of trusted reporting, a cornerstone of our democracy that has helped shape society and protect our values. But today that trust is under extraordinary strain across the world. Misinformation, deepfakes, and mistruths make it hard to know what’s real and what’s designed to deceive. Around the world we see the destruction of truth weaponised for political ends, with grave results.” This statement underscores the urgency of ensuring that independent journalism remains financially and editorially sustainable in the face of evolving technological and economic pressures. The Strategic Agenda for the Union 2024–2029 reinforces this approach, highlighting the importance of strengthening democratic resilience, protecting free and pluralistic media, and supporting civil society. Ireland, together with thirty other countries, recently signed a declaration that “culture, cultural heritage and media policies must be a vital part of the European collaboration and European security in order to protect our democracies.” The declaration recognizes the need to guarantee citizens’ access to trustworthy news media and equip them with the digital skills needed to navigate a digitized information landscape. Measures such as the European Democracy Shield should be leveraged to strengthen resilience including promoting media literacy, reinforcing a robust framework for free and trusted media, and ensuring major technology platforms fulfil their responsibilities. These actions are critical not only for countering misinformation but also for protecting children, young people, and the wider public online. The Presidency should prioritise fair and transparent conditions for independent, pluralistic, and editorially accountable media. EU regulatory frameworks, including the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and the Copyright Directive, must be updated to reflect the realities of today’s digital and AI-driven media environment. Copyright law must evolve to maintain clear rules and a fair, efficient market that encourages innovation while protecting publishers’ investment in journalism. While Artificial Intelligence offers opportunities for creative content generation, it also poses existential risks. Uncompensated use of copyrighted content by platforms to train AI threatens the viability of trusted journalism, undermining the foundation that supports quality reporting and democratic values. The EU needs to use AI wisely. The increasing global reliance on a few AI products and services affect our cultural diversity and linguistic, press freedom and media plurality. This can marginalise local voices, languages, and perspectives. As Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, said when the European Commission announced the opening of a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Google has breached EU Competition rules by using the content of web publishers for AI purposes: “a free and democratic society depends on diverse media, open access to information, and a vibrant creative landscape. These values are central to who we are as Europeans. AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies. This is why we are investigating whether Google may have imposed unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, while placing rival AI models developers at a disadvantage, in breach of EU competition rules. “ The Irish Presidency should lead EU discussions to ensure that AI supports, rather than erodes, independent media and democratic information systems. By reinforcing press freedom, media pluralism, sustainable funding, digital literacy, and effective regulation, Ireland can safeguard democratic institutions, protect citizens from misinformation, and ensure that trusted journalism continues to underpin an informed and resilient European public."

We believe it is particularly important to direct communications at young people, who are most vulnerable to disinformation, misinformation and algorithmic and AI distortion. One of the most effective ways to build this sense of engagement is to involve young people directly in telling the story of what the EU means to them. We recommend a nationwide second level schools campaign inviting students to express their understanding of Europe through a medium of their choice - journalistic articles, videos or podcasts. Framing the EU through personal creativity helps students connect European values to issues that matter in their own lives: climate action, education opportunities, housing, diversity, security and defence, and digital safety. As part of this initiative, NewsBrands Ireland will run a dedicated journalism competition on the theme of EU citizenship, complementing its long-running Young Journalist news literacy and student journalism programme. This programme already engages approximately 10,000 secondary school students every year, equipping them with the skills to analyse media, understand credible sources, and practise responsible journalism. Integrating an EU-focused competition into this existing national framework ensures wide reach, strong participation, and high educational value. Through this process, students will be encouraged to research and report on how the EU shapes their local communities, families, and future prospects. Whether exploring EU-funded projects in their area, opportunities such as Erasmus+, or the wider benefits of membership, students will gain a deeper appreciation of the EU’s tangible impact. They will also have the opportunity to write features, interviews, or opinion pieces about the EU, using the news literacy tools embedded in the programme to fact-check sources, verify claims, and reflect on how trustworthy information supports healthy democracy. A campaign of this kind not only strengthens media literacy but also reinforces the values of citizenship, participation, and democratic engagement - core principles of the EU itself. By empowering students to become storytellers and critical thinkers, Ireland can spark broader conversations in families, schools, and communities about the importance of EU membership. Beyond schools, the content created - articles, videos, podcasts, and artwork - can be showcased during Ireland’s Presidency at national events, online platforms, regional exhibitions, and through news media outlets. Highlighting young people’s perspectives will help create a shared narrative of ownership: the Presidency is not just a governmental milestone, but a national moment in which every citizen has a role."

This is analogous to the prioritisation by the Irish Presidency, in January 1990 – June 1990 under Taoiseach Haughey, of the reunification of Germany. “Advancing Europe’s Social Democracy” should be one of the two key themes. We should re-ignite the social defence of Europe, in the spirit of Jacques Delors’ famed “social chapter”, as a counterpoint from a neutral member state (which will be welcomed by EU citizens across Europe) to the emphasis by some other member states on military defence. Within that, Ireland should initiate a strategic goal for Europe to create a socio-political reserve within the European treaty framework, to be called the European Social Space (the German equivalent “Europäische Sozialbereich” would be a more accurate descriptor – why not use this?). All European national governments should be free to declare essentials for society as economically reserved into the European Social Space, and the European Union as a whole may also make such directives. It is envisaged that sectors such as housing, healthcare provisions, transport, food provision and so on will be reserved into the European Social Space. Such reserved sectors within the European Social Space will be in a safe harbour of protection from free market forces. Democratically elected centre-left or left governments in EU countries will be empowered to implement their programmes within the European Social Space, without the current interferences of free-market oriented rules. The parts of the economy that belong in the marketplace, outside the European Social Space, will be subject to free market rules, but the parts of the economy that are the essentials of living, what is “zuhaus”, “at home”, to use another German expression, will be governed by economic rules giving priority to society and people over the demands of capitalism. The principle will be to go back to the basic economics of why markets arose, and what they are for – surpluses to the essentials of human subsistence. As one of the other priorities in unpacking the European Social Space, the EU needs to initiate a dirigiste programme, using the Airbus Industrie model as a successful template, to create European scale alternatives to the major data, commercial and banking hyperscale companies to counter US dominance, to assert European sovereignty as a means to the end of defending Europe socially."

Initiation of a global EU political strategy to educate electorates in non-EU countries, especially in the USA, of the advantages and benefits of social democracy, with a view to effecting a decisive redirection of US politics to a position on the economic left of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal policies, and advancing and supporting the emergence of strong social democratic regimes throughout the Americas. Revive the seminal idea of a European Economic Community as a template for concerted action by Europe to develop strategic hyperscale goods and services conglomerates to challenge US and Chinese hyperscale domination in social media, semiconductors, financial services and other sectors in which Europe does not lead.

Legislative Proposals The Irish Presidency must lead on initiating EU legislation to establish the framework for a European Social Space within the Union, a socio-economic safe harbour for key strategic essential sectors of European or national social necessity within which the EU or national governments may place essential sectors (housing, basic income, social need, health, education, public transport, climate defence measures) such that they are protected from neo-conservative concepts of “free enterprise”.

It must tack left in economic terms, and start to lead Europe back to the basics of the social contract and the economic aspects of social democracy that have been watered down over the past fifty or so years. It is time to decisively reject the corrosive effects of neo-conservative economics on the EU and its peoples. The continued drift from social democracy and social protection, and the allied lack of sufficient investment in social essentials over recent decades are the root causes of what is alienating ordinary people of limited means from the European project and is driving them into the hands of the far right. The European project is a social democratic project, and can never be any other. The EU is increasingly seen as having hard-wired free enterprise into its treaties, and is, rightly or wrongly, seen as frustrating the implementation of social democratic policies (often by national governments unwilling to implement declared social democratic policies by hiding behind over-zealous interpretations of EU law). Current treaties such as CETA and Mercosur with their subversive investor-state courts further erode European democracy and sovereignty, rendering elected social democratic governments impotent, and leading to electoral alienation. Not just the perception of that must change, but also must the realities. The “bridges too far”, both at national and European level, must be revisited and reversed. A national example of a “bridge too far” is the German “Hartz IV” measure, and similar provisions in other countries. Likewise, flat single rate non-progressive income tax has no place in a social democratic EU. Neither have EU level measures, such as, for example, the infamous Bolkestein directive allowing multinational enterprises to take advantage of the lowest social protection national regime of labour laws. The selective citation of the Draghi report to support “less government”, “less regulation” ideologies of the right needs to be countered by a Presidency steering Draghi onto its true course of a call to action by Europe, which will actually need to be more dirigiste in nature, to marshal the diverse and predominantly small enterprises of Europe to create hyper-scale organised competition to the over-dominant US and Chinese hyperscale companies in many sectors. Draghi must be tempered also by a greater invocation of the Letta Report, which takes also a social viewpoint. Even Letta’s report is weak in this respect. The Irish Presidency needs to commission a major figure of the European centre-left (any of Frans Timmermans who has a recent Commission and national experience, or Andrea Nahles, author of “Frau, gläubig, links – Was mir wichtig ist”, or Peer Steinbruck, author of “Das Elend der Sozialdemokratie”, or Martine Aubry, Mayor of Lille would be good candidates) and give that person a brief to honestly report on the alienation of the European citizen from the social-democratic perspective and to draft a similarly seminal report with a great call to action to re-centre the EU to its natural left of centre position."

It should start a social democratic crusade and openly challenge the US Trump regime. The EU also needs to actively work to spread European social democratic values inside the US electorate to counter what Trump is doing in Europe. Ireland’s Presidency needs to work in harmony with the clearly expressed political directions of the large majority of its citizens, perhaps as most recently expressed at the ballot box in the sense of Irish reunification, progressive socio-economic democracy, and a Europe which needs to urgently redirect its external policies to be a consistently moral beacon of international human rights and order. I emphasise “in harmony”. The Irish Presidency cannot be used to advance positions (openly or by nuance) which fly in the face of the large majority of its own citizens. The people of Ireland expect a Presidency which will lead in the political direction set out above. So do many tens of millions of EU citizens in all of the 26 other EU Member States, some of whom may despair of the directions of their own governments and who would look to Ireland to advance what they believe in accord with the majority in Ireland. A Presidency which tries to actively advance EU positions against a large majority of its own citizens, expressed at the ballot box, for example with respect to weakening Irish neutrality, or EU social democracy, or GDPR, or agriculture protections, or advocating positions against these, would be fatally flawed and alienate citizens. There is a second choice: a do-nothing, say-nothing, propose-nothing, initiate-nothing, don’t-speak-out-of-turn, don’t-rock-the-boat, indecisive, dithering, lacklustre and mediocre presidency, which would be a failure of leadership. That would be a wasted opportunity. There is only one option for success, which is the third choice: an Irish Presidency which leads in new directions in harmony with the people of Ireland and where we (and vast numbers of EU citizens, often who are disengaged today) want to see the EU go. For example, an Irish Presidency which set in train a “Timmermans Report” or a “Nahles Report”, a new Social Chapter, and the European Social Space would make an impact that would last a decade and would reshape the EU for the better. Never mind that the fruits would come in successive presidencies, Ireland would have led. Only in the context of such a presidency will Irish citizens engage, be enthused and energised, and own a democratic Irish Presidency which is “by them, of them and for them”. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU cannot become the plaything of an elite, perceived or otherwise, which wants to push a solely EPP oriented direction, this direction having been so decisively rejected at the ballot box recently. The use of Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU for promotion and planning for Irish reunification would be an excellent way to create a sense of ownership, amongst citizens, over Ireland’s Presidency."

The modernisation of EU patent rules, especially the patent enforcement framework, would directly support key objectives of the Strategic Agenda in the following ways: Competitiveness and innovation: The modernisation of patent rules would contribute to making business easier and faster in Europe and ensure companies here can perform well and compete on a level playing field. Boosting productivity through digital technology diffusion: Under the current patent enforcement framework, companies hesitate to adopt AI systems, IoT solutions, or advanced semiconductors when a single patent dispute could halt operations. Completing the Single Market: Fragmented national approaches to enforcement of patents enable forum shopping and undermine the Single Market. EU-level modernisation of the patent enforcement framework would ensure consistency across Member States. Cutting red tape and simplifying business: The current unpredictable patent enforcement framework forces companies to expend enormous resources navigating legal risks rather than innovating. Put in place more than two decades ago, it is not fit for the digital age. Its modernisation is needed to create predictable outcomes, reduce the administrative burden of defensive patent strategies, and ultimately support investment in productive R&D rather than litigation and excessive settlements. Supporting SMEs and midcaps: Small innovative companies are most vulnerable to abusive litigation. They need a system that does not allow patent assertion entities to extract disproportionate settlements through the threat of business-ending injunctions. Economic security and strategic autonomy: Critical technology sectors - semiconductors, AI, quantum - are at the highest risk of abusive patent litigation because of their complexity. A balanced patent system would ensure Europe can lead in these strategic technologies that underpin its resilience and sovereignty."

It allows for products – even complex products with thousands of components – to be removed from the market in their entirety when even a single component-related patent is infringed. While the IPRED does call for proportionate remedies, it needs to be modernised to make clear when an alternative to outright product removal would be the most appropriate remedy for infringement. Because of this lack of clarity about how proportionality should be applied, injunctions resulting in product removals have been granted almost automatically in all patent cases since the IPRED was adopted in 2004. This situation has been compounded by the fact that the IPRED has not been given proper effect in most Member States. This harmful dynamic could be resolved by modernising the IPRED to specify when courts should be required to consider alternative remedies to removing product lines from the market in patent suits. IP2Innovate’s members own 484,000 patents and published applications worldwide. Modernising the IPRED is not about weakening intellectual property rights or undermining IP valorisation – it is about ensuring patent enforcement works properly in the digital age so that remedies reflect the real harm caused and do not unintentionally block innovation or investment. A more balanced and predictable patent enforcement framework will help Europe compete globally, attract investment, support its industrial base, and ensure that those who genuinely innovate can thrive. As part of improving proportionality, the EU should also consider measures to increase transparency around the publication of judicial rulings and decisions, as well as the role of patent assertion entities and litigation financing and control. We support greater transparency in patent disputes - in national courts and the UPC - as well as more broadly, and hope that ongoing EU level examination of disclosure and accountability in litigation funding will result in clearer and more balanced litigation practices overall."

It is essential for the creative industries that the EU’s legal and policy framework remains robust and fit for purpose and continues to protect and nurture human artistry. Creative industries, and particularly the recorded music industry, have embraced digital innovation and technological change and recognise that the responsible use of technology and AI have a crucial role in fostering the development of smart knowledge-based economies. Technological development should evolve with, and not at the expense of, the cultural and creative sectors. IRMA hopes that the Irish Presidency will foster the responsible use of the output of the creative industries. A strong copyright framework that protects creators’ rights is not a regulatory burden but an investment in Europe’s economy and competitiveness. We hope that the Presidency will: Promote a legal and commercial landscape in the EU that fully respects the principles of freedom of contract, freedom to conduct business, respect for intellectual property and fair competition. Ensure that the existing EU rules are fully implemented and enforced in a meaningful manner."

The Presidency could facilitate a technical and in-depth exchange of views among Member States in the Council, based on economic data and stakeholder consultations on the various topics under review. It would be beneficial to provide opportunities for policymakers and stakeholders to express their positions in dedicated fora, for instance, during Presidency conferences. From IRMA’s viewpoint it is hoped that freedom of contract and the protection of exclusive rights will remain intact. Artificial Intelligence On the subject of AI and copyright, the Irish Presidency could continue requesting that the European Commission, in particular its AI Board and the AI Office, provide regular feedback on the application of the AI implementation package, namely the GPAI Code of Practice and Transparency Template. This is to allow Member States to follow the process closely and ensure that the intention of the co-legislators regarding the transparency and copyright compliance provisions is fully met. Telecommunications With respect to the Digital Omnibus package, it is hoped that Ireland will ensure that the simplification of EU digital rules does not modify the core provisions of the AI Act and other core EU acts, such as the GDPR. Where there are divergences among Member States, Ireland is in a strong position to balance these pressures, given the concentration of technology platforms residing here side by side with a prolific cultural sector. We suggest that there should be a focus on the meaningful application of existing rules rather than pushing for new legislation prematurely."

In practical terms for the cultural sector, this means: The implementation of the existing EU legislative framework, including in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Intellectual Property. Evidence-based policy making, based on robust economic data, in full consultation with all relevant stakeholders. A fair and competitive market based on legal certainly fosters an environment that encourages investments in both the creative sector and in new technologies. This ultimately benefits end users and consumers. Encouraging discussion on how to harness the existing tools to continue combating infringements of intellectual property rights. This must also include new challenges such as streaming fraud, which are not only detrimental to artists and the entire music ecosystem but can also engender mistrust in new technologies among audiences. It is to be hoped that in weighing its priorities, the Presidency maintains a human-centred focus during discussions on technology and innovation. Technological advancement is something to be embraced, and in doing so, legislative advancement will hopefully enhance protections for the cultural and creative sectors. The most effective means to achieve this is to maintain provisions that are currently functioning well, such as freedom of contract. It vital to the Irish recorded music industry that the Irish Presidency ensures that the EU’s institutions implement the AI Act’s copyright rules in a meaningful way, and resists moves to dilute these as part of the Digital Omnibus package. The Irish Recorded Music Association is keen to be a constructive and positive partner in this process, and we are more than willing to provide our perspective and insights during any consultations and events which take place during the Presidency."

The Irish Presidency is well placed to draw on this legacy and demonstrate the EU’s track record of improving citizens’ quality of life. This goes far beyond economic advancement to include the protection of democracy and civil rights, and the advancement of the cultural realm. The Irish Presidency can communicate that the EU is a safe haven for sensible regulation that protects citizens’ rights. We see this in existing initiatives such as the European Democracy Shield, an effort to empower, protect, and promote strong and resilient democracies. The EU should also remain a safe haven for the protection of cultural output from piracy and unfair use. We have seen recent incidents where deepfake videos were used in an effort to disrupt the Irish Presidential election, and the potential for this to have a detrimental impact on democratic participation and trust in media. This is a challenge already faced by creators and rightsholders, as underregulated technological developments threaten to undermine their copyrighted creative works. The existing threats to cultural output provide a harbinger for political risk across our institutions. At a more prosaic level, the European Union has an opportunity to revitalise music education as a means to sustain cohesive societies and creative economies. Initiatives such as Erasmus+ offer platforms to increase and improve cultural exchange to further enhance our mutual understanding. In addition, we suggest that, throughout the Presidency, the Irish government could encourage civil society participation wherever possible, in order to create a sense of ownership amongst citizens. Again, this is an area where the Irish Recorded Music Association is keen to be a constructive and active participant in civil society initiatives organised during the Presidency."

It is an opportunity to promote Irish interests abroad, and to attract investment. The opportunity must not be wasted. The Presidency takes place as a referendum on Irish Unity approaches and ten years after the Brexit vote which dragged the north of our country out of the EU despite the people there voting strongly to remain. The Presidency will also happen at a time of much global uncertainty and as the EU strays ever further from the vision of peaceful cooperation it likes to project. The Irish Presidency must not be used as a hiding place from the big issues of the day, it should not be passive Presidency focussed on creating a distraction from its own mess at home and deflecting all criticism under the pretence of protecting the country’s image in front of the world’s cameras. Instead, Sinn Féin is calling for an active ambitious and assertive EU Presidency where the country leaves a positive mark on the EU and its priorities. Some of the key thematic issues Ireland should prioritise Irish Unity, welcoming back the island of Ireland into the EU Promotion of Peace The cost-of-living crisis and energy costs for workers and families Protecting Workers’ Rights and the Environment in a time of change Overseas Development Fair play for Farmers and the Fishing Industry Irish Unity, welcoming back the island of Ireland into the EU The Irish Presidency comes at a critical time for the future of our country. It will be ten years since the North voted to remain in the European Union with the rest of Ireland and rejected Brexit. Yet the British government chose to ignore the clear democratic will of the people and without consent forcibly removed the North from the EU in January 2020. Years of tortured negotiations needed up a with Special Status for the north and a 2017 EU Council confirmation that if and when the people of Ireland, North and South, vote for reunification – as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement – the North will automatically rejoin the European Union as part of a United Ireland. The preparation for this referendum must start in earnest during the Irish Presidency. The reunification of our country must be woven into the logic and actions of the entire Presidency. A majority of people believe their long-term future would be best served by rejoining the European Union. There exists a democratic deficit as a result of Brexit and there is an onus on the Irish Government to help rectify this. Irish citizens in the North are also EU citizens by law, and the government and the EU must give voice to them. Irish MEPs in a recent letter to the President of the European Parliament called for observer status in the European Parliament for our locally elected political representatives - a policy Sinn Féin has been advocating since 2017. An Amárach Research poll for the European Movement Ireland, published in May 2035 found that a majority of people in both parts of Ireland – 67% in the North and 62% in the South – now support a United Ireland within the EU.It confirms that people want change, and they want a future back in the European Union. These figures reflect a growing understanding that the cost of Brexit – economically, politically, and socially – has been detrimental for the North of Ireland. The same poll shows that 60% of people in the North do not believe that our relationship has improved since Brexit with the EU. Only 29% think otherwise. This is a stark indictment of a process that was imposed upon our people against their democratic consent. The European Council’s 2017 statement in the context of Brexit stated that in the event of a united Ireland the state will automatically be within the EU. The Harvey-Bassett report assesses that reunification would be viewed as a territorial extension of an existing EU Member State (Ireland), and No Article 49 EU accession process is needed. A smooth and legitimate process will require coordinated planning across jurisdictions, deep civic engagement, and active EU support. It is essential that the groundwork begins now to avoid uncertainty and ensure a peaceful, democratic transition to a united Ireland within the European Union. The North of Ireland has been held back for too long by partition. The Irish Government must now take up its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement, step forward, and begin the necessary planning. That means convening a Citizens’ Assembly and preparing for constitutional change in a way that is inclusive, respectful and forward-looking. Promotion of Peace The EU has lost immense credibility among the Irish people and more broadly across the EU for its political support of the genocidal Israeli regime’s actions during its war on the people of Gaza. It has proven a dark chapter for the EU. Despite the ceasefire agreement, people are still being killed in their hundreds, and the ongoing pursuit of settlements undermines the potential for a two-state solution. Similarly, the EU has failed to adequately pressure the UAE for its role in fuelling conflict in Sudan. The Irish government must take initiatives that attempt to reposition the EU and restore its credibility and promote a role for the EU as a supporter of peace and democracy, in Palestine, in Sudan, in Ukraine, and other conflicts across the world. The cost of living crisis and energy costs for workers and families It is crucial that the energy market and the nature of it is restructured. Since 2018, residential electricity prices have more than double. Irish households should not have to pay the highest prices in Europe indefinitely. Energy prices have fallen much more slowly here than other EU countries. And the gap between retail and wholesale prices is the highest in the world. This situation in Ireland and indeed across many other member states needs to be taken seriously and get this issue under control. Protecting Workers’ Rights and the Environment in a time of change The EU has shifted into an agenda that is anti-workers’ rights and has proposed measures that will impact negatively on the environment all in the name of competition or deregulation. The Irish Presidency should draw a line in the sand on such proposals and instead refocus on tackling the cost of living in a real way while protecting workers and the environment. It must act as a rallying call for a social Europe and push for a 180 degree turn on workers’ rights and the deregulation agenda. Overseas Development The worrying reality is that millions of people in the developing world have seen life saving projects defunded due to cuts in overseas development aid in the US as well as various European countries. Ireland should show leadership in ensuring this tide is turned around, but also in exploring other mechanisms, including examination of Debt restructuring Fair play for Farmers and the Fishing Industry We must ensure that farmers and fishers have an adequate income and food security. We must promote these industries and encourage our young people to pursue careers in these areas. These must be a viable and practical way to earn a living in Ireland. It is crucial that our farms remain family run and that our fishing industries remain family run also. That these sectors continue to be centered around the family farm and the family business."

The Global Europe regulation statement that was discussed at the Foreign Affairs committee on 25th November 2025, was extremely general and lacked any great detail. In effect it purports to be an instrument of foreign policy of the EU. We in Sinn Féin believe that it is very important that Ireland and every member state retains its own independent foreign policy. The Global Europe regulation must also reflect on how the crisis in ODA can be addressed. We need to see further detail on this, and we need to have clear guidelines on what is the timescale for the further development of this and what this will mean in practical terms. There is much commentary on investment in European security and respect for neutrality. This implies that this measure could involve military expenditure of some shape or form. From Sinn Féin's point of view, we are very clear that there is a need for investment in our Defence Forces but that should be a decision taken by an Irish Government independently and according to our own needs and priorities. We would have a watchful eye on any regulations that have military dimensions in terms of expenditure. With regards Irish Unity, we propose calling a High-Level EU Summit to advance preparations for re-unification and laying out the practicalities agreement at Council level as to how many extra MEPs, votes at Council level a United Ireland would be entitled to and other legal issues that unity would bring ensuring full a participation of the Assembly and Executive in the Presidency’s activities including meetings across the Six Counties. including Six County representation and input in all cultural events linked to the Presidency With regards Peace, in Palestine, in Sudan, and Ukraine, we propose proposing an EU initiative to recognise the State of Palestine during the Presidency pushing for EU payments to the Palestinian Authority to be advanced in light of the dire economic situation in the West Bank and for the Palestinian tax revenues being held by Israel to be released proposing an EU-wide ban on settlement goods and services, mirroring Ireland’s own Occupied Territories Bill working to deliver a full suite of sanctions on the Israeli state, mirroring those rightfully imposed on Russia working to deliver a full suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement working to deliver an EU-wide arms embargo on Israel working to ensure that Israel are excluded from Horizon Europe and its successor programmes and that no Israeli companies can benefit financially from the European Defence Fund more effective pressure on the UAE and other states and parties who fuel the conflict in Sudan by continuing to flood it with large scale and sophisticated weapons continued pressure by political, diplomatic and economic means on Russia to halt its illegal occupation of Ukraine a meeting of the UN Secretary General and top EU officials in Ireland marking the importance of the United Nations in peace building and conflict resolution a major domestic event showcasing Irish neutrality and the achievements of Ireland’s peacekeepers through the decades an event marking Ireland’s role in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the ongoing importance of adherence to the Treaty On workers rights and the Environment host a conference of social actors like Trade Unions, Women’s Rights groups and Human Rights Organisations to set out a new social course for the EU insist on a social and environmental check on all legislation being discussed during the Presidency to ensure it does not allow backwards movement on workers’ rights or environment standards champion workers’ rights legislation that was promised by the Commission (right to disconnect/implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights) finalisation of a new PeacePlus programme focussed on removing the traumas and economic and social imbalances caused by partition"

There is a feeling that these institutions do not respect the real need for subsidiarity, national legislatures and that they do not respect the need for decisions to be taken at a local level. This is an opportunity for Ireland to play a leading role in these European institutions in reasserting its respect for the individual sovereignty of member states and for decisions to be made at a local and domestic level. This should be a presidency that communicates to the people of Europe that there is respect for all countries, for their domestic legislatures and their sovereignty, and that mutual cooperation works best when members states can feel confident in their own independence as national states Sinn Féin believe in being strong on neutrality and strong on defense. We anticipate and appreciate that there will likely be discussion around military expenditure and Defence spending, and we are clear that each member state should have the right to decide themselves what their priorities should be in relation to Defence spending. It is crucial that each member state retains and has control over their sovereignty, independence and subsidiarity. While we respect the rights of sovereign states to take such decisions, to spend on defence and enter into military alliances - indeed we ourselves believe considerable investment is needed in our Defence Forces, that this is necessary. However, the EU was not imagined as a military alliance and it should not double as one - In recent times, the lines between NATO meetings and EU meetings have become blurred. Ireland’s Presidency must put clear waters between the two and no NATO discussion or side meetings should happen in our country. It is important that there is respect for Irish neutrality and the neutrality of other members states in relation to this."

However, concerns have been raised in recent weeks among Irish and European military leaders in relation to Ireland’s ability to resource security operations during the upcoming EU Presidency. This is completely and utterly down to this Government and its predecessors and how they have completely neglected our Defence Forces. They have allowed the Defence Forces to become depleted. It is a cause of great concern and regret that the Government has left us in this vulnerable position and that events around the EU Presidency could be exposed due to a lack of capability, particularly in relation to tackling drones but also our ability to monitor and police our own waters. This should hopefully be a lesson to our Government and should encourage them to finally take our Defence Forces seriously. Sinn Féin are very concerned by the significant crisis that is being caused by the huge cut in USAID. Whether anyone can fill the gap is a question. One of the proposals being explored by development organisations is the issue of debt held by Third World countries and the restructuring of that debt. This needs to be discussed at an EU level and it should be an element of the discussion that Ireland will be looking at as part of its Presidency. We believe also that there must be a discussion around the EU and a reevaluation of this. Recent comments from senior EU leaders would make it appear that the EU is imagined now as a military organization. This is not the case and indeed ca never be the case. This rhetoric needs to be challenged and Ireland as a sovereign and neutral country that promotes peace building should play its role in that. The EU should not be requiring particular actions of member states that would compromise neutrality. It must respect the sovereignty and national independence of each member state. Gaeilge The Presidency must be proudly bi-lingual and not slip into being a monolinguistic Presidency i.e. English only. The Presidency must also mark the end once and for all of the technical derogation on Irish interpretation, currently in place, as this limits the rights of Irish speakers in the EU for Irish at EU level. EU Budget While there be a multitude of legislative files to be dealt with the sign-off on the MFF (EU Budget) will be most important. The government must ensure that a fair Budget that protects farmers, workers and the environment is achieved. NATO ban In recent times, the lines between NATO meetings and EU meetings have become blurred. Ireland’s Presidency must put clear waters between the two and no NATO discussion or side meetings should happen in our country. Corporate sponsors The Presidency should avoid corporate sponsorship. If the government insists it is necessary, all sponsors must be ethically cleared meaning no fossil fuel companies or companies implicated in the occupation of Palestinian territory for example. An Anti-Partitionist Presidency An anti-partitionist image in all cultural and political events. Token inclusion of six county people or politicians in events or cultural exhibitions is not sufficient. From day one the Council Presidency must be visibly and unambiguously anti-partitionist in its presentation and content. Conclusion: A “do-nothing, say nothing” EU Presidency suits only the pollical establishment at home and in Brussels. Simply being competent chairpersons is not what the Irish people want or deserve. Failing to champion Irish Unity during the six months Ireland holds the Presidency would be an abdication of leadership in our efforts to unify our country. Those who say they support Irish Unity must act to do so during the six months. We fully respect the workload Irish civil servants and others will come under during this period as literally hundreds of meetings fall under Ireland’s role as chair. The technical and administrative role as well as policing and other costs cannot be neglected and must be fully resourced. Sinn Féin has engaged with and will continue to respond to Ministers as they seek input on priorities in specific areas of policy. The nitty-gritty of the Presidency is in files and negotiation rooms but that is not all the Presidency is or should be. This must be a political Presidency- one that is distinctively and proudly Irish and pro-Irish interests, an active and assertive period of Irish leadership for the European Union."

With rising housing costs and growing rates of homelessness and persistent poverty across the EU, Ireland is well positioned to champion a Presidency grounded in the EU values of dignity, equality, and human rights. A central thematic priority should be delivering a coordinated European approach to housing, grounded in the commitment by all 27 Member States to work towards ending homelessness by 2030 as part of the Lisbon Declaration, and aligned with the forthcoming European Affordable Housing Plan. This must include a clear recognition that housing is first and foremost a home - as opposed to a financial asset - and that secure, affordable homes are the foundation of wellbeing and thriving communities. Addressing poverty more broadly must also form a key pillar of the Presidency, the Irish Presidency should identify, progress, and monitor measures to ensure the effective implementation of the new EU Anti-Poverty Strategy currently being developed. This should be done through effective collaboration with organisations representing the diversity of experience of poverty and social exclusion, and co-creation with those with lived experience.

In particular, the Simon Communities of Ireland are calling for the Irish Presidency to table a draft Council Recommendation on ending homelessness, for adoption under the presidency in 2026. There is clear institutional momentum in the EU for a Council Recommendation on ending homelessness. In February 2024, the Belgian Presidency held a Ministerial Conference on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH). The event was an opportunity to discuss efforts to eradicate homelessness in the EU by 2030, a commitment all 27 EU countries agreed to work towards with the signing of the Lisbon Declaration in 2021. A report from the event noted a growing will among member states for a Council Recommendation on eradicating homelessness, recognising the urgency of coordinated EU-level action and the value of the Housing First. In an official Opinion, the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) explicitly called in 2024 for an EU homeless strategy, “underpinned by a Council Recommendation on homelessness. The EESC therefore calls on the Belgian Presidency of the EU to start work on a Recommendation” (§ 1.3). In March 2025, the European Parliament welcomed intentions for a Council Recommendation on homelessness as part of a resolution on the European Semester for Economic Policy Coordination: Employment and Social Priorities for 2025 (§16). The Council Conclusions on the future European Affordable Housing Plan, published in November 2025, proposes “stronger cooperation at EU level on homelessness, building on the work of and further strengthening the European Platform on Combating Homelessness and housing-led policies such as the Housing First Principle; and consider whether a proposal for a new Council Recommendation on ending homelessness in Europe could contribute to this end” (paragraph 37). The Committee of the Regions, in a recent Opinion on an EU Anti-Poverty Strategy, also recently called on the Council to “follow-up on the Belgian Presidency’s initiative to prepare a Council Recommendation on ending homelessness” (§ 104). The Housing Advisory Board, chaired by Eammon Ryan, recently published its recommendations to the European Commission, which included that the Commission propose, and Council adopt by 2026, a “Recommendation on Homelessness that transforms the Lisbon Declaration into a governance framework at national level and a plan for European-level action to support an monitor progress” (pg 14). Coupled with Government reiterating Ireland’s commitment to ending homelessness by 2030 in the Delivering Homes, Building Communities housing plan, Ireland is well-positioned to lead on this agenda during the presidency."

The cost of providing emergency accommodation, crisis supports, and health services for persons experiencing homelessness is substantial for Member States. Investing in prevention and permanent solutions is far more sustainable and cost-effective. Experiencing homelessness can have multiple negative impacts, including adverse effects on physical health, mental health, and overall wellbeing. For children, experiencing homelessness can negatively affect development, cognitive functioning, participation in education, and opportunities later in life. By investing in early intervention, family support, and housing-led responses, Member States can prevent these long-term harms, strengthen community wellbeing, and significantly reduce public expenditure associated with emergency responses and downstream health and social services. More broadly, addressing Europe’s housing crisis would strengthen economic competitiveness, labour market functioning, and community resilience across the EU. Across many Member States, workers – especially younger people, essential workers, and those on low to moderate incomes – are increasingly priced out of renting or buying near employment hubs, undermining businesses’ ability to attract and retain staff. This reduces productivity, increases commuting pressures, and weakens social cohesion as people are pushed away from communities where they work, study, or have family ties. By supporting the implementation of the European Affordable Housing Plan and promoting accessible and affordable housing, Ireland’s Presidency can help ensure European cities and towns remain vibrant, dynamic, and economically competitive. Improving housing affordability is therefore not just a moral obligation – it is also cornerstone of a thriving economy, a stable workforce, and strong local communities. Through ambitious action on homelessness and housing, the Irish Presidency is an opportunity to deliver a tangible positive impact for people, businesses, and communities across the EU."

A 2025 poll by Statica also found that 64% of respondents viewed housing as one of the top two issues facing Ireland. Before and during the Presidency, Ireland should highlight how EU actions and policies directly impact and support affordable housing, and ending and preventing homelessness. By showing how European cooperation contributes to increased investment in sustainable and affordable homes and strengthening social rights both in Ireland and abroad, the Presidency can make the EU feel more relevant, accessible, and impactful. Central to this approach should be centring the voices of lived experience and creating meaningful platforms for to contribute to Presidency events and policy discussions – particularly for persons experiencing homelessness, migrant communities, Travellers and Roma, young persons, and disabled persons. Ensuring these groups are visible and active participants in Presidency events will both ensure effective policymaking and foster a stronger sense of ownership among communities who are often underrepresented in the decisionmaking process. Ireland should also adopt an accessible communication strategy. All Presidency communications, including digital content, publications, public events, and outreach materials, should be available in easy-to-read formats, accessible layouts, and multiple languages, including Irish Sign Language and other formats where appropriate. Communications should be designed and co-created in partnership with Disabled Persons’ Organisations, civil society groups, and representative community organisations to ensure they reflect lived realities and meet diverse accessibility needs. Finally, outreach efforts must be deliberately targeted toward communities that have historically been underrepresented in EU-level conversations, ensuring that the benefits of the Presidency are shared widely and that the Presidency itself reflects the diversity of the people it serves."

As a national NGO advocating for international students, we work at the intersection of education, mobility, immigration, and inclusion. These lived experiences offer concrete insights into how EU systems perform, and how they can be strengthened to deliver greater fairness, resilience, and public value. Based on this expertise, ICOS proposes the following three areas as strong, people-centred thematic priorities that Ireland’s Presidency could credibly lead on and contribute to broader EU objectives. 1. Inclusive Mobility for a Future-Ready Europe Learner mobility is a long-standing expression of European cooperation. When mobility systems are clear, fair, and rights-based, they deliver public value: talent development, social cohesion, and global connection. International students and researchers engage daily with EU-regulated systems, including visas, immigration registration, housing markets, and qualification recognition. Their experiences are a real-world measure of how the EU delivers. Ireland’s Presidency can: Champion transparent, timely visa and work pathways (JHA configuration) Promote fair qualification recognition and academic transitions (EYCS) Support multilingual, accessible public information on rights and redress mechanisms Mobility should not be reduced to a transactional market. It is a public good that supports inclusion, human development, and democratic participation, reflecting core EU values and aligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 and the European Education Area. 2. International Education as Strategic Public Infrastructure Ethical international education supports not only individuals, but EU-wide strategic goals: Research and innovation Climate adaptation and global cooperation Gender equality and inclusive economic development International students contribute to Europe’s demographic sustainability and are integral to its future skills ecosystem. The Presidency can: Position study and research exchange as key components of the EU’s competitiveness and talent strategy Reinforce long-term alumni networks as soft-power assets Champion education as a durable, rights-based investment in the Union’s internal strength and external partnerships (SDGs 4 and 17) 3. Safer Digital Living for Mobile Citizens International learners rely on digital platforms for accommodation, services, and community life, often across language barriers and legal systems. Yet they remain vulnerable to scams, exploitative practices, and information gaps. Ireland’s Presidency should: Promote platform accountability and digital consumer protections Advance a rights-based approach to digital services in cross-border settings Ensure that mobile learners’ lived experiences inform the broader EU digital transformation agenda These themes reflect Ireland’s capacity to convene practical, people-centred solutions across Council configurations. Learner mobility is a human measure of how EU systems work. When they reduce friction, prevent harm, and enable belonging, they also enhance Europe’s competitiveness and social resilience. This delivers benefits for individuals, institutions, and communities alike. These themes also reflect the role of civil society in strengthening EU systems and delivering public value, bridging institutions and communities at national and international levels."

This includes international students, researchers, and mobile learners across all stages of education and training. Ireland’s Presidency provides an opportunity to make progress on the systems international learners and education providers depend on, including immigration, accommodation, consumer protection, and qualification recognition. These issues cut across Council configurations, including Education, Youth, Culture and Sport, Justice and Home Affairs, and Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs. ICOS recommends a cross-cutting focus on the following, framed around values-driven governance and practical outcomes: A coherent, inclusive approach to international education EU legislation and policy should uphold the rights and welfare of all international students, across Erasmus+, national scholarships, and self-funded pathways. This includes transparent approaches to residence permits, post-study options, access to public services, and protection from discrimination. The 2026 European Commission Work Programme should prioritise inclusive mobility as a core element of EU education policy and advance practical proposals to enhance student safety and wellbeing. Fair, learner-centred migration and visa systems ICOS urges the Presidency to prioritise work within the JHA configuration to improve mobility pathways for third-country nationals, including students and researchers. Fair, efficient, and transparent visa and residency processes are central to Europe’s credibility and attractiveness as a destination for study, research, innovation, and skills development, and should be positioned as shared EU infrastructure. Such systems also underpin broader resilience and security by ensuring well-managed and rights-based migration. Protection from discrimination and exploitation Across EU Member States, international students are often vulnerable to racism, housing discrimination, precarious work, and exploitative recruitment. The Presidency should support stronger safeguards and clear redress mechanisms, ensuring that learners are treated as rights-holders, not solely as economic contributors. This includes tackling hate crime, discrimination, and extreme hate speech, in line with the EU Anti-Racism Action Plan and the Digital Services Act, aligning with EPSCO priorities around equality, social protection, and fair working conditions. Strengthening cross border education through EYCS ICOS recommends that the Presidency use the EYCS configuration to support progress on: Ethical, transparent cross-border student recruitment Qualification recognition and fair transitions between education and work High-quality learner supports and wellbeing systems These priorities reinforce the strategic goals of the European Education Area and the EU’s position as a global leader in inclusive, ethical and values-driven international education. International education and research support broader EU goals: climate adaptation, global solidarity, innovation, and gender equality. Strong alumni networks enhance long-term EU influence and partnership-building, strengthening both internal cohesion and external engagement. They align with the EU’s external action objectives under the Global Gateway strategy and NDICI–Global Europe, both of which emphasise education, gender equality, climate action, and inclusive international partnerships. Ireland’s Presidency can help embed these priorities across EU agendas, ensuring that mobility, education, and inclusion are recognised not only as sectoral issues, but as strategic enablers of the Union’s future success."

From ICOS’ perspective, the Irish Presidency can make a lasting difference by championing joined-up, people-centred governance, especially in areas where EU institutions directly shape the lived experiences of mobile learners, international students, and their host communities. Strengthen trust in cross-border systems People feel the value of the EU when systems work, when immigration processes are predictable, housing is fair, rights are respected, and information is accessible. International students and researchers – who move for study, training, and research – are an important case in point. Their journeys rely on multiple EU-regulated systems across Member States. The Presidency can: Prioritise efficiency and transparency in visa and residency systems Promote consistency in qualification recognition and access to work Encourage consumer protections for mobile citizens, especially in digital markets Efficient, rights-based systems reduce stress, build social and economic resilience, and contribute to security by reducing uncertainty and vulnerability. For students and institutions, clearer pathways reduce stress, unlock opportunity, and support businesses and institutions in planning, recruiting, and retaining talent. Deliver fairness and protection through inclusive policy design Discrimination, exploitation, and exclusion – including hate crime and online hate speech – undermine EU values and erode social cohesion. International students, including those from third countries, are often vulnerable to racism, housing scams, precarious work, and unclear redress systems. Ireland’s Presidency can support: Rights-based policymaking across Council configurations Stronger accountability for actors profiting from mobility (e.g. recruitment, accommodation platforms) Investment in accessible, multilingual public information Protecting learners’ dignity and safety contributes to community stability and reflects the EU’s commitment to equality, non-discrimination, and fundamental rights. This benefits individuals and the communities, institutions, and businesses that depend on safe, ethical systems. Frame education mobility as a shared public good International education contributes not only to individual opportunity, but to broader public value across the Union. When properly supported, it strengthens: Local economies (housing, services, innovation hubs) Business ecosystems (talent development, alumni networks) Social cohesion (intercultural understanding, civic engagement) Well-managed mobility enhances competitiveness, skills development, and long-term innovation across Member States. By promoting ethical, inclusive international education, as part of the European Education Area and broader talent strategies, Ireland can help make the EU more globally attractive, economically competitive, and socially resilient. Lead by example in civic participation and inclusion Ireland’s Presidency can model inclusive civic engagement by creating space for youth, international students, and underrepresented communities to participate in EU discussions. These groups are often directly affected by EU policy but excluded from formal processes. Empowering their voices enhances transparency, trust, and legitimacy. The Council’s work can have lasting, people-centred impact by strengthening systems, protecting rights, and enabling participation. By championing EU values in practice – fairness, openness, solidarity, and opportunity – Ireland’s Presidency can help shape a future-ready Europe grounded in inclusion, sustainability, competitiveness, and collective security."

Students, whether participating in Erasmus+, on (inter)national or institutional scholarships, or self-funded, experience the EU not as an abstract project, but through tangible freedoms: to move, to study, to connect, to belong. Their journeys offer a powerful lens through which to communicate not only what the EU stands for, but also what it makes possible. ICOS proposes the following approaches to communicate EU values and build broader public ownership of Ireland’s 2026 Presidency: Amplify diverse student, researcher, and alumni voices International students and researchers speak directly to core EU values – freedom, dignity, and opportunity – through their lived experience. Sharing their stories, challenges, and contributions demonstrates how European cooperation delivers real public value. These narratives resonate across borders, generations, and sectors, while reflecting the EU’s competitiveness in education, research, and inclusive partnerships. Promote inclusion, belonging, and civic participation Student mobility is not a one-way process. International learners actively contribute to their host communities through volunteering, peer support, cultural exchange, and civic life. Tackling hate crime, discrimination, and hate speech is essential to ensuring these contributions are visible, safe, and valued. Highlighting these contributions shows how inclusion strengthens Europe, fosters innovation, and builds lasting, people-to-people partnerships. Use inclusive, accessible, multilingual channels To reach and engage diverse audiences, Presidency communications should reflect Europe’s linguistic and cultural diversity. Multilingual and youth-friendly content, shared via social media, education settings, and community organisations, can extend the Presidency’s reach, especially among newcomers, mobile citizens, and underrepresented groups. Make mobility visible, and rights clear Showcase how EU membership enables study, research, training, and cross-border exchange. This includes demystifying practical systems, such as visa renewals or digital residence permits, through user-centred, rights-based information. Strong, transparent systems not only build public trust; they also reinforce collective security by reducing discrimination, misinformation, and risk. When people see the EU improving access, transparency, and fairness, public trust grows. Create civic participation spaces for students and youth Civil society and student-led initiatives can act as trusted intermediaries, helping to make EU policy more tangible and relevant to citizens. Ireland’s Presidency can lead by embedding student voices into Presidency activities and legacy. Youth assemblies, student-led dialogues, and consultations aligned with the EU Youth Strategy and the EYCS Council configuration can support authentic engagement and long-term impact. This also strengthens the democratic foundations of the Union and builds ownership among future leaders. Ireland’s credibility in international education, rooted in people, partnerships, and shared values, offers a powerful platform to deliver these messages. The Presidency can help communicate not only what Europe is, but what it is becoming: open, fair, connected, and future-focused."
237,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4234644/Meta_Platforms_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_237.docx,Meta Platforms Ireland Limited,Business,Tech,National and European,1,"Proposed overarching slogan: A competitive, agile Europe in a fractious world. Why? An Taoiseach, Micheál Martin TD, recently said “We want to major on competitiveness in the six months of the Irish Presidency”. Europe’s citizens, consumers and businesses want Europe, once again, to be a leader on enterprise, innovation and technological development. Ireland, as a pro-market, business-friendly Member State, is perfectly placed to chair discussions and drive forward the competitiveness agenda. In his seminal report, Mario Draghi described competitiveness and productivity as an existential challenge for Europe. One year on, he says the issues are even more acute and Europe’s citizens are disappointed by how slowly the EU moves. The Council of the EU must take on this challenge and set the tone and pace of the competitiveness agenda. Chancellor Merz has gathered signatories by 19 other heads of state, including Ireland, calling for a systematic review of all EU regulations to identify rules that are superfluous, excessive, or unbalanced, as well as a thorough examination of the entire acquis of EU rules to determine whether regulations are still fit for purpose to meet the European Competitiveness goals. The Council of the EU should pursue this agenda in earnest. Digital policy must be at the centre of the competitiveness agenda - not simply viewed as one aspect of it. The Draghi report found that the EU is weak in emerging technologies, such as AI, that will drive future growth and that the productivity gap between the EU and the US is largely explained by the tech sector. Drawing on Draghi’s words, “Europe has long styled itself as a regulatory power—it must now prove it can adapt to a fast-changing technological landscape.” The simplification agenda behind the Digital Omnibus and the Digital Fitness Check represents a crucial moment to address the existing shortcomings and should not fall short of the big ambitions needed to ensure a more prosperous future of Europe. This moment requires a complete overhaul of Europe’s digital rulebook - a thorough revision of the entire digital acquis to determine which laws are still fit for purpose and truly support the European competitiveness ambitions. Moreover, a pause on implementation of the pipeline of digital laws is needed to allow for the regulatory revision to take place. Ireland is the third largest exporter of digitally delivered services in the world (WTO, 2023) - a recognised digital hub - and should adopt a leadership position in shaping Europe’s digital agenda. Europe needs to be open-minded and agile to benefit from and shape the economic developments of the coming decades. Ireland has benefitted hugely from US multinational investment and this is now very much a two-way street, with 200,000 people employed by Irish companies across all 50 US States. The broader EU-US economic relationship should be prioritised during Ireland’s Presidency, particularly in fast-moving areas like AI. Ireland has a unique relationship with the US and should ensure this is brought to the fore during its Presidency term to strengthen EU-US ties."
237,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4234644/Meta_Platforms_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_237.docx,Meta Platforms Ireland Limited,Business,Tech,National and European,2,"The Digital Omnibus The Commission’s Omnibus proposal takes some steps toward simplification, yet it falls significantly short. The Council should go much further. The AI Act European leaders such as Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi are actively questioning Europe’s approach to this once-in-a-generation moment to handle AI. A bolder pause and rethink of the AI Act is essential. While the delay of the High Risk framework was necessary, the way it is drafted is confusing and does not bring the necessary legal certainty. The proposal doesn’t address the General Purpose AI Model regime’s approach, which is redundant due to its duplicative attempt to regulate both upstream and downstream activities. The AI Act still lacks a clear mandate for regulators at both EU and national levels to promote innovation. The privacy framework (GDPR and ePrivacy Directive) While taking steps to modernise the privacy framework is positive, this is a missed opportunity to introduce the fundamental innovation principle that would set the foundations for a future-proof privacy regime. DPAs should be tasked with promoting a balanced approach that supports both data protection and economic growth, and should be held accountable for ensuring proportionality in their decisions. Digital Fitness Check Drawing on the call from 20 Heads of State, including Ireland, the Council should ensure that the EU's digital rules are effective, proportionate and fit for the future. Digital Fairness Act The Commission should withdraw the DFA. It contradicts the EU’s efforts to simplify digital regulations, introducing new rules for companies in areas already addressed by existing (and recent) EU laws. The October letter from 20 Heads of State called for “self-restraint when it comes to new legislation” and this is an example of over-regulation. Protecting Minors Online Meta believes that there is one area of the digital regulatory framework where an additional piece of targeted regulation is required. Ireland’s recent call that more urgent action is required at EU level on the question of online age verification is very welcome. Ireland should support an EU-wide digital majority age that would restrict access to certain online platforms, including social media, for younger teens unless they have parental approval. This approach mirrors the offline world, where parents set boundaries for their children’s activities. The most effective and efficient way to implement a solution is at the operating system (OS) or App store level. The OS or App store would serve as the first line of defense across the ecosystem, since this is where users initially engage and where age information is already collected. The OS or App store could share this signal with services such as Meta’s. EU Batteries Regulation The EU Batteries Regulation is an example of over-regulation which we know is of deep concern to Member States. Article 11 should be delayed for at least 3 years. Even if the Commission manages to carefully review all the applications for partial derogations, industry will be given only 1 year to comply (by February 2027) with a provision that deeply affects complex production processes. AI Summit Ireland should deliver an ambitious summit that critically evaluates Europe’s approach to AI. Ensure a good mix of contributors to the summit, including politicians, policymakers, industry, civil society and citizens. Reflect the breadth of debate in this area across the globe. It is particularly important that the voice of European industry is heard and understood during this event. CEOs from Siemens, Bosch, Ericsson and others have gone public, urging bold reform and a “Stop the Clock” on the AI Act to keep Europe competitive."
237,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4234644/Meta_Platforms_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_237.docx,Meta Platforms Ireland Limited,Business,Tech,National and European,3,"For people and communities The Council can ensure that the interests of people and communities are placed at the heart of the EU agenda. The European Commission, in particular, is often perceived as far removed from the views of people and communities and the Council is well placed to address this. In the last few years, many U.S. tech companies have been forced to hold back updates or put a pause on product plans due to the European regulatory environment, particularly related to privacy, data protection, and competition laws. The problems include overlapping regulations, inconsistent guidance and regulatory interpretations that go well beyond the laws enacted by EU policymakers, where economic considerations and competitiveness are not balanced as they should be against other rights, including privacy rights. This means that single-issue regulators, more often data protection authorities, do not ensure a fair balancing of rights. Moreover, regulatory enforcement is often fragmented and delayed across the EU as the GDPR’s “one-stop-shop” solution has been undermined. The Council can ensure that a better balance is struck, where EU consumers are protected and gain access to the best products and services available globally. Many EU citizens associate the EU with improving their rights and choices as consumers. That notion is now under threat. For businesses As Mario Draghi has pointed out, over-regulation stifles innovation. The people and communities mentioned above are not producing enough entrepreneurs and startups. Europe's share of global tech market capitalisation has collapsed from ~20% in 2000 to a mere ~4% today. None of the world's top 10 companies or most valuable unicorns calls Europe home. While the US and China race ahead, Europe is left further behind in the global AI race. This term of the Irish Presidency can put a spotlight on the factors that are preventing this generation of Europeans from producing the top companies of the future. We stand at a critical crossroads, especially in regard to AI. In Christine Lagarde’s words (November), “there are reasons to believe AI could spread faster, and deliver tangible economic gains sooner, than previous technology waves. If that is the path we are on – and I believe it may be – Europe needs to position itself accordingly. We need to remove all the obstacles that stop us from embracing this transformation. Otherwise we risk letting the wave of AI adoption pass us by and jeopardise Europe’s future…..And this time, the consequences extend beyond losing the race in AI models. We would eventually face a further loss of competitiveness for many of our sectors and industries.”"
237,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4234644/Meta_Platforms_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_237.docx,Meta Platforms Ireland Limited,Business,Tech,National and European,4,"“Europe’s citizens and companies value the diagnosis, the clear priorities and the action plans. But they also express growing frustration. They are disappointed by how slowly the EU moves. They see us failing to match the speed of change elsewhere. They are ready to act—but fear governments have not grasped the gravity of the moment.” (Mario Draghi, September 2025) It has been reported that only 11% of Mario Draghi’s recommendations have been implemented, one year on. Repeated implementation gaps lead to cynicism and apathy among citizens about the political system that represents them. In early December, the Irish Government published Accelerating Infrastructure - a Report and Action Plan to help drive the efficient delivery of infrastructure across Ireland. There is a collective drive and momentum to implement this new Report and Action Plan, across government as a whole, and its agencies. The same commitment to delivery should be brought to the implementation of the Draghi Report, across the entire European Commission. The Irish Presidency can make a virtue of its implementation – carry out a full-scale review, two years on, and – in the words of Minister Jack Chambers, demand “urgency, collaboration, and accountability at every level”. Citizens would see the values and benefits of EU membership if they could see the delivery of actions long-promised by political leaders - i.e. the EU doing what it said it would do. If the Irish Presidency could make this happen, citizens would see the public service and political system taking assertive action on their behalf, restoring trust and a sense of agency over the problems society has identified."
237,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f4234644/Meta_Platforms_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_237.docx,Meta Platforms Ireland Limited,Business,Tech,National and European,5,"Summary: Ireland’s Presidency should pursue a number of initiatives to help European citizens benefit from digital advancement. It is an opportunity to promote tech startups and unicorns, digital adoption among European SMEs and enhance the Digital Single Market. Ireland’s Presidency should promote initiatives to enhance the digital intensity of EU businesses, the up-skilling and re-skilling of the workforce and the digitalisation of public services, drawing on the targets set out in the forthcoming National Digital and AI Plan. Additionally, the Presidency should: Ensure all Directorate Generals reflect the ambition of a competitive digitalised single market in their initiatives, enable coherence in policy development and delivery. Remove bottlenecks and regulatory barriers in the Single Market which impact the rollout of digital products and services. Enable businesses to scale to become pan-European and global players, by addressing fragmented implementation and interpretation of digital rules to allow agility and enhance certainty for businesses and consumers. Deliver a Capital Markets/Savings and Investment Union. Enhance access to funding for digital entrepreneurs and innovation. Develop complementary sources of finance to bank lending. Diversifying the financing landscape will unlock additional funds necessary to finance the twin green and digital transitions (up to €500 billion a year until 2030). Unlock the potential of savings, pension funds and private wealth funds. Also encourage more venture capital support of start-ups from banks and venture capital companies from EU. At its April 2024 meeting in Dublin, the D9+ Ministers called for Europe to do more to create the conditions for EU unicorns. These commitments should be re-prioritised and debated as part of a dedicated D9+ meeting during Ireland’s Presidency. The Dublin Declaration said: “We, the D9+ Ministers: Will support efforts at national and EU level to address barriers hindering innovation and growth and fragmenting the digital single market, be they legal, administrative, or regulatory in nature; Support increased efforts to improve the investment environment for startups and scaleups to boost the EU’s competitiveness and innovation. We aim to work at national and EU level to mobilise private capital such as retail investor savings, pension funds and private wealth funds, for investment in innovative firms that have the potential to grow and achieve scale in the EU; Support exchange and implementation of best practice policies for incubation and ecosystem development for startups and scaleups, in order to boost Europe’s competitiveness and innovation potential, through organisations such as the European Startup Nations Alliance.”"

Europe is facing an epidemic of violence against women and girls (VAWG). This is manifesting both offline and online. trade is responsible for essentially grooming some children to perpetrate or submit to sexual Around 50 million women aged 18-74 in the EU or 31% have experienced physical (including threats) or sexual violence in adulthood. 35% of women in the youngest age group (aged 18 to 29) reported experiencing gender-based violence. 1 in 8 women have experienced sexual violence, including rape, by a non-partner 30% of women across the EU fear that fake intimate images of them may be shared without their consent. Online misogyny and abuse is on the rise and women and girls speak of the chilling effect this has on their participation in both online and offline spaces. A significant driver of this violence is the proliferation of violent, misogynistic, and degrading pornographic content online. Online pornography is normalising violence against women and girls, grooming men and boys to perpetrate sexual violence, and contributing to child-on-child sexual abuse. The average age a child in the EU accesses pornography is 13. According to SERP’s Facing Reality: Addressing the role of pornography in the pandemic of violence against women and girls report, ‘the pornography violence.’ Pornography has saturated our culture and laid the foundations for cyber violence against women and girls, including image-based sexual abuse (IBSA), ‘deepfake’ pornography and the growing threat of AI to women and children’s safety, particularly ‘nudification’ apps and ‘AI Girlfriends’. An online survey of 18-year-olds in four European countries found that: One in three had someone share sexually explicit images or video of them without their permission. Nearly one in three experienced a peer either sharing sexually explicit content with them or trying to talk to them about sexual topics online. Children’s unfettered access to online pornography is having a detrimental effect on their mental, emotional, physical and neurological wellbeing. Pornography is also a form of commercial sexual exploitation, with vulnerable and marginalised women and girls routinely trafficked and coerced into the pornography industry. Technology, including social media and messaging platforms, is utilised by human traffickers at all stages of exploitation, including the recruitment of women into this harmful industry. Pornography undermines our European values of ‘respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.’ The Commission’s proposed Gender Equality Strategy aims to ‘reinforce equality, inclusion and participation in all areas of society.’ This cannot be realised until we have stopped the free and unfettered access to violent pornography by both adults and children and actively held to account the pornography profiteers of sexual exploitation and human trafficking. Ireland is a leader in addressing DSGBV, as well as human trafficking and sexual exploitation. The launch of Cuan was a pivotal moment in our history. Ireland should harness this leadership now as we take on the EU Presidency."
336,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/002ee55d/Sexual_Exploitation_Research_and_Policy_Institute_-_Submission_336.docx,Sexual Exploitation Research and Policy Institute,,,,2,"Ireland should build on the work of the Danish Presidency and continue to focus on Gender Equality under the remit of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council. The Commission’s Programme of Work underscores the need for further action in this area. The planned Gender Equality Strategy 2026-2030 is a vital opportunity that can be harnessed in this regard. This Strategy must consider the impact of online pornography on violence against women and girls, both inside and outside of the pornography industry. The Strategy must reflect the lived experiences of women and girls who are affected by the harms of pornography, and the impact this has on their inclusion in offline and online spaces. It must also consider the role of pornography in domestic and intimate partner abuse and in driving rates of sexual assault and rape. This Strategy must also include addressing the impact of pornography on men and boys and how this shapes their sexual scripts and grooms them to perpetrate sexual violence. Ireland must also continue the work of the Danish Presidency in ensuring full implementation of the Directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence across all Member States. This Directive is key in outlining the obligations of Member States in relation to violence against women and domestic violence. Ireland should use its Presidency to work with Member States to ensure they are meeting these obligations and prioritising the safety of women and girls both online and offline. The Programme of Work also commits to making the online environment safe, fair and empowering so that people can make the most of technology. Currently the online environment is one infiltrated by misogyny, VAWG and unregulated AI experiments on women’s safety. Ireland must use its Presidency to ensure that the Digital Services Act is fit for purpose and that Member States have the power and capabilities to implement age verification for pornography at a national level. Again, following the Danish Presidency, Ireland should continue to work towards the realisation of The Jutland Declaration: Shaping a Safe Online World for Minors, of which Ireland is a signatory. Ireland should utilise the Digital Fairness Act to work towards implementing the European Parliament’s Resolution on the impact of harmful technologies and online content to minors, including calls for: A minimum age of 16 for access to social-media platforms, video-sharing platforms and AI companions. Possible bans on addictive product features such as infinite scrolling, autoplay, loot boxes and engagement-based recommendations. Strict age-verification enforcement including personal liability for senior managers where platforms fail to comply, and Regulation of AI tools including deepfakes and chatbots. While we understand that delaying children’s access to social media is a contested issue, especially concerning children’s rights to access the online world, the evidence is clear that the harms of social media are too acute to ignore. Unfettered access to harmful content online, including pornography is having a detrimental effect on young people. The tech and pornography industries should be held accountable for the harmful content on their sites as a matter of urgency. Until then the best option available is to delay children’s access to social media. Ireland should build on the new rules planned for tackling organised crime including human trafficking, as outlined in the Political Guidelines. This is an opportunity to work with Member States on identifying and addressing the role of human trafficking and exploitation within the pornography industry and wider commercial sexual exploitation."

This is not a feeling enjoyed by most women and girls across the EU. Research shows that women and girls do not feel safe online or offline. They live in fear of abuse, harassment and sexual assault in both online and offline spheres. They police themselves online, scared to post photos and videos, in case they are digitally altered, they restrict their own speech for fear of abuse and ridicule, they employ tech safety mechanisms to protect themselves from harassment. In the offline world, they do not run after dark, avoid taking taxi’s alone and shrink in work environments not designed for them. Women and girls do not enjoy the right to feel safe. The work of the Council during the term of the Irish Presidency can start to address this. A Gender Equality Strategy that: addresses the drivers of violence against women and girls including violent and misogynistic pornography; that truly places the experiences of women and girls at its center; and takes seriously the role of men and boys, could make a real difference to women and girls in EU Member States. Provided it is robustly implemented. Ireland has shown leadership at a national level in addressing DSGBV, it can now show leadership at the EU level. Equally if Ireland leads the Council’s work in addressing online harms by ensuring age verification for pornography can be implemented at a national level, this will have a very real impact. Age verification for pornography in the United Kingdom has resulted in a decrease in traffic to mainstream pornography websites. The regulator Ofcom has reported that overall, visitor numbers to the 10 most-visited pornography services in the UK have now settled at a “lower level” than before age verification was introduced in July this year. It is estimated that this decrease in traffic is a result of minors no longer being able to access pornography sites, as well as some adults who have chosen not to undertake the age verification process. Should EU Member States follow suit and implement national age verification with the support of the Council, they too could see a real and tangible impact in protecting children from online pornography. This in turn, would begin to help to reduce the impact of pornography on sexual violence amongst young people. The Presidency is a critical moment for Ireland. Women and girls in particular have lost faith in institutions and systems to protect them. A brave and bold agenda that puts women and girls’ safety at the heart of this Presidency can begin to turn that around, both in Ireland and across the EU."

In line with the request above regarding the framing of feedback (p.2), we would justify our recommendation by referencing: The Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, adopted by EU leaders including the Taoiseach, which commits to ‘creat[ing] good jobs’ (p.6); President von der Leyen’s Political Priorities for the 2024-2020 European Commission, which commit to putting forward a ‘Quality Jobs Roadmap, developed with the social partners [that] will support fair wages, good working conditions, training and fair job transitions for workers and self-employed people, notably by increasing collective bargaining coverage’ (p.18); The Joint Declaration on the EU legislative priorities for 2025 (March 2025), which commits to promote quality jobs in order to ‘boost Europe’s sustainable prosperity and competitiveness’ (p.3); The Danish Presidency’s policy programme, which commits to engaging with the European Commission’s Quality Jobs Roadmap (p.28); And the incoming Cypriot Presidency’s (draft) programme, which commits to ‘advance policies that promote quality employment’ (p.25). It would also reflect the views of the Council, the Commission and the European social partners (including BusinessEurope on behalf of IBEC, SMEUnited on behalf of ISME and the ETUC on behalf of ICTU) outlined in the Val Duchesse Tripartite Declaration of 31 January 2024, that the ‘EU’s future long-term competitiveness needs to go hand in hand with quality jobs’ (p.4). Taking account of the views set out in the consultation document above, it would contribute to making progress on policy areas and initiatives that are ‘likely to be of most value and relevance for the Union – and all of its 27 Member States’, ‘build on the work done by its predecessor in progressing the Council’s legislative and policy agenda’ and reflect the ‘programme of legislation’ planned by the European Commission - with the Commission’s 2026 work programme committing to follow-up its Quality Jobs Roadmap, issued on 3 December 2025 (tbc), with a legislative proposal for a Quality Jobs Act in Q4 2026. Quality jobs will also be a core element of other initiatives that will be on the Council’s agenda during the Irish Presidency, including the new action plan to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, the anti-poverty strategy, the gender equality strategy 2026-30, the fair labour mobility package, amongst others (see response to Question 2 below). Since the Taoiseach stated in his 20 November 2025 speech at Eurofound’s Foundation Forum: Europe’s social model – the key to competitive growth that the Government was looking forward to the Commission’s Quality Jobs Roadmap, which he said would set an ‘an ambitious employment agenda for the EU to remain competitive, innovative and fair, and create a level playing field that prioritises high standards for quality jobs’, it would be logical for this key initiative for workers in Ireland and all across Europe to be made a thematic priority of Ireland’s Presidency next year.

ICTU would also identify a number of other specific policy areas and legislative proposals that should also be a focus of work for the Irish Presidency: First, key pending legislative proposals of relevance to workers that may not be adopted by the end of the Cypriot Presidency. We would highlight proposals such as the draft traineeships directive; the draft regulation on support to workers affected by imminent job displacement in enterprises undergoing restructuring (i.e. amending the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund); the draft regulation on the coordination of social security systems, and the sixth revision of the carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxic substances directive (CMRD), amongst others. If these have not been adopted by June 2026, the Irish Presidency should aim to do so during its term. Second, previously announced Commission commitments for new initiatives of relevance to workers that are expected over the coming weeks: to a new action plan to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights (announced for Q4 2025) and the EU housing package (consisting of the European Affordable Housing Plan, the review of state aid rules on services of general economic interest in order to better facilitate support for affordable housing, the housing construction strategy, etc. and now announced for 16 December 2025). We would also highlight specific commitments in the Commission’s 2026 work programme, particularly the legislative proposal on a public procurement act (expected in Q2 2026); the legislative and non-legislative initiatives on short-term rentals (Q2 2026); the fair labour mobility package, consisting of legislative proposals for a European Social Security Pass, to strengthen the European Labour Authority, and on skills portability (Q3 2026); the ‘fairness package’, consisting of an ‘inter-generational fairness strategy’ (Q1 2026), an anti-poverty strategy (Q2 2026), and strengthening the European child guarantee (Q2 2026); and the gender equality strategy 2026-2030 (Q1 2026), amongst others. The Irish Presidency should also focus on ensuring the effectiveness of the European Fair Transition Observatory, which should become operational in early 2026, and the Commission’s report on the implementation of the EU occupational safety and health (OSH) Framework Directive and related directives, expected by mid-2026. On all of these, it should commit to legislation and measures that improves living and working conditions in accordance with Ireland’s treaty obligations (TFEU, Article 151) and oppose legislation and measures that run counter to this obligation, such as ‘simplification’ initiatives that, as the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights’ 2025 report warns (pages 8-9), are presented as a means to alleviate as a means to alleviate regulatory burdens on businesses, a number of these changes – if adopted – risk weakening human rights’, especially for workers and consumers. Equally, it should not support proposal for a 28th Company Regime (expected Q1 2026) that encompasses labour law, as this would enable companies to circumvent national labour laws and collective agreements."
188,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/acad44d8/Irish_Congress_of_Trade_Unions_-_Submission_188.docx,Irish Congress of Trade Unions,Trade Unions,All sectors and all areas of work,All.,3,"This could and would be done by promoting the adoption of legislation and strategies that strengthen and develop the EU framework on social dialogue including collective bargaining across a range of initiatives that will be on the Council’s agenda during the Irish Presidency. This should take account of the Court of Justice of the European Union’s 11th November 2025 ruling in Denmark’s legal challenge to the adequate minimum wages directive, which unequivocally upheld all of the Directive’s provisions promoting collective bargaining as fully compatible with the EU treaties. Again, we would justify this recommendation by referencing: The statement by EU leaders (including the Taoiseach) at the Porto Social Summit in May 2021, which stressed that Europe’s ‘social dimension, social dialogue and the active involvement of social partners are at the core of a highly competitive social market economy’; The Council Recommendation of 12 June 2023 on strengthening social dialogue, which acknowledges that ‘Member States with robust frameworks for social dialogue and a wide coverage of collective bargaining tend to have more competitive and resilient economies’; The European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, which commits the EU and its Member States to ‘the aim of further strengthening social dialogue’. The Council’s guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (December 2024), which consider social dialogue and collective bargaining as key to ensuring both economic competitiveness and social fairness. And the Commission’s recent consultation document for its first stage consultation of the European social partners on the Quality Jobs Act which states that, ‘Strong social dialogue and collective bargaining help improve working conditions, health and safety at work and mitigate labour shortages, contributing to a competitive, resilient and inclusive social market economy (p.14)’. Furthermore, the Letta Report emphasised that if Europe is to be effective in supporting businesses and quality jobs, there needs to be increased coordination and negotiation mechanisms between employers and it specifically identified social dialogue and collective bargaining as ‘unique tools for governments and social partners to find tailored and fair solutions (p.105), while the Draghi report stressed that competitiveness today is ‘less about relative labour costs and more about knowledge and skills embodied in the labour force’, explicitly warned against seeking to promote competitiveness by using wage repression to lower relative costs’ (p.13), and emphasized the importance of involving trade unions, ‘who have the ability to build the trust necessary to shape pathways of technology and skills upgrades that can truly benefit both companies and workers’ (p.274). The Irish Presidency should therefore promote measures that strengthens and develops the EU framework on social dialogue including collective bargaining, in particular through the new action plan to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, the Quality Jobs Roadmap and the legislative proposal for a Quality Jobs Act and the legislative proposal for a public procurement act, and other relevant initiatives that will be on the Council’s agenda during Ireland’s presidency."

We recognise and appreciate that the Irish Presidency will face an extremely busy agenda and a very heavy work load across a wide range of areas during its term. But we cannot under-emphasise the importance of the Irish Presidency addressing and being seen to address the main day-to-day challenges facing workers and their families, especially rising prices, inflation and the cost of living, which were identified as the most important issues at national level in 18 Member States and the second most important issue in seven Member States (including Ireland), according to the most recent Eurobarometer survey (Standard Eurobarometer 103) conducted in Spring 2025. Since the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 committed to address the ‘aspirations of our citizens’, the most effective way of Ireland doing this as far as workers are concerned would be by strengthening and developing the EU’s framework on social dialogue and collective bargaining during its Council Presidency. As the Council’s 2023 Recommendation on strengthening social dialogue points out, countries with ‘robust frameworks for social dialogue and a wide coverage of collective bargaining tend to have more competitive and resilient economies’."

This process provides a vital opportunity for communities such as ours to help shape the Presidency’s priorities, by highlighting our perspectives and experiences as active citizens. We support making “Resilience” the main theme of the Presidency. Europe is dealing with major challenges such as climate change, environmental pressures, political uncertainty and rising social and economic stresses. In this context, resilience is essential. This suggestion aligns with the EU’s strategic agenda for a strong and secure Europe. For us, resilience is far more than preparing for crises or rebuilding after them. It is about cultivating the skills, networks and solidarity mechanisms that allow societies to transform, innovate and thrive. True resilience enables communities and countries not merely to withstand shocks, but to regenerate, adapt and shape a better future. Ireland’s Presidency offers an important opportunity to promote a broad, community-centred understanding of resilience. Through this consultation, communities like ours can help shape priorities in ways that reflect lived local experience and the realities of active citizens across Ireland. Our close cooperation with our local authority, Fingal County Council, has helped us achieve a lot. Together we have developed pollinator corridors, planted urban orchards, improved local infrastructure, run planning consultations, promoted active travel and delivered climate education. Support from Government and local grants has allowed us to grow our work and bring real benefits to our town. It is this partnership and collaborative spirit that is an essential ingredient of societal resilience. In our experience, resilience is both deeply local and inherently systemic. It depends on more than infrastructure or emergency response plans. It grows from everyday practices: shortening supply lines for food and energy, reducing waste, living in harmony with nature and strengthening the relationships and skills that bind communities together. Resilience relies fundamentally on social capital - trust, solidarity, shared knowledge and collective responsibility. To build resilience, communities and countries need inviting public spaces, places to meet and learn, access to practical skills, opportunities for young and old to learn together, reliable and accessible information and analysis, inclusive policy processes, and well-organised local support mechanisms. Investments in these areas help communities feel confident, informed and ready for whatever comes next. We encourage the Government to make community-led resilience a central part of Ireland’s Presidency agenda. This means integrating citizen and local group perspectives into policy agendas, supporting volunteer-led initiatives through grants and expert collaboration with local authorities, and prioritising long-term resilience over short-term crisis response. Key areas include responsive and inclusive local democratic processes, climate-adaptive infrastructure, decentralised renewable energy, sustainable and accessible transport, and financial mechanisms such as home retrofitting supports, incentives for local food production, and sustainability measures for businesses."

We would like to see the Irish Presidency of the Council in 2026 focus on policy areas and legislative proposals that support local communities in becoming more resilient. Ireland already has inspiring examples of resilience in action. The Cloughjordan Ecovillage shows how a community can live sustainably. The Sustainable Energy Communities network brings local groups together to reduce energy use and increase efficiency. Community gardens and allotments across the country are helping people grow food, protect biodiversity, meet neighbours and strengthen local food security. In the economy, credit unions support local businesses and community projects, Local Enterprise Offices help small businesses become more sustainable, and Community Wealth Building projects aim to keep economic value within local communities. In housing, cost rental homes offer long-term affordable rents, and community-led housing groups provide secure homes that strengthen local connections. Retrofitting schemes help households cut energy costs and become more resilient to rising fuel prices. In health and wellbeing, community-based care is expanding, and social prescribing connects people with local activities and support mechanisms that improve health and reduce isolation. These examples show that resilience is already being built across Ireland in practical, community-driven ways that support people, nature and local economies. Resilience means giving communities the tools, confidence and support they need to adapt and flourish in a changing world. Ireland’s 2026 EU Presidency is a chance to highlight the role of communities as central actors in this effort. The more EU policy and legislation can support this, the better the outcomes for all EU citizens."

Therefore, I think Ireland’s top three priorities should be: 1. to promote peace, do all it can to stop war (particularly in Gaza, but also in Ukraine, Sudan, and other parts of the world), including passing the Occupied Territories Bill; 2. do all it can to stop further degradation to the environment, by passing laws banning forever chemicals, and severely limiting plastics, pesticides, nitrates and other poisons, as well as limiting the use of fossil fuels. Instead it should support technologies that provide environmentally sustainable and healthful alternatives; 3. Promote people’s wellbeing, the building of small communities and social supports, and the development of small businesses and social enterprises by limiting the power of corporates. Themes – peace and justice; environmental repair not despair; people’s needs rather than business’s (focus on community and small local businesses instead – fostering ‘all for one and one for all’ attitudes)."

The EU must stand up for Gaza as well as for Ukraine. The authority of the International and European courts must recognized and adhered to. Israel cannot be trusted (nor the US). Since 1948 Israel has been stealing land belonging to Palestinians, with the intent of eventually getting rid of all the Palestinian people, which it is doing now. A global Europe should embrace respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, and Ireland, as a neutral country, should put peace and justice at the top of its presidential agenda, using all lawful means in its power to achieve it. Furthermore, buying/selling ‘defence’ systems from/to Israel and the US gives them information and power to dictate national/European and international policy – this cannot continue. EU security information should not go outside of Europe, therefore, Ireland should prioritise the development of the capacities needed to house and process its data in Europe (e.g. European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, sufficient clean energy, water for cooling, and environmentally fair processes for decontaminating that water.). Supporting people and strengthening Europe’s social model: Rather than making it harder for migrants and asylum seekers seeking shelter in Europe, Ireland should focus on all the positives that they bring with them and how much they add to the European economy. They are very often hard-working, innovative, and entrepreneurial and can contribute to their new host country. Supporting people, strengthening our societies and our social model: Ireland should focus on establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality, and on supporting children and young people to grow in healthy, safe, and clean environments. Therefore, Ireland should work on the proposed regulation to ensure that limits are set for all toxic materials and ‘forever’ chemicals are banned. Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature: Ireland is well placed to lead on the Vision for Agriculture and Food, but it should not accept the nitrates derogation it has recently been given. Instead Ireland should withstand commercial interests and push them to find alternative solutions, such as using multi-species planting to capture nitrogen in the soil safely (using legumes for example). Therefore, Ireland should lead policy development on identifying, planning, implementing, and incentivizing uptake of better crop farming practices, and evaluating the outcomes. Millions of small farming projects should be encouraged across all regions to develop sustainable local farming practices in every EU country. The livestock and fishing industries also need to be more sustainable. Ireland should lead out on restricting fishing vessels from fishing close to the coast where fish reproduce, ban bottom trawling (which destroys the ecosystems on the seabed), and introduce at-sea monitoring (live cctv) of commercial fishing vessels to ensure compliance, to allow fish stocks to recover."

The main goal of the Commission is to make Europe economically competitive and a good place for business. There is nothing wrong with that, until business objectives compete with social objectives. The Council can work to make sure that the needs and values of the member states and their peoples are not neglected when such conflicts arise, particularly when businesses can impact people’s health and wellbeing (with unhealthy commodities such as tobacco, alcohol, drugs, gambling, sugar-sweetened drinks, and ultra-processed foods, or by-products that poison the water/land/rivers/sea/air). Better regulation is not regulation that is easier for industry actors to comply with, it is regulation that safeguards the people first, and then secondly makes it easier for industry to comply. The Council must defend people’s right to a healthy environment and prevent industry from taking that away. Please keep this in mind every time industry actors promote the benefit of their product or their industry on the economy, and ask who benefits here? If it adversely impacts the environment, people’s health, happiness, work, relationships, or freedoms, is the opportunity worth the cost? If the people benefitting are not the ones bearing the cost and the impacts, is it fair?"

Unfortunately, by July there will probably be another heatwave across Europe, with more fires (and possibly floods too), otherwise I would suggest a European street party. Perhaps you could plan supports for people affected by these disasters next summer, maybe bring some of them over to Ireland for respite. I think asking people’s opinions over the next six months regarding what Ireland should do during its presidency is a good way to get people involved (not in forms like this, but in interviews on TV, social media, on the streets) and talking about it. Then see where those conversations take you/us. And pass the Occupied Territories Bill as an act of solidarity and people power to fight genocide."

This should be alongside a focus on ensuring regulations are updated and any new proposals are brought back into alignment with single market regulatory approaches and truly work to create a single market. There should also be a process for EU industry input and member state alignment on OECD global minimum tax and other regulatory affairs that ensures a level playing field for EU companies.

Unification can never be achieved against something, especially not against Russia, which is an integral part of Europe. It is crucial to find a way for open discussion with citizens and in societies across borders about the crucial questions which determine the future: How can we shape a new multipolar world peacefully? How can a diverse world work together and live in peace without getting lost in rivalries? How can we achieve understanding in diversity instead of division (“us” versus “them”)? How can we emancipate Europe from NATO, GAFA, and the dollar/US financial system so that we are free and autonomous in terms of economics and information and not bound in our international politics? How can we prevent a ‘national regression’ in the face of the multiple crises in Europe and strives for a fundamental rethinking of Europe's political structures, both internally and externally. How can we find a peaceful European integration with all countries on this continent and become a neutral, non-aligned mediator in international conflict? How can we rediscover and revive our fundamental European values and interests, because if we do so, we will find out what unites us as Europeans? The European Peace Project, together with the European Transcontinental Initiative, is a platform where reflection on these questions can take place."

European Transcontinental Initiative",Citizens initiative and thinktank,"Peace, International and European politics","We are a EU organizations/initiative, which is mainly conentrated on two objectives: First: the deficit of democracy within the architecture of EU institutions, Second: A European security architectur, which includes Russia and would establish long lasting peace with the Russian Federation.",5,"Please read our attached memorandum, which we wrote 20 years after the failure of the European Constitutional Treaty. Europe stands at a critical historical juncture and must fundamentally rethink its political project in order to survive as a meaningful global actor. The EU, conceived largely as a contractual and technocratic arrangement, lacks a living political identity and democratic foundation. To prevent its disintegration, Europe needs an emancipatory transformation equivalent to a core institutional renovation: it must free itself from unilateral transatlantic dependence, reconnect with its citizens, and pursue balanced cooperation with all global powers. Above all, Europe must rediscover its own intellectual, political, social, and economic traditions to help shape a just and peaceful 21st century. The continent risks being torn between defenders of a distant, technocratic EU and advocates of a return to the nation state. This polarization threatens to turn long-standing debates about reforming Europe into a rejection of Europe altogether. Conventional reforms are no longer sufficient to resolve the structural crisis of European democracy. Instead, Europe must renew its original post-war ambition as a peace project that transcended national conflicts and sought to establish a democratic, social, and decentralized political entity. Sadly there is broad decay in Europe’s political, economic, strategic, social, and cultural spheres. While EU institutions still exist, Europe’s intellectual foundations—rooted in Enlightenment, humanism, and universalism—are eroding. Postcolonial guilt narratives, postmodern individualism, and monopolistic capitalism have displaced Europe’s universal political spirit and its promises of democracy and peace. A pivotal missed opportunity followed the peaceful revolutions of 1989. The fall of the Berlin Wall offered the chance to build a sovereign, federal Europe reconciled with Russia and freed from Cold War divisions. This vision culminated in the draft European Constitution of 2004, which failed after referendums in France and the Netherlands. Without a constitution, the EU could not establish democratic legitimacy, civic unity, or sovereignty. As a result, Europe became unable to protect its citizens or its culture from globalization and subordinated the common good to powerful economic interests. Two foundational mistakes underpin this crisis. First, Europe assumed it could achieve emancipation alongside the United States, underestimating that a sovereign Europe contradicts US strategic interests. Second, Europe aligned culturally with American postmodernism rather than grounding unity in its own diverse cultural traditions. These errors contributed to renewed geopolitical conflict, including the war in Ukraine, and the abandonment of Europe’s peace narrative. Let us think beyond the current EU: democratic, sovereign, and culturally rooted. This vision centers on equal political rights for all European citizens—moving beyond “market citizenship”—while preserving decentralization and subsidiarity. Europe could become a republic in which legal equality coexists with cultural diversity, providing collective protection in a multipolar world. F Europe’s shared cultural heritage is crucial for it´s identity and unity —its revolutions, social movements, arts, philosophy, and humanist critique of technology—as the basis for renewed legitimacy and trust. A post-Atlantic Europe, committed to peace, open to dialogue with the Global South, and guided by a new humanism, is not a utopia but as a rediscovery of Europe’s enduring essence, waiting to be given political form."

The Presidency should place decent livelihoods for small- and medium-scale farmers, farm workers and rural communities at the heart of the EU agenda. This means prioritising fair prices, strong social protections, and policies that enable people to remain on the land and in rural areas. A Presidency focus on fair livelihoods would align Ireland with the growing European movement for a redistributive CAP and stronger market regulation. Theme 2 – A Just Green Transition through Agroecology The European Green Deal and the Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 require a farming model that can deliver simultaneously on climate, biodiversity, water and food security. The Presidency should highlight agroecology as a central pathway for the CAP post-2027 and for wider EU policies on soil health, nature restoration, climate adaptation and resilience. This includes supporting diversified farming systems, reduced dependence on synthetic inputs, and a transition away from extractive, export-oriented models. Theme 3 – Food Sovereignty, Democracy and Local Food Systems Citizens are increasingly concerned about food affordability, quality, and origin. The Presidency should foreground Food Sovereignty as a democratic framework for food systems – strengthening local and regional food economies, short supply chains, and public participation in decision-making. This links directly to the EU’s cohesion, health, social inclusion and security agendas, and can be reflected in the work of multiple Council formations (AGRIFISH, ENVI, EPSCO, GAC). Food Sovereignty is the democratic foundation for a fair and sustainable food system, linking farmers’ rights, seed autonomy, and community-led food distribution Together these themes would allow Ireland to act as an honest broker while still offering a positive, future-oriented vision: an EU where land, livelihoods and democracy are central to the green transition, and where rural communities are recognised as key partners in delivering Union-wide objectives."
152,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/780d9dad/Talamh_Beo_-_Submission_152.docx,Talamh Beo,Farmers Organisation,Farming and Food Systems,National/EU,2,"From Talamh Beo’s perspective, the Irish Presidency should focus on the following priority areas within the Council’s 2026 work: 1. CAP Post-2027 Orientation (AGRIFISH / ENVI / ECOFIN) Lead early Council debates on fundamental CAP reform, including a move away from uncoupled, hectare-based payments toward “public money for public goods”, targeted to environmental and social outcomes Promote mandatory capping and degressivity of direct payments, prioritising small- and medium-scale family farms and active farmers. Ensure that the Council conclusions on CAP post-2027 explicitly reference agroecology and diversified farming systems as key instruments for delivering Green Deal and biodiversity objectives. 2. Market Regulation and Fair Prices (AGRIFISH / COMPET) Strengthen the Common Market Organisation (CMO): explore tools for production management, crisis reserves and strategic stocks to stabilise prices and ensure cost-covering farm incomes. Without strong market regulation tools, farmers are structurally exposed to price volatility and corporate abuses. Strengthening the CMO is essential for restoring farmers’ bargaining power. Advance Council work on implementation and possible revision of the Unfair Trading Practices Directive, with stronger enforcement, transparency and penalties. 3. Food Sovereignty and Local Food Systems (AGRIFISH / ENVI / EPSCO / GAC) Highlight best practice on local food policy frameworks that recognise local food producers, short supply chains, and local processing infrastructure. Support legislative and policy initiatives that increase EU production of fruit, vegetables and protein crops, reducing import dependence and enhancing food autonomy, including specific income supports for Local Food Producers. Prioritise generational renewal and land access in rural development and cohesion discussions, including land observatories, support for new entrants and tools to address land concentration, such as and EU Directive on Land to address speculation, concentration and artificialisation, and to guarantee young and new farmers access to land and credit. 4. Trade and Global Solidarity (FAC / TRADE / AGRIFISH) Use the Presidency to steer Council discussions towards coherent trade policies that do not undermine EU climate, biodiversity and social goals. Create space for a political discussion on trade deals such as MERCOSUR, and on reforms to prevent agricultural dumping and to support food sovereignty in partner countries. Trade agreements such as MERCOSUR undermine small farms, depress prices, and accelerate environmental destruction, contradicting EU objectives for equality and climate action."
152,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/780d9dad/Talamh_Beo_-_Submission_152.docx,Talamh Beo,Farmers Organisation,Farming and Food Systems,National/EU,3,"The work of the Council during Ireland’s Presidency can deliver substantial positive impact if it pursues an integrated approach that connects farm incomes, environmental sustainability and community resilience. For people and communities, prioritising agroecology and local food systems can: Improve access to healthy, affordable food, particularly in low-income and peripheral regions. Create meaningful, place-based employment in farming, processing, distribution, tourism and care for the land. Enhance public health by supporting diets rich in fresh, minimally processed food. Strengthen social cohesion, as citizens reconnect with local farmers, landscapes and cultures. For businesses, especially SMEs and family farms, a rebalanced policy agenda can: Provide more predictable prices and income stability through improved market regulation. Support diversification and innovation (e.g. horticulture, mixed farming, value-added processing, community-supported agriculture). Reduce exposure to volatile global commodity chains and input markets by supporting soil health, on-farm biodiversity and circular use of nutrients and energy. For the EU as a whole, these priorities would: Contribute directly to climate mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection, water quality and soil health. Increase food system resilience to shocks (climate events, conflicts, pandemics). Help address citizens’ concerns about fairness, concentration of power and democratic control over essential resources such as land, water and seeds. Analysis shows that small and medium farms are the backbone of rural employment, biodiversity and cultural identity. Policies that protect these farms offer the greatest return in terms of resilience, social cohesion and climate mitigation. An Irish Presidency that deliberately links fair livelihoods, living landscapes and strong communities can help rebuild trust in the European project, particularly in rural regions where citizens often feel left behind by globalisation and past policy choices."

Talamh Beo suggests: People-centred storytelling Highlight real stories of farmers, food workers, communities and youth from across the EU who are building resilient local food systems, restoring ecosystems and sustaining rural life Showcase the alternative systems already put in place by communities across Europe to produce and distribute food in short supply chains, and the accompanying research which demonstrates their many benefits Local and regional dialogues Organise Presidency-branded public forums and town-hall conversations in rural towns and urban neighbourhoods, co-hosted with local authorities, farmers’ groups, youth and community organisations, to engage discussions on Food Sovereignty Integrate these dialogues into formal Presidency events (e.g. informal AGRIFISH, ENVI or GAC meetings) so that Ministers hear directly from citizen Visible, participatory events in Ireland Host accessible Presidency events on food, farming and rural futures that are open to the public as well as decision-makers, not just closed diplomatic meetings Incorporate culture, arts and heritage – for example, food festivals, farm visits, storytelling, and local markets – to show the EU as part of daily life Support organisations already active in Ireland on Food Sovereignty and Agroecology during the presidency Youth and schools engagement Develop Presidency education packs for schools focusing on EU decision-making and food systems, including visits, debates and exchanges between schools in different Member States. Digital engagement and transparency Provide clear, plain-language updates on Presidency negotiations and outcomes, explaining why they matter for households, farmers, workers and small businesses By making food, land and community central to its communications, Ireland can show citizens that the EU is not an abstract bureaucracy but a shared project shaping the future of their local places."

75,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/3b091730/Burrenbeo_Trust_-_Submission_75.docx,Burrenbeo Trust,,,,1,"Ireland’s Presidency in 2026 should foreground Community Stewardship for a Resilient Europe—a theme that reflects the EU’s ambitions on climate, biodiversity, food security, cohesion and democratic engagement. This aligns directly with the lived experience of place-based organisations such as the Burrenbeo Trust and it’s pan European Farming for Nature (FFN) initiative, which demonstrate that the most enduring climate and nature solutions come from empowered, informed communities. Three overarching thematic priorities are proposed: A nature positive Europe through community stewardship Place-based, community led models (such as Burrenbeo’s Heritage Keepers and Hare’s Corner programmes) demonstrate how citizens can become active custodians of their environment. These participatory approaches deliver measurable biodiversity gains, stronger local economies, and more resilient rural development. The Presidency should champion EU support for local stewardship initiatives, especially within AGRIFISH and ENVI Council configurations. A fair and future proof agricultural system led by farmers The Farming for Nature programme offers a proven European model for positive farmer recognition, peer to peer learning, and practical biodiversity action. The multi-country network (Ireland, Austria, Lithuania) shows the scalability of this constructive, non polarising approach. Elevating farmer led innovation aligns with the Strategic Agenda’s call for resilient agriculture, balanced land management, and strengthened rural cohesion. A participatory, people centred Europe To address disconnection from EU institutions, the Presidency should highlight models that activate citizen engagement, particularly in rural and peripheral regions. Burrenbeo’s community festivals, placebased learning, and youth programmes demonstrate how cultural heritage and environmental care can rebuild trust, identity and social inclusion. These priorities would allow Ireland to lead with integrity, drawing from successful home grown European facing models while serving the needs of all Member States."

Burrenbeo’s work shows how community engagement accelerates restoration and reduces conflict. Ireland could champion EU guidance that integrates community led monitoring, local education, and farmer involvement. Strengthening agri-environment schemes through farmer networks The FFN model (now operational across Ireland, Austria and Lithuania) demonstrates how positive recognition, ambassador networks, and farm walks drive adoption of biodiversity actions. Legislative work under AGRIFISH could integrate “farmer-to-farmer knowledge exchange” as a recognised pillar within CAP strategic plans. Rural development and social cohesion The Presidency could foreground landscape level partnerships, such as Burrenbeo’s community stewardship programmes, as models for the EU’s Long Term Vision for Rural Areas. Support for bottomup governance structures would strengthen community resilience and accelerate rural participation in climate and biodiversity transitions. Youth and Education for Sustainability Through the EYCS configuration, Ireland could progress initiatives supporting place-based learning, heritage education, citizen science and youth leadership, areas where Burrenbeo has decades of practical expertise. Embedding environmental literacy into EU programmes would foster long-term civic ownership of EU goals."

The Burrenbeo and FFN experiences show that when individuals feel ownership over their landscape, change becomes lasting, cost-effective and socially supported. Ireland could maximise impact in the following ways: Elevate real examples of community and farmer leadership across Europe Through Presidency events and Council discussions, Ireland can highlight practical case studies such as FFN ambassador farm walks, Austrian biodiversity outreach, Lithuanian farm plans, and Ireland’s learnercentred community stewardship programmes to demonstrate what success looks like on the ground. Strengthen EU support for participatory governance Council work could promote mechanisms that empower local actors: stewardship-based schemes, community monitoring, farmer mentor networks, and landscape partnerships. These ensure EU policies deliver tangible results for people and businesses. Foster cross-border rural innovation networks The existing FFN tri-country partnership is a working blueprint for how rural actors can share knowledge, co-create solutions and build European solidarity. The Irish Presidency could support similar networks in other Member States, creating durable peer-learning structures with low cost and high impact. Make climate and biodiversity policies socially inclusive The Presidency can champion approaches that are not punitive or divisive but motivational and solutions oriented. FFN’s ambassador model, where farmers lead by example, build trust and communicate results, shows how policy goals can align with farmer pride and community cohesion. The networks and sense of collective action developed through programmes such as the Hare’s Corner and Heritage Keepers further speak to the social role of environmental and climate actions."

The following approaches are suggested: 1. Showcase citizen and farmer-led European success stories Use Presidency events, digital communication, and local engagement to highlight examples like: FFN ambassadors improving biodiversity while building thriving farm enterprises; Burrenbeo led community festivals and learning programmes that foster pride of place; Austrian and Lithuanian partners developing films, farm plans, kitchen-table discussions, and outreach activities. These stories make the EU tangible, human, and relatable. Bring Presidency conversations into communities Ireland could: host Presidency linked farm walks and community events, use local media, schools, and NGOs to share “EU in my Place” stories, involve youth groups, volunteers, and local heritage organisations. Promote a positive narrative of Europe as a partner in resilience By emphasising community stewardship, sustainable food systems, and rural futures, Ireland can communicate the EU as a supportive, collaborative space that strengthens local identity rather than diluting it. Engage mainstream and social media using ambassador voices Ireland can model innovative solutions, using ambassadors, digital storytelling, local festivals, and cocreated content that showcases the EU as relevant to daily life."

Organisations like Burrenbeo Trust and it’s Farming for Nature network have pioneered forms of community participation and farmer-led environmental action that have already gained traction across Europe. A European expansion is underway, with: Austria: ambassador films, public outreach, farm walks, awards events with public participation, and a growing nomination process; Lithuania: farm biodiversity plans, farm walks, online discussions, farmer engagement materials, and long-term LIFE funding proposals; • Ireland: 120+ ambassadors, extensive peer-to-peer mentorship, a major annual national festival, and farmer-led biodiversity action. These initiatives demonstrate a practical, scalable pathway for delivering the EU’s climate, food system, and rural development goals in a way that strengthens community resilience and democratic engagement. Ireland’s Presidency can use these working models to champion a shift from policy for communities to policy with and by communities—a principle that can underpin a more innovative, cohesive and futureorientated European Union."

The European Commission is expected to present its EU Cardiovascular Health Plan on 16 December 2025. Consequently, the Irish Presidency will lead efforts in the Council resulting from the Cardiovascular Health Plan. Blood and Beyond would like to see the Irish Presidency help in bringing attention to the relationship between poor health, caused by anaemia, iron deficiency, blood loss, and coagulopathy, and cardiovascular diseases. Anaemia, for example, is the leading cause of poor blood health worldwide. Only in Europe, more than 28 million people are estimated to suffer anaemia. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, anaemia is a neglected but major cardiovascular risk amplifier that worsens cardiovascular disease outcomes and increases mortality. There is clear evidence linking untreated anaemia to heart failure, ischemic events, and perioperative complications. As Blood and Beyond, we believe that blood health optimization (including anaemia prevention and treatment) should be included among modifiable determinants to be looked at in the “EU Cares for Your Heart” Flagship initiative. We advocate for stronger actions on early diagnosis and screening, as early diagnosis of anaemia reduces hospitalisations and improves cardiovascular outcomes. We support the inclusion of haemoglobin and iron status as health check indicators in the upcoming 2026 Council Recommendation on health checks. As regards care pathways, the current state of play is characterized by fragmented care pathways and lack of standardization. Against this backdrop, an effective, standardized vehicle to improve blood health is Patient Blood Management (PBM). PBM is an evidence-based, patient-centred standard of care endorsed by the World Health Organization. EU work to implement the objectives of the upcoming EU Cardiovascular Health Plan should consider the implementation of PBM programmes to improve quality of care, reduce transfusion-related complications arising from postoperative recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Another important element to consider in the implementation of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan is ensuring health equity. The EU is working to reduce inequalities in health. Against this backdrop, it is worth emphasizing that anaemia prevalence is much higher among women of reproductive age, the elderly, low-income populations, and chronic disease patients. Therefore, optimising the population’s blood health should be a goal in the implementation of cardiovascular health actions at the EU and national levels. Apart from addressing Blood Health in the context of the policy work on Cardiovascular Health, we would like the Irish Presidency to also give greater attention to the topic of Blood Health in the broader framework of non-communicable diseases and as a standalone issue to tackle. All in all, the Irish Presidency has a strategic opportunity to elevate the blood health in the EU policy agenda, starting from the upcoming EU work on cardiovascular diseases."

This covers many areas in which Ireland can be a leader and role model. Our submission will focus on education as a key aspect of a Social Europe, and specifically on adult literacy education. Access to education, training and lifelong learning is a right enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, and Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union says the Union will promote a “high level” of education and training for all EU citizens. Education, training and lifelong learning also enable a host of other rights to be realised. In Ireland today, 21% of adults have literacy needs, 25% have numeracy needs (both figures are from the OECD Survey of Adult Skills 2023), and 27% have digital literacy needs (Digital Economy and Society Index 2023). This means that these adults don’t have the level of reading, maths or digital skills considered necessary to fully participate and reach their potential in today’s society. Across EU countries, the level of literacy need ranges from 12% in Sweden to 42% in Portugal. The level of numeracy need ranges from 12% in Finland and Sweden to 40% in Portugal (OECD Survey of Adult Skills 2023). And the average level of digital literacy need in the EU is 44%, ranging from 17% in the Netherlands to 72% in Romania (Digital Economy and Society Index 2023). Literacy and numeracy needs are associated with poor health, low life satisfaction, unemployment, low incomes and low social trust. A person with literacy or numeracy needs is less likely to believe that they have a say in what the government does (OECD Survey of Adult Skills 2023). These facts have obvious implications for the wellbeing of millions of Europeans, as well as the EU’s ambitions to be a democratic, secure and competitive Europe (EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029). The EU’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 commits to “leaving no one behind” (p2). In terms of education and skills, this means putting policy attention on adults who have had very poor educational experiences and now need support to develop their basic literacy, numeracy or digital skills. The Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 specifically states that “we will invest in people’s skills, training and education throughout their lives” (p9). Ironically, adults with low levels of educational attainment are currently the least likely to engage in lifelong learning (OECD Trends in Adult Learning 2025, and SOLAS Lifelong Learning Amongst Adults in Ireland 2025). Their rights are not being realised; and they need to be targeted if Member States are going to meet the target of 60% of adults to be in training by 2030 (European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan). To conclude, we would like to see a strong commitment to a Social Europe in Ireland’s Presidency, with a focus on the furthest behind in education. Ireland is known for its highly educated population, and it was one of only two countries (with Estonia) to increase its level of adult learning between the OECD Surveys of Adult Skills in 2012 and 2023 (OECD Trends in Adult Learning 2025). The land of saints and scholars should continue to lead and to strive for truly equal educational opportunities."

The Roadmap should include lifelong learning of digital skills. We also recommend that the latest version of the European Digital Competence Framework (DigComp 3.0) is integrated into the roadmap and associated guidance/promotions. Advancing existing EU initiatives for inclusive lifelong learning, such as the New European Agenda for Adult Learning (NEAAL) 2021-2030, the Union of Skills and the associated Action Plan on Basic Skills (both 2025). The Irish Presidency should aim to raise awareness of the need for these programmes (with reference to the literacy and lifelong learning statistics discussed under Question 1) and to encourage Member States to embed these programmes in their education/skills policy. European Democracy Shield (2025) – As President, Ireland can promote literacy, numeracy, digital literacy and media literacy of citizens as essential defences against misinformation/disinformation. This could tie in with the Adult Literacy for Life media literacy campaign. Making sure the European Social Fund after 2027 is sufficient, transparent and accessible in practice by civil society organisations. Skills and Lifelong Learning is currently one of the five priority areas of Ireland’s European Social Fund programme, EIST (Employment, Inclusion, Skills and Training) – this should be maintained."

We note that simplification is a central aim of the Commission Work Programme 2026. We propose that simplification is not just about the systems that have to be navigated, but it’s also about the language that is used within them. Ireland could lead by example and put the Commission’s guidance on plain language into practice as President of the Council of the European Union. A “Plain language Presidency” would mean Applying plain language principles to all internal and external communications around the Presidency (policy documents, meeting notes, correspondence, press releases, and so on) Highlighting that Ireland is doing this, and why Challenging other Member States to do the same Connecting with international networks such as the Plain Language Association International Network (PLAIN) or the International Plain Language Federation Sharing learnings from the experience with EU institutions, with other departments in Ireland’s civil service, and so on Keeping good practice going beyond the end of 2026 The benefits of Ireland leading a plain language Presidency include, but aren’t limited to: Better public understanding of Ireland’s Presidency and the workings of the EU as a whole Less risk of misinformation/disinformation spreading about the Presidency Inclusion of marginalised citizens (such as people with literacy needs or whose first language is not English) Smoother, more efficient administration of the Presidency Easier translation into other EU languages"

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefitsharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
87,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a22455b6/Individual_submission_-_Submission_87.docx,,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “peoplecentred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, communityled projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
87,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a22455b6/Individual_submission_-_Submission_87.docx,,,,,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agriinvestors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industryspecific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

Grounded in patient partnership, Ireland should promote three mutually reinforcing thematic priorities: (1) Research-active health systems as a pillar of care for rare diseases. Ireland is well placed to lead a European shift toward integrating research, innovation and clinical trials directly into the care pathway. For rare diseases, research is not optional; it is the mechanism by which new diagnostics, therapies and models of care become possible. Ireland should elevate this as a central European principle: that people with rare diseases must have seamless access to research opportunities as part of routine care, and that healthcare systems more generally embrace research and promote innovation for the benefit of all European citizens and the wider European ecosystem and industrial base. (2) A European framework for timely, equitable access to diagnosis, specialised services and therapies. People living with rare diseases experience systemic inequities driven by fragmented care pathways and inconsistent access across Member States. Ireland should prioritise addressing the diagnostic odyssey, strengthening cross-border networks, ensuring sustainable access to orphan medicines, and advancing a coordinated European Action Plan for Rare Diseases. This framework should commit Europe to reducing unacceptable delays in diagnosis, scaling specialist expertise, improving access to transformative therapies and driving research & development of new innovations across the fields of cell & gene therapies, medical devices, diagnostic tools and data/AI enabled care pathways. (3) Data, networks and workforce capability as foundational enablers. The Presidency should emphasise interoperable registries, real-world evidence, genomic data infrastructures and the long-term sustainability of European Reference Networks (ERNs). Equally, it should promote the need for a highly trained, mobile workforce capable of providing specialist rare-disease care across Member States. These are prerequisites for equitable access, high-quality research and resilient health systems. These priorities reflect Ireland’s strengths in patient partnership, translational science and life sciences leadership. They also align with Europe’s emerging consensus that supporting people with rare diseases is both a moral imperative and a strategic opportunity for European health, innovation and competitiveness."
200,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b1443651/Rare_Disease_Ireland_-_Submission_200.docx,Rare Disease Ireland,NGO,Health,National/EU,2,"From a rare-disease and patient-centred perspective, Ireland should focus its Presidency on targeted initiatives that can deliver meaningful, lasting impact: (1) A time-bound European Action Plan for Rare Diseases. Ireland should seek political agreement to commence and structure an EU Action Plan addressing diagnosis, care coordination, access to therapies, research integration and long-term data strategy. This Action Plan would help reduce current fragmentation and provide a coherent, multi-sector framework for accelerating progress across Member States. (2) Embedding rare-disease priorities within the EU Life Sciences Strategy and regulatory agenda. Ireland should ensure that reforms to clinical trials, regulatory pathways and incentives explicitly serve people living with rare disease. Work should focus on reducing barriers to paediatric and rare/ultra-rare trials, encouraging multi-country clinical trials, adaptive pathways and improving predictability for innovators without compromising equity and safety. driving collaboration and adoption of screening and diagnostic tools to shorten the diagnostic journey for people living with rare diseases, and in particular adopting a standardised approach to newborn screening assessment and recommendation. (3) Strengthening ERNs, workforce mobility and specialist centres. Ireland should pursue Council conclusions promoting the sustainability of ERNs, improving cross-border referral mechanisms and supporting workforce development through training, accreditation and mobility frameworks. (4) Alignment of access and reimbursement mechanisms. Ireland should encourage progress on joint clinical assessments, coordinated HTA processes, joint negotiation and procurement and structured dialogue between industry, regulators, payers and patient groups to shorten delays to treatment access. (5) Delivering interoperable rare-disease data systems and trusted research environments. The Presidency should support deliverables that enable secure, cross-border use of rare-disease registries, genomic data and real-world evidence. This includes defining minimum standards, FAIR principles and conditions for safe data reuse for research and regulatory decision-making. The overarching objective must be to translate political commitments into measurable, near-term actions that advance equity, accelerate innovation and materially improve outcomes for people living with rare diseases."
200,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/b1443651/Rare_Disease_Ireland_-_Submission_200.docx,Rare Disease Ireland,NGO,Health,National/EU,3,"Ireland can maximise impact by grounding its Presidency in the lived reality of people with rare diseases and by promoting cross-sector collaboration that delivers tangible change. First, anchor Council work in deliverables that improve patient outcomes. Measurable objectives—reducing diagnostic delay, increasing research participation, strengthening ERN utilisation—will provide clarity to Member States and industry while focusing EU cooperation on what matters most to patients. Second, champion a whole-of-government and whole-of-ecosystem approach. Rare diseases sit at the intersection of health, research, education, enterprise and social policy. Ireland should model integrated governance by convening ministers and stakeholders across these domains, thereby creating an enabling environment for research and innovation and driving improvements in outcomes for people living with rare diseases. Third, launch practical demonstrator initiatives. Ireland can lead EU-level pilots that provide immediate value to patients while generating evidence for wider EU implementation. Such demonstrators attract investment, reduce regulatory uncertainty and build confidence among innovators. Fourth, mobilise investment and regulatory alignment. By linking regulatory reforms with funding streams across Horizon Europe successors, EU4Health and national programmes, Ireland can help accelerate development of diagnostics, digital tools and therapeutic options. Alignment of HTA processes and cross-border access pathways will reduce fragmentation and support both industry and health systems. Leveraging public/private and public/patient organisation investment opportunities will drive better patient-led innovation and productisation. Finally, embed patient partnership as a cornerstone of policy development. Involving patient organisations throughout the Presidency—policy design, consultations, events and implementation—ensures legitimacy, strengthens outcomes and fosters solutions aligned with real needs. This integrated, patient-centred approach will produce benefits that extend beyond the rare-disease community, improving system resilience, boosting innovation and enhancing Europe’s competitiveness in life sciences."

(1) Lead with lived experience and human impact. Stories from people with rare diseases demonstrate the concrete value of European cooperation—from cross-border specialist networks to coordinated research and improved access to therapies. These narratives make EU policy relevant to citizens. (2) Use patient partnership as a model for wider citizen engagement. Co-designed events, public dialogues and digital consultations—involving patient groups, families and clinical experts—illustrate how inclusive processes strengthen European policymaking and foster a sense of shared purpose. (3) Bring the Presidency to communities. Regional events in hospitals, universities, patient organisations and research centres can highlight Ireland’s leadership while showing how EU action supports local ecosystems: better services, stronger research capacity and new opportunities for young people. (4) Communicate clear, accessible benefits. Messages should focus on what EU cooperation delivers: earlier diagnosis, access to rare disease expertise unavailable in small Member States, the ability to participate in clinical research, and investment that strengthens local health services and industry. (5) Provide transparency through clear reporting. A public Presidency tracker—showing commitments, milestones and progress—will promote trust and demonstrate the tangible value of joint European action. This communication approach, grounded in partnership and lived experience, will strengthen public understanding of the EU’s relevance and foster a deep sense of ownership of Ireland’s Presidency."

As a country with a strong human rights reputation, a commitment to peace and neutrality, and lived experience of colonialism and conflict, Ireland can speak with authenticity and authority on what a values-led Europe should look like. The Irish Presidency of the EU in 2026 represents a strategic opportunity to project a vision of Europe that leans into core values: peace, sustainability, equality, social inclusion, freedom of expression, minority rights, a strong civil society, and accountable democracy, particularly in the digital sphere. The Presidency should focus on high-level priorities that reflect a forward-looking, progressive agenda: Defending and Deepening Democracy - reinforcing democratic institutions, promoting civic participation, and protecting the integrity of elections and digital spaces. Advancing Social Inclusion and Equality - tackling exclusion, racism, and discrimination, and investing in the empowerment of marginalised communities. Protecting Human Rights and Freedoms - safeguarding freedom of expression, minority rights, civil society space, and the rule of law. This moment demands ambition. Ireland has the opportunity to set a “High Water Mark” for the kind of Europe we want to build: one that not only preserves democratic gains but actively strengthens the social, environmental, and civic foundations of the Union.

Erasmus+ and European Education Cooperation Support increased and sustained investment in Erasmus+ within the next MFF to ensure the long-term viability of student and staff mobility, including activities under the European University Alliances. Mobility numbers continue to grow while budgets remain static, forcing institutions to restrict participation and duration of exchanges. Also simplifying administrative processes, particularly for Blended Intensive Programmes (BIPs), would strengthen impact and accessibility. Sustained investment in Erasmus+ underpins the EU’s broader social and democratic objectives by promoting intercultural understanding, inclusion, and collaboration - key values at a time when European solidarity is needed."

Engineering is the backbone of Europe’s economy and innovation, powering sectors from advanced research in ESA, CERN, and fusion energy to everyday manufacturing and high-value industrial systems. For several years the EU and many of its member states have identified engineering as a critical skill with persistent shortages that constrain Europe’s ability to meet its climate, energy, and digital ambitions. A core priority should include targeted efforts to increase female participation in engineering, ensuring gender diversity in the talent pipeline and addressing long-term skills shortages. This engineering theme ensures Europe strengthens its technological sovereignty, reduces dependency on external suppliers, and accelerates the green and digital transitions. A critical element of this theme is sustainable sovereignty, ensuring Europe can meet its climate and energy goals without dependency on external suppliers. By focusing on expanding the EU’s engineering capacity the EU can mitigate geopolitical risks, secure essential technology supply chains (including solar, battery, grid, and digital systems), and deliver resilient infrastructure. Strengthening engineering aligns directly with the EU Green Deal, Net Zero targets, digital competitiveness initiatives, and Industry 4.0 ambitions by ensuring the workforce and industrial base needed to deliver large-scale transformation. Engineering should also be positioned as a driver of innovation in the Agri food sector, ensuring Europe can secure sustainable, climate-resilient food and feed supply chains. This includes enabling advanced processing technologies, energy-efficient production systems, and improved supply-chain resilience. By placing engineering at the centre of its Presidency, Ireland can highlight the link between strategic autonomy, sustainability, and future competitiveness. This focus will reinforce Europe’s leadership in advanced science, industrial capability, and sustainable economic development. Overall, this thematic priority will enable Europe to strengthen its technological independence, support regional economic growth, and ensure that the benefits of innovation and resilience reach all citizens."

The EU’s long-term economic resilience and global competitiveness depend on a strong and sustained pipeline of engineers. As the world faces increasingly complex challenges ranging from climate change and digital transformation to housing and energy security the demand for highly skilled STEM professionals will continue to grow. The EU is well-positioned to meet this demand, but only if it invests in engineering education. Targeted initiatives should encourage female participation in engineering at all levels, including mentorship programmes, scholarships, and awareness campaigns. EU-wide engineering education and skills frameworks with mobility programmes (developing models similar to Erasmus+), will create a unified talent pool for critical sectors. Structured secondment models can enhance knowledge exchange across borders. One identified barrier to the engineering pipeline is lack of understanding of engineering for teachers, the EU must support targeted teacher training to improve STEM and engineering education at all levels and support public awareness campaign to enhance engineering’s appeal and visibility. On the industrial front, legislative proposals must incentivise EU-based production of strategic technologies such as semiconductors, renewable energy systems, and advanced infrastructure to reduce dependency on external suppliers, particularly China and the USA. High-quality infrastructure is essential to both providing a high quality of life for those living in the EU and supporting the growth of the EU economy. There are noticeable delays to infrastructure due to complex regulatory and planning processes. To address this, targeted exemptions from the planning process should be considered for essential public infrastructure that directly support developments identified for the public good. Embedding engineering capability into critical infrastructure and agri-food innovation policies will strengthen Europe’s autonomy, improve security, and resilience against global shocks. The Irish Presidency should aim to deliver a comprehensive roadmap for technological and energy independence, fully aligned with the advocacy work of organisations like Engineers Ireland and Engineers Europe in topics such as innovation, sustainability, and the highest professional standards."

Businesses will benefit from secure supply chains and reduced vulnerability to global shocks, while communities will see tangible improvements through clean energy systems, safer transport, and digital connectivity. While larger countries like Spain, France, Germany, and Italy play pivotal roles in research and development and have benefited from substantial investments. Smaller nations such as Ireland, Denmark and others have had limited opportunities, but possess high levels of capability in STEM. To optimise the skills available across Europe, all member states should be supported to develop capacity and institutions with the goal to foster local innovation hubs in manufacturing capacity including strategic technologies such as Agri-food and solar panels the Irish Presidency can strengthen regional economies and ensure that prosperity is shared across all member states. Crucially, the council should emphasise the high international value of European research programmes and institutions within Europe such as CERN, Fusion for Energy (F4E), and ESA. These initiatives represent Europe’s leadership in advanced science and engineering, from particle physics to fusion energy and space technology. Supporting and expanding participation in these projects will not only drive innovation but also create collaborative opportunities for EU engineers working in English, reinforcing Europe’s technological sovereignty and global standing.

Climate justice Climate change remains the single biggest threat facing humanity. Despite the real and pressing impact on the lives of every EU citizen, it is still not prioritised and treated with the urgency required at EU level. Greenhouse gas emissions across the continent have reduced, driven by reductions in energy, but progress in other sectors such as agriculture and industry has been more limited. Several EU Member States, including Ireland, remain far off track to meet legally-binding climate targets, and analysis from the European Environment Agency shows that even if all current and planned policies and measures were implemented in full across the EU, this would still fall slightly short of the 2030 target of 55% reductions. The recent inclusion of international credits and review clauses in the agreed 2040 target is deeply concerning. Ireland should use its EU Presidency to ensure that climate action is restored as a priority at EU level. We should emphasise urgently closing the emissions gap, delivering on long overdue commitments on climate finance, and taking a strong collective position at the COP31 summit, in line with the core principle of climate justice outlined in the Paris Agreement. (2) Economic Justice Despite record levels of wealth, global poverty persists. Extreme inequality between rich and poor is a defining feature of the modern global economy, in which a handful of powerful companies and individuals possess more economic might than many governments. It is essential that EU policy seeks to tackle, not exacerbate, these asymmetries. Ireland should prioritise coordinated EU action on issues of corporate power and deregulation, sovereign debt, fair taxation and anti-avoidance measures, and reducing inequality. In particular, Ireland should seek to correct the narrative that has sought to justify sweeping deregulation and reductions in environmental and human rights standards across the EU under a guide of “competitiveness” and “simplification”. The Omnibus I process saw the interests of a small number of the world’s largest and most powerful companies prioritised over basic protections for workers, human rights defenders and local communities impacted by abuses in global supply chains. This regressive approach undermines the EU’s credibility and the core values it claims to uphold. The Irish Presidency must work to ensure that EU’s strategic agenda commitment to “respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities” is maintained. (3) Equitable international development and peacebuilding Ireland should emphasise core principles underpinning sustainable development – poverty reduction, civil society space, human rights, gender equality, climate action peacebuilding. This is especially important at a time where the erosion of international law, human rights norms and safeguards is rising. Ireland’s EU Presidency is an opportunity to defend the rules-based, multilateral system and seek to ensure consistency in the EU’s external positions, be that in relation to Ukraine, Palestine, South Sudan or other parts of the world beset by conflict and poverty. It should seek to emphasise the long, hard and essential work of diplomacy, peacebuilding and disarmament and resist a rising tide of militarisation. It should seek to invest in effective, human-rights based humanitarian aid and development work."

Defending the EU Green Deal and climate commitments Ireland should prioritise the completion and effective implementation of key EU Green Deal files, particularly those that remain vulnerable to political dilution or delay. This includes defending climate, biodiversity and environmental legislation that continues to face pressure from a short-sighted, self-harming deregulatory agenda. It should seek to drive progress and maintain a focus on human rights, development and global justice in upcoming Commission legislative files, including (but not limited to) those regarding electrification, heating and cooling; governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action; the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies; investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy; the review of trading practices in food supply systems; the climate package for the decade ahead; the deforestation regulation; and the role of green investment in the upcoming EU budget. 2. A fairer European and global economy Ireland should prioritise EU legislative efforts that have the potential to address inequality, corporate power and asymmetries in the European and global economy, and in particular push back against a short-sighted and harmful deregulatory agenda at EU level. This includes, but is not limited to, mooted ‘Omnibus’ legislation on taxation and antitrust laws; regulation of venture capital funds; shareholder rights and previous work on issues such as beneficial ownership and transparency registers; anti-fraud architecture; and new strategies on anti-poverty and anti-corruption. The EU must take a position in support of a strong UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights, championing the priorities of Global South civil society groups to ensure enforceable corporate accountability, effective remedies for affected communities, and the inclusion of human rights considerations in all corporate-related EU legislation. 3. Global Gateway and external action: Ireland should ensure that the Global Gateway strategy and EU external action more broadly uphold human rights, environmental standards, and democratic values. Civil society in Europe and the Global South has so far had minimal participation, undermining transparency and accountability. The Presidency can lead efforts to embed meaningful stakeholder engagement, public scrutiny, and impact monitoring, ensuring that decision-making is guided by both European and, crucially, Global South civil society. In particular Ireland should seek to draw on its own experiences during the development of a new Middle East Strategy, and seek to ensure that the EU delivers on the obligations outlined in the ICJ Advisory Opinion of July 2024, including a full ban on all trade with illegal Israeli settlements. It should seek to advocate for and defend effective funding for international development and humanitarian aid in negotiations on the next multi-annual financial framework (MFF)."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

Key priorities include: Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (nonlegislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness.

For individuals with serious allergies, policies that improve emergency response, access to medicines, and accurate allergen information can be life-saving. For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives.

Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities.

As the EU places greater emphasis on preparedness and defence, Ireland should draw on its strong tradition of championing IHL at the international and regional level. It can ensure that members states place IHL at the centre of their preparedness and defence planning so strategies center on protection of people as provided for by IHL. Prioritising Access to Affordable and Inclusive Housing The current housing market is increasingly out of reach for many people supported by the Red Cross in Ireland and across the EU. This group includes low-income families, single parents, migrants, people with disabilities, and young people. For migrants in particular, limited access to stable housing heightens the risk of homelessness and social exclusion. Addressing these challenges requires sustained and sufficient EU funding to complement national and regional housing investment. In parallel, EU state aid rules should enable greater public investment and prioritisation of social and affordable housing, allowing Member States and local authorities to respond more effectively to housing needs. As the EU will be launching its new Housing plan and releasing an Anti-poverty strategy in 2026, the priority would be timely. Humane Implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum Commencement of the Irish Presidency aligns with the implementation of the EU Pact on Asylum and Migration. Within the framework of the Pact, reception should be utilised as an enabler for integration. When reception systems are well resourced and inclusive, people seeking asylum can access the services they are entitled to and begin rebuilding their lives with dignity. Community Preparedness In a time of economic pressure, climate instability, and geopolitical uncertainty, community preparedness is vital for a people centred and future oriented Europe. Strengthening community volunteer organisations ensures that citizens are not passive recipients of aid but active participants in their own safety and resilience. Building local preparedness capacities reduces trauma and loss when disaster strikes, enabling citizens and communities to recover faster and with greater confidence — forging a stronger, more secure Europe when it is needed most. Community-Based Mental Health During periods of economic strain and geopolitical uncertainty, the social and psychological resilience of communities becomes as vital as physical safety. Strengthening community based mental health systems, particularly those supported by volunteer networks, helps prevent trauma and promotes recovery after crises. This approach aligns with the EU’s recent emphasis on mental health, including the Commission’s 2023 Communication and successive Council Conclusions calling for accessible, peoplecentred support. By promoting mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) as a core element of preparedness, the Irish Presidency can reinforce Europe’s people-centred and future-oriented vision. Mental resilience is social resilience — and it is fundamental to a stronger, more cohesive Europe when collective stress is at its peak."

As the EU strengthens its preparedness for future armed conflicts, it should ensure policies are in place for the highest level of civilian protection, and that member states implement IHL in times of peace. In EU’s external action, Ireland can play a role in reinforcing EU support for IHL globally. During Ireland’s presidency, the conclusion of the Global Initiative to Galvanize Political Will on IHL will take place. Ireland can encourage member states to support this initiative. Amid rising defence spending and withdrawals from disarmament treaties, Ireland can help ensure that new policies uphold IHL obligations to protect civilians. A people-centered MFF The Irish Presidency should help steer the discussions towards a people-centred Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2028–2034, ensuring solidarity with the most marginalised, fostering meaningful civil-society partnerships, and equipping the EU to act predictably and flexibly amid global and regional challenges. A dedicated forum on the future of cohesion funds could help ensure that forthcoming National and Regional Plans maintain strong social commitments. An inclusive transition out of TPD Since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, Ireland has welcomed many people under the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD). As Member States prepare to implement the Council’s recommendation on transitioning away from TPD, they should address the needs of the most vulnerable - those with no viable pathway to alternative legal status who cannot return to Ukraine due to specific vulnerabilities. This group should be granted access to stable status to safeguard their rights. The Presidency could initiate structured follow-up on implementation of the Council recommendation, including a platform for exchange between Member States and stakeholders. Aligning the EU’s Facilitation Directive with international standards Trilogues around the Facilitation Directive in 2026 will offer an opportunity to prevent undue criminalisation of migrants and humanitarian actors, and reaffirm EU’s commitment to human dignity and solidarity. A mandatory, unambiguous humanitarian exemption should be included to protect humanitarian actors, migrants and their families, and those acting in solidarity. Community Preparedness and Mental Health The Presidency should promote operationalisation of the EU Preparedness Union Strategy by advancing policies that strengthen local voluntary capacities. Streamlined EU funding under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism should be accessible to community and volunteer organisations supporting public awareness, early warning, and civil protection preparedness. Ireland can also encourage integration of community-based actors into cross-border preparedness and response planning. The Presidency could strengthen EU’s work on mental health by promoting the integration of mental health and psychosocial support into EU disaster preparedness and response policies. Building on EU policies, Ireland can encourage EPSCO to prioritise community-based and volunteer-led approaches as essential for early mental health intervention and post-crisis psychosocial recovery. The presidency can support closer coordination between health, social policy, and civil protection frameworks to ensure that mental wellbeing is considered across preparedness planning."

Strengthening compliance with IHL is also essential to safeguarding humanitarian access, ensuring that aid reaches civilians when they need it most. By bringing organisations with operational IHL expertise into relevant working parties (COHAFA, COJUR, PROCIV, etc.), the Council can ensure policies are grounded in operational realities and deliver meaningful protection for people and communities. Housing and Social Inclusion The Council can make a substantial positive impact by improving housing accessibility, including addressing barriers that prevent migrants from entering the private rental market. Strengthening funding for social work and counselling as part of social housing programmes, alongside efforts to combat discrimination, would support inclusion and stability for people and communities across the EU. Reception and Temporary Protection The Council can take a firm stand for a humane implementation of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, ensuring that people are at the centre of the reception system, and that systems are in place to provide safe and supportive environments. Additionally, accommodation must be tailored to individual needs and additional support should be provided to people exiting from reception facilities. In the transition away from the Temporary Protection Directive, alternative legal statuses are considered for the needs of the most vulnerable who may be unable to return to Ukraine. The needs and rights of those who remain must be safeguarded. This work should be advanced across relevant Council bodies, including the Justice and Home Affairs Council and working parties such as the Asylum Working Party, IMEX and SCIFA, to ensure coherent and humane implementation across Member States. Community Engagement The Presidency should prioritise meaningful involvement of community-based actors, people with lived experience, and organisations representing those facing heightened vulnerabilities across all relevant dialogue and consultation fora during the Presidency. Ensuring that these perspectives feed into EU policy debates will help ground EU priorities in lived realities and operational experience. Community Preparedness Directing funding towards volunteer led organisations that specialise in community preparedness produces measurable local benefit. These groups have the trust, reach, and flexibility to engage residents, raise hazard awareness, and mobilise early action. By channelling EU resources through such community networks, preparedness initiatives become more inclusive and effective, especially for vulnerable groups. Sustainable financial support for volunteer driven programmes ensures that preparedness remains embedded at the community level rather than dependent on emergency cycles or institutional capacity alone. Community-Based Mental Health Volunteer led organisations deliver mental health and psychosocial support where it matters most — locally and without barriers. Targeted EU funding for community-based mental health initiatives allows volunteers to reach vulnerable people early, build supportive networks, and reduce isolation during and after crises. Sustained support for these volunteer systems enhances social cohesion, reduces trauma, and directly contributes to recovery, long after formal interventions have concluded. EU investment in these capacities ensures mental wellbeing remains a pillar of preparedness and resilience."

Grassroots efforts calling for peace and IHL compliance, alongside the welcoming of millions of people fleeing armed conflict to the EU, reflects a strong and ongoing desire from European citizens for the EU to uphold values of peace and respect for the rule of law. Persistent non-compliance with IHL undermines confidence in it as a cornerstone of the rules-based international order. Irelands’ values and beliefs must be reflected in the EU, especially as the current geopolitical climate and shifting attitudes towards defence and security risk distancing the EU from these values and from the expectations of the Irish public. Migration The values and benefits of the European Union are reflected in how people seeking protection, or simply a better life in the EU and Ireland, are treated. We need a different narrative on migration, one that moves beyond fear, security, and division, and instead emphasises the added value of intercultural communities across the EU. Community Preparedness Community preparedness communicates empowerment, agency, and shared responsibility — core values of the European Union. It is about communities understanding risks, taking responsibility, and acting together to reduce harm. Public campaigns that highlight volunteer-led preparedness exemplify solidarity in practice, showing citizens that preparedness is not only the role of institutions but a collective European that strengthens both confidence and unity. Community-Based Mental Health Community based mental health fosters empowerment, dignity, and agency. It shows that solidarity is not abstract but experienced person-to-person when volunteers help their neighbours cope, recover, and rebuild. These initiatives demonstrate that preparedness is more than preventing harm — it is about enabling people and communities to take responsibility for their wellbeing and future. Promoting such stories under the Irish Presidency communicates the Union’s human face: compassionate, proactive, and united in care."

We ask the Irish Presidency to support the exclusion of any premature EV fleet mandate for the car rental sector. Our members recognise that the car rental industry shares a responsibility in contributing towards Ireland’s climate action targets. While the industry currently only accounts for 2% of total inbound tourism emissions (ATU ‘Longitudinal study of Tourism Emissions’), we are committed to working with Government and the broader transport and tourism sector to ensure these emissions are reduced, without unintended consequences. To achieve the electrification of the rental fleet in Ireland, it is important that the following enabling conditions are considered: Demand: Overseas visitors currently prefer to rent internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. This is due to a combination of unfamiliarity, charging anxiety, cost, and the already challenging experience of driving an unfamiliar right-hand drive. CRCI members’ data shows that utilisation rates for EVs, i.e. the percentage of time a vehicle is actively rented out, were as low as 24% last year, compared with the 80% required for vehicles to break even. This challenge is being encountered in car rental markets right across Europe, even in trailblazing Norway. Costs: In 2024, the average EV rental cost 33% more than its petrol or diesel equivalent due to higher purchase prices, faster and deeper depreciation, higher maintenance, repair and insurance costs and lower utilisation rates. All these factors increased the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) for car rental companies and hence the cost of rental to consumers. Second Hand EV Demand: Currently, there is a 24% oversupply to the Irish second-hand EV market. This forces additional depreciation on rental EVs, making them even more expensive and less financially viable. It is likely that consumers will have to be incentivised to purchase second-hand EVs, to establish a functioning market for car rental companies to sell their cars into. Charging infrastructure: This remains a major barrier to our EV rollout, with limited coverage in remote regions and tourism destinations, and constrained grid capacity at Dublin Airport, where 83% of Irish tourism car rentals originate. Based on Dublin Airport Authority plans, comprehensive infrastructure suitable for processing large numbers of tourist rentals will not be in place until well beyond 2030. All these challenges can and will be overcome, but the electrification of car rental fleets will only be successful once these enabling conditions are addressed. We call on the Irish Presidency to create an environment where visitors can confidently rent, drive and charge electric vehicles. Imposing mandatory EV purchases on the car rental sector before these enabling conditions are in place would trigger lower fleet purchases and mean that ICE cars are held for longer, ultimately leading to a smaller, older fleet, financial stress on rental companies and the reduction of current visitor levels in rural areas."

These values have shaped Ireland’s approach to public health, digital safety, food standards and innovation policy, and they can offer the Union a unifying direction at a moment of significant social, technological and economic change. Protecting Europe’s Youngest Citizens Ireland has repeatedly demonstrated that strong public-interest policy can coexist with economic success. From world-leading workplace smoking bans to plain packaging and road-safety reforms, Ireland’s instinct has been to protect young people first and build long-term consensus around that goal. Today, Europe faces a similar generational test: adolescents have unprecedented access to high-potency nicotine products, targeted online advertising and emerging addictive designs. The Presidency can place youth protection at the centre of its narrative; a framework broad enough to guide decisions across taxation, consumer safety, digital regulation, food systems and environmental health. Tobacco control remains one of the clearest examples of how Ireland’s experience can support the Union. Ireland has learned that strong prevention measures, coherent taxation and firm implementation of WHO FCTC obligations; including Article 5.3 on protection from industry interference, are critical to reducing addiction and restoring trust in policymaking. This perspective is directly relevant to files such as the Tobacco Taxation Directive and the upcoming revision of the Tobacco Products Directive, where the EU must balance youth protection, Single Market stability and public-health ambition. Strengthening Evidence Integrity Across multiple policy areas, Ireland has developed a reputation for grounding difficult decisions in independent, verifiable evidence. Whether addressing illicit trade in harmful products, regulating digital pladorms, responding to public-health challenges or building financial resilience, Ireland has shown that transparency and evidence integrity are prerequisites for good governance. A Presidency priority on evidence integrity would not single out any dossier; rather, it would help the Council navigate contested files, from health to food to green and digital transitions, with greater confidence and unity. Innovation That Serves Society Ireland’s economic success has long been tied to innovation, but also to an understanding that innovation must strengthen, not weaken, the social contract. As Europe enters a decade shaped by AI, biotechnology and major shifs in food systems, Ireland can help champion a “trusted innovation” approach. This means ensuring AI regulation is enforceable yet innovation-compatible; supporting biotechnology that improves health and food security; and future-proofing agriculture through diversification while protecting farmers’ livelihoods. These priorities align with Ireland’s experience as a consensus-builder and a bridge between technological opportunity and societal protection. Together, these three themes; youth protection, evidence integrity and innovation that strengthens society, reflect Ireland’s identity and offer a compelling, unifying direction for the 2026 Presidency."
178,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/446c2091/Individual_submission_-_Submission_178.docx,European Respiratory Society and The School for Moral Ambition,Individual,Public Health and EU policy,,2,"Ireland’s Presidency should focus on policy areas where it can combine its national strengths with the Union’s strategic needs. Two files stand out as requiring clear, steady leadership: the Tobacco Taxation Directive (TTD) and the next Tobacco Products Directive (TPD). Both carry major implications for youth protection, health systems, enforcement capacity and the Single Market. 1. Tobacco Taxation Directive (TTD) Regardless of the stage the file reaches by mid-2026, Ireland should aim to ensure the Direc1ve delivers coherent minimum rates, full product coverage and genuine youth-protec1on value. Ireland is uniquely posi1oned to help the Council: facilitate agreement if trilogues are ongoing consolidate a Council mandate if nego1a1ons are s1ll open or support finalisa1on and implementa1on steps if the file is close to conclusion. Ireland’s long experience with high excise, strong enforcement and stable revenues gives it credibility to guide Member States through remaining technical and poli1cal challenges, while ensuring robust Ar1cle 5.3-compliant processes. The file is too strategically important for Europe’s fiscal, health and Single Market goals to drif further; Ireland can provide the clarity and momentum needed. 2. Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) revision The upcoming TPD revision will define Europe’s response to rapidly evolving nicotine markets and rising youth uptake. The Presidency should treat this as a priority orientation file if the formal proposal is published before or during Ireland’s term. Ireland can: help the Council frame the core questions around flavours, product design, nicotine limits, marketing, novel products and environmental impacts support consistency with the TTD to prevent regulatory loopholes highlight the evidence base required for proportionate but effective measures. Ireland’s reputation for youth protection and evidence integrity gives it a natural role in shaping an early, balanced Council position. Strengthening 5.3 implementation within tobacco policymaking Within the tobacco context, Ireland can encourage practical steps that reinforce transparency and protect policymaking from commercial interference. This strengthens trust in the evidence base, supports Member States, and improves negotiability of both TTD and TPD. Innovation that protects public wellbeing Beyond tobacco, Ireland should champion trusted innovation across AI, biotech and food systems. Priorities include innovation-compatible AI implementation, safe and future-proof biotechnology pathways, and reducing political barriers to sustainable food innovation while supporting farmers."

Ireland’s Presidency is well positioned to advance three types of impact: protecting health, strengthening trust in policymaking and enabling innovation that serves communities. Delivering strong, coherent public-health measures that reduce long-term harm Substantial impact comes from prevention. Completing or advancing the Tobacco Taxation Directive (TTD) and supporting progress on the next Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) would reduce youth addiction, prevent avoidable disease and ease future pressure on healthcare systems. Clear minimum rates, coherent rules for emerging nicotine products, and processes that uphold WHO FCTC Article 5.3 can deliver benefits felt for decades. This protects families, reduces inequali1es, supports workforce par1cipa1on and helps Member States safeguard public finances. Few files offer such a direct, measurable return. Reinforcing evidence integrity across Council work Ci1zens and businesses benefit when EU decisions are based on independent, transparent evidence rather than compe1ng narra1ves or vested interests. Ireland can embed prac1cal steps that strengthen evidence integrity within the Council’s handling of sensi1ve files. This increases regulatory predictability for businesses, improves trust among communi1es and enhances the Union’s ability to respond to contested issues — from tobacco to food standards, environmental policy and digital regula1on. A Council that communicates and prac1ces evidence-based decision-making has a mul1plier effect on legi1macy and stability. Enabling trusted innovation that creates opportunity in all regions When innova1on is well-regulated and socially grounded, communi1es benefit from new industries, farmers benefit from diversified markets, and SMEs gain clearer pathways to compete. Ireland can use the Presidency to: support smooth, innova1on-compa1ble implementa1on of the AI Act encourage coherent EU approaches to biotechnology that protect health and the environment reduce poli1cal barriers to sustainable food innova1on while ensuring farmers are supported in the transi1on. This combina1on helps Europe stay compe11ve while ensuring that technological change strengthens rather than erodes social cohesion. 4. Deepening the Single Market and free movement Businesses and ci1zens feel the benefits of Europe most clearly when barriers come down: easier mobility, consistent rules and smoother trade. Priori1sing free movement and reducing market fragmenta1on would directly improve opportuni1es across regions. Together, these ac1ons would allow the Irish Presidency to deliver concrete improvements to people’s wellbeing, to business certainty and to community resilience across the EU."

To build a sense of ownership, Ireland should communicate Europe through real stories, not abstract institutions; and highlight where EU action directly protects people, supports communities and creates future opportunities. Show how Europe protects young people The clearest way to make EU membership meaningful is to show how it safeguards the next generation. Whether through safer food, cleaner air, fair digital rules, or reducing youth addiction to harmful products, citizens respond to policies that visibly protect children. Ireland can foreground the Presidency as an opportunity to shape a Europe where young people face fewer risks and more possibilities. This connects directly to key files such as the TTD and TPD, but also to digital safety, environmental standards and consumer protection. Highlight evidence, fairness and trust as European values Citizens are more likely to feel ownership when they believe decisions are made openly and on the basis of reliable evidence. Ireland has a strong history of transparent, consensus-led policymaking. The Presidency can communicate that Europe works when decisions are grounded in fairness and when policy is protected from vested interests; a principle clearly illustrated in tobacco regulation but relevant across all sectors. Tell the innovation story in human terms People want to understand how Europe prepares them for the future. Ireland can communicate Europe as a place where innovation serves society: AI that is trustworthy, biotechnology that protects health, and food systems that support farmers while creating new sustainable opportunities. When people see that EU rules make their lives safer and their work more secure, they feel part of the project. Connect EU membership to Ireland’s national strengths Finally, citizens should feel that Ireland’s Presidency reflects Irish values: fairness, protection of the vulnerable, respect for evidence, and ambition for future generations. Communicating this alignment can turn the Presidency from a technical exercise into something people see as authentically “ours”."

Across these domains, a unifying thread is emerging: the need for public decisions that are transparent, evidence-based and insulated from undue influence. Strengthening this principle would not only improve outcomes in individual files such as the TTD and TPD, but also reinforce trust in the European project more broadly. Ireland is well placed to champion this approach. Ireland’s national experience shows that difficult reforms; whether in public health, digital safety or food standards, succeed when they are grounded in evidence, communicated honestly, and designed with the next generation in mind. As the EU enters a decade defined by rapid technological change, evolving health risks and rising geopolitical pressure, Member States will benefit from a Presidency that can bridge innovation with societal protection and help the Council navigate complex choices with confidence. Finally, the Presidency would be well served by keeping a clear focus on implementation. Citizens experience the EU not through announcements but through the real-world impact of policies. Whether finalising tobacco legislation, strengthening food-system resilience, improving AI governance or reinforcing the Single Market, Ireland can highlight the practical benefits of European cooperation and show how evidence-led policymaking delivers tangible improvements in people’s lives."

Simplification is key – every sector stands to benefit from a streamlining of applicable regulatory frameworks through a reduction in unnecessary complexity and improved efficiency. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council should focus on initiatives that strengthen the EU’s economic resilience and competitiveness, and simplifying the regulatory burden across the EU will be central to meeting those priorities. Fragmented and overly complex rules increase costs for businesses and deter cross-border investment and trade. The IMF describes the frictional cost of doing cross-border business in Europe as if they amounted to internal tariffs. The numbers are striking. Remaining barriers within the single market are equivalent to a 45% tariff on trade in goods. In services, the cost of doing business cross-border in the EU is even higher: the equivalent of a 110% tariff. Innovation and growth should be central themes for the Presidency. Ensuring Europe remains attractive for investment and capable of fostering new technologies and financial solutions is critical. Importantly, these objectives should not come at the expense of financial stability or investor protection. Instead, the challenge - and indeed the opportunity - lies in combining these principles so that regulation supports innovation and growth, while safeguarding market integrity."
198,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/68ad6974/BlackRock_-_Submission_198.docx,BlackRock,,,,2,"Within the remit of financial services, the Presidency should focus on advancing the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) agenda, which aims to deepen EU capital markets and mobilise household savings into productive investments. Four key policy areas stand out: Retail Investor Participation and Advice Framework: Retail investors remain underrepresented in European capital markets, with only 34% of adults investing compared to 58% in the US. The Central Bank of Ireland recently found that just 36% of the Irish population hold any kind of investment product; 5% of the population report they invest in investment funds, yet 10% invest in crypto. 53% of the population reported that they have no exposure to capital markets at all. The Presidency should champion initiatives to grow retail investor participation in capital markets, by simplifying the investor journey under MiFID, notably through the introduction of a simplified advice regime, reducing the perception that investment is just for the wealthy. This initiative would bridge the gap between execution-only services and fully personalised advice, enabling scalable, affordable financial planning for mass-market investors. Simplified advice could help millions of savers become investors, improving financial inclusion and long-term wealth creation. Simplification and Digitalisation of the Investor Journey: Current disclosure frameworks are outdated and paper based. The Presidency should accelerate reforms to PRIIPs and UCITS documentation, making electronic delivery the default and enabling layered, intuitive digital tools. Simplifying disclosures will enhance transparency and investor confidence. These changes will reduce friction and cost, encouraging broader participation. Attractive Individual Investment Accounts and Pension Reform: The Presidency should use its platform to advocate for the rollout of tax-advantaged individual investment accounts across Member States – and should deliver this domestically too. Tax advantages can come in different forms and Member States should not neglect of the attractiveness of tax simplification as an incentive for investors. Designed for ease of use, flexibility, and regular contributions, evidence suggests these accounts could unlock €1.5–€4.8 trillion of EU household savings over 10 years. From an Irish perspective, that estimate is €47-€148 billion over 10 years.6 In parallel, following through on proposed reforms to the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP) to make it fit for purpose through life-cycling strategies, simplified onboarding, and better tax treatment, will strengthen longterm savings and deepen the European investor base. The Irish experience of auto-enrolment can serve as a case study for ensuring pension systems provide better outcomes for all citizens. Reduction of Fragmentation in EU Capital Markets Structure: By focusing on transparency (e.g., consolidated tapes), post-trade efficiency, and harmonised trading rules, the Presidency could play its part in reducing fragmentation and enhancing liquidity. This would make EU markets more competitive globally, lower borrowing costs, and drive economic resilience. These measures will create a structurally deep and diverse investor base, a cornerstone for vibrant EU capital markets and household financial resilience. The ongoing EU securitisation market reforms represent a strategic opportunity for the Presidency to demonstrate leadership in strengthening capital markets and supporting financing for the real economy."
198,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/68ad6974/BlackRock_-_Submission_198.docx,BlackRock,,,,3,"The Irish Presidency has a unique opportunity to deliver lasting benefits by advancing policies that foster more integrated, efficient, and resilient European capital markets. These reforms are far from abstract, they have the potential to translate directly into improved financial wellbeing for citizens, greater competitiveness for businesses, and stronger foundations for communities across the Union. By committing to progressing to the SIU project, citizens, businesses and communities stand to benefit: Building Financial Security and Wealth for Citizens: European households save more than their US counterparts, yet their wealth has grown at only one-third the US rate since 2009. This disparity stems largely from the fact that a significant share of European savings remains in low-yield bank deposits rather than invested in productive assets. The Irish Presidency can help to reverse this trend by accelerating the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) agenda, which aims to make investing simpler, safer, and more accessible. These measures can help empower citizens to invest confidently, strengthen retirement readiness, and narrow Europe’s wealth gap. Unlocking Capital for European Companies: Integrated capital markets reduce the cost of capital and expand funding options for companies. Today, many European corporates are net savers, limiting investment in growth and innovation. In addition to the workstreams underway to increase the supply of capital, the Presidency should ensure that Member States equally champion measures that stimulate demand for capital, ensuring that new savings flow into productive opportunities. Removing remaining frictions in cross-border trade and services will allow firms to scale across the EU’s 450million-person market. Promoting strategic investment in digitalisation, AI adoption, and the energy transition will create pathways for businesses to grow and compete globally. Enhancing private market access – for retail and institutional investors alike - through frameworks like ELTIFs and reforms to Solvency II and IORP would not only offer diversification benefits, but would enable institutional and retail investors to fund SMEs and infrastructure. These steps will attract global capital, create jobs, and position Europe as a hub for innovation. Funding Infrastructure and Resilience: Deeper capital markets can channel resources into projects that underpin community wellbeing such as housing, transport, and clean energy. The Presidency should advance securitisation reform to revitalise this market, freeing up bank balance sheets and expanding lending capacity. Promoting blended finance models can combine public and private capital to accelerate strategic projects, while exploring safe asset solutions can enhance market stability and liquidity. These measures will ensure that capital markets play a central role in financing Europe’s green and digital transitions, supporting local development and resilience. In summary, the Presidency should position capital markets as engines of inclusive growth, helping savers build wealth, enabling businesses to innovate, and funding community priorities. A well-executed SIU agenda will not only strengthen Europe’s competitiveness but deliver tangible improvements in everyday financial wellbeing."

In Ireland, research by CyberSafeKids shows that 24% of 6-year-olds in Ireland [2] and 93% of 8-12 year olds own their own smart device and 71% of this age group have their own social media and instant messaging accounts [3]. The range of online harms includes cyberbullying, exposure to violent, pornographic/ sexually violent material, content promoting eating disorders, self-harm and suicide, misogynistic content, radicalisation, gambling features, unwanted contact, child grooming, sextortion and the promotion and distribution of child sexual abuse material. Europe has taken significant steps to increase protections for minors online, but the measures introduced do not yet go far enough. During our presidency of the EU Council, Ireland must build on recent, encouraging momentum in this area, such as; the signing of the Jutland Declaration during the Danish presidency, the vote in the European Parliament in late November calling on the Commission to enforce the Digital Services Act (DSA) to its maximum, President Von der Leyen’s comments regarding the impact of social media on young people and the calling of an expert panel to make recommendations, the introduction in several European countries of minimum age legislation for access to porn websites and social media and the publication of the DSA guidelines, which serve to strengthen the regulation. Ireland must take a strong, proactive position on this topic and indeed, we have an obligation to do so, given that so many (15/25) of the largest social media platforms are headquartered in this country. Because of this, Ireland will play an outsized role in the enforcement of the DSA on behalf of all Europeans. In the past, Ireland’s regulation of Big Tech has been criticised by many in Ireland and Europe; we have an opportunity now to set the record straight through additional proposals aligned with and complementary to the DSA, as well as demonstrating a wide interpretation and robust enforcement of the existing regulation. Given that Ireland has the highest proportion of young people in Europe and that we have a sad history of failure in always adequately protecting children, we must act with the necessary urgency and commitment to ensure that the safety of minors is always prioritised, online and offline, regardless of the challenges. During Ireland’s presidency we have an opportunity to demonstrate leadership and to achieve meaningful progress towards Europe’s shared goal of ensuring safe, non-addictive digital environments in which young people can thrive. In a time of heightened political polarisation, we believe that the protection of minors online as a priority theme enjoys broad societal and cross-party political support, both in Ireland and across the EU, as evidenced by numerous surveys and the very strong engagement with, and backing for, the Protection of Minors Online proposal in the European Parliament in late November."

A number of member states in Europe have already introduced this, most recently Italy. Ireland should implement this in advance of the development of a harmonised approach by regulators across Europe, as that will take too long the establishment of a mechanism to accredit independent, third-party age-verification technology providers (privacy preserving, such as via zero- knowledge- proof technology), to be made available alongside the government age- verification tool under development; to ensure that further user data is not concentrated in the hands of Big Tech that recommender systems be turned off by default for minors, or be based purely on explicit user signals, rather than implicit signals (such as “profiling”) and that they must never recommend content that, per the DSA, impairs the “the physical, mental and/or moral development of a minor” that platforms accessed by minors undergo yearly, independent risk assessments which determine the appropriate age rating for age-verification purposes, in contrast to the current opaque system of self-assessment classifying AI chatbots as high-risk for minors, under the AI Act, and stipulating a minimum age of 16 to access banning AI-powered “pornify”, “nudify” or deepfake apps that create sexualised imagery without consent.

These rights are undermined every time children go online. The effects of experiencing harmful content or contact can be profound, with some experiencing severe distress, anxiety and emotional withdrawal. Anxiety and depression rates among young people have increased significantly [4] and there is a positive correlation between higher social media use and loneliness, with Irish teenagers particularly lonely [1]. Higher use is defined as 2+ hrs per day; whereas 25% of Irish teenagers spend 4+ hrs and 21% spend 6+ hrs per day on social media [5]) and 64% of 12-15 year olds think they spend too much time online [3]. The consumption of porn is at record levels (regularly viewed by up to 71% of senior cycle students [4] due to ease of access and the deliberate, addicting features of online porn today, with numerous harmful implications for both individuals and society at large. Surveys of Irish parents show that only a small minority feel equipped to help their children manage online risks and about 30% say they never discuss social media use with their children, while in many cases giving them unfettered access (58% can go online whenever they choose, 79% of parents can’t see what their kids do online [2]). For all these reasons, the benefits to young people of better regulation and enforcement cannot be overstated. We believe that the introduction of our proposed measures would bring about meaningful improvements, in terms of young people’s online experiences but also on their mental health and quality of life generally, and would have notable long-lasting, positive effects also for their schools, families, communities, and ultimately all of society. Importantly, the impacts also on businesses operating in this sphere could be positive as there is currently a lack of clarity regarding interpretation of the regulation, too much discretion left to the platforms (which opens the door for legal challenges), a lack of harmonisation in the enforcement regime across Europe and much negative publicity surrounding the industry. Greater clarity, decisiveness, harmonisation and standardisation, all of which would result from the proposals we make above, would ultimately benefit the industry. We welcome recent statements from the government regarding considering a minimum age for access to social media. Any such measure, however, must be mandatory (and no lower than 16 yrs), rather than giving parents an option to allow access (such as between 13-16 yrs) as otherwise nothing will change, i.e. minors will be subject to the same peer pressure and parents will give in to their pleas, as they do now, even though in many cases it is against their better judgement. We would view age verification as just a start on the journey towards safe online environments for young people."

Reports of harm are frequent and widespread. For that reason, “hold-off” and “delay” groups are springing up (here and in other countries), whereby groups of parents in a school agree to not give their child a smart device until, in most cases, the start of secondary school or a year later. These initiatives are much needed because regulation and enforcement have been so lacking. However, holding off, while very welcome, only delays the inevitable problems by a year or two. Frustration and disillusionment with politicians and regulation are on the rise, partly due to concern at increasing levels of regulation without obvious benefits and the sense that our political classes lack decisiveness and a vision. We know that the DSA is a landmark piece of regulation that Europe’s politicians are proud of, and Ireland has its Online Safety Code. However, we believe that if there is not an obvious, significant reduction in online harms experienced by young people, and if these are not felt in the near future, there will be increased levels of frustration and disillusionment with both Irish and European lawmakers and the overall regulatory framework. This could further erode commitment to, and support for, the European project. Additionally, there is a suspicion that Ireland’s government is afraid to stand up to the tech industry here, given their very important contributions to employment and tax revenues, and we note also the Minister’s comments about being disappointed that Europe has not acted more robustly in the area of online safety for minors. However, this ignores the fact that Ireland has the authority to introduce its own minimum age verification, in a way that is aligned with the DSA. Ireland cannot continue to profit from technologies which harm children and must legislate with urgency to address regulatory gaps and meet our obligations under the DSA, with urgency. We believe that lawmakers across Europe, and the Irish government during the presidency of the EU Council, have an opportunity to demonstrate that they are listening to the electorate and taking their concerns seriously. The protection of young people is an emotive issue and close to people’s hearts. It has the power to be a unifying topic. Definitive, meaningful action by Ireland and Europe, regardless of the challenging economic and political backdrop, could help restore the electorate’s faith in the European project, prove that we are stronger when we work together, re-confirm Europe’s commitment to its values and instill pride in our leadership for standing up for what is right, particularly in the context of U.S. attempts to undermine us."

As an honest broker, Ireland is uniquely positioned to champion a whole-of-society approach to this challenge. The Adult and Community Education (ACE) sector, with its deep community roots, is the most effective existing channel for reaching diverse and potentially vulnerable adult populations (including those not engaged in formal tertiary education) who are primary targets of malicious information campaigns. Ireland’s priority must therefore be to professionalise the ACE workforce to become the European Union’s frontline trainers in critical Global Citizenship Education and media literacy. This ensures that the fight against disinformation is not solely a top-down legislative or technology issue, but a bottom-up, empowering educational movement. By focusing on Global Citizenship Education (GCE), which promotes critical, independent thinking on complex global issues, the Presidency would deliver a tangible commitment to strengthening European values—namely, ""freedom, democracy, equality,"" and the commitment to a ""more democratic Union for our citizens"".

This leverages an existing EU framework and aligns with the Strategic Agenda's commitment to ""invest in people's skills, training and education throughout their lives"". Mandate for Quality: The Recommendation should propose an EU-wide standard for mandatory, funded Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for all Adult Learning and Education (ALE) practitioners in the domain of GCE and critical media literacy. This addresses the established organisational requirement for ""meaningful space and time"" and ""funding pathways"" for tutors to engage in GCE courses. Financial Mechanism: Ireland should aim to secure agreement on a proposal for dedicated, ring-fenced EU funding (e.g., via ESF+ or Erasmus+) to cover both the cost of providing the specialist CPD and the cost of paying practitioners for their time to take these courses. This elevates the importance of the ACE educator role. Presidency Achievement: The Irish Presidency is an excellent opportunity to secure a Council consensus and adoption of this recommendation, effectively establishing a common EU standard and resourcing commitment to create a network of skilled educators capable of consolidating social cohesion, strengthening democracy, and addressing the megatrends of misinformation and disinformation, and the concomitant rise of damaging political ideologies at a community level."

The protection and promotion of human rights and equality are at the heart of this and fundamental to any credible rules-based order.

The EU has an opportunity to demonstrate genuine leadership by living up to its own foundational principles in this perilous moment of challenge and change. As a global leader in the field of human rights, for example, Ireland is exceptionally well placed to take the initiative. This is underpinned by the reality of a relatively successful peace process on this island, where there are lessons for Europe and the world, including how peaceful and democratic constitutional change can be made possible. Connected to this overarching vision of Irish leadership, it is likely, for example, that Ireland will be undergoing a process of transition in the decades ahead, as envisioned by the anticipated choice in the Good Friday Agreement. The promise made by the European Council in April 2017 to Northern Ireland - on automatic EU return - retains its power and relevance today. Conversations should be commenced during this time to ensure that whatever happens next on this island is managed responsibly and well.

Organisations (IFRRO)",Non-profit organisation,Cultural and creative sector,International & EU Wide,1,"As Ireland prepares for its Council Presidency in 2026, it has a unique opportunity to advance forwardlooking priorities that reinforce the EU’s competitiveness, democratic values, and cultural identity. A central theme should be the support and empowerment of Europe’s Cultural and Creative Sectors and Industries (CCSIs) in the digital age. The European Council’s Strategic Agenda (2024–2029) highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and heritage as essential elements of safeguarding European values within a free and democratic Union. It also underscores the crucial role of free, pluralistic media and cultural and linguistic diversity. According to the Declaration on the necessity of culture and media as a safeguard for our European democracies, initiated by the Danish Presidency, which has been co-signed by Patrick O’Donovan the Irish Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport, at a time when protecting the resilience of our democracies is more important than ever, the intrinsic value and transformative power of our culture, cultural heritage, and independent media must be fully recognised. These sectors play a vital role in upholding European values and strengthening democratic resilience. The European CCSIs, including the media sector, are central to the EU’s economic and cultural strength. They provide around 17 million jobs and contribute roughly 7% of EU GDP. Beyond their economic impact, these sectors express the heart of Europe’s identity, diversity, and democratic principles. Europe’s longstanding leadership in art, media, and culture has shaped its global influence. Yet this position is increasingly under pressure due to rapid technological change, especially the rise of AI and other frontier technologies, without said change being accompanied by fit-for-purpose legal protections allowing rightsholders to exercise and enforce their copyright and related rights. EU policy must evolve toward a digital environment that is both innovative and fair, one that protects and promotes European creativity. The unauthorised use of large quantities of creative works for AI training and other copyright-relevant AI-related purposes poses real risks for the sector’s sustainability and for the livelihoods of authors, artists, publishers, and other rightsholders. In many cases, creative content has been copied, processed, and monetised without permission or payment, undermining the exclusive rights guaranteed by EU copyright law. This disrespect of EU rules not only threatens the economic foundations of creative professions but also weakens public trust in technology. Ireland could therefore prioritise the theme: “Culture, Creativity, and Fair Innovation in the Digital Era” Under this banner, the Presidency could work to strengthen the protection of authors, artists, publishers, and rightsholders by promoting robust implementation and enforceability of the EU copyright acquis; ensuring full, actionable transparency in content used for AI purposes; promoting licensing; and exploring fair remuneration models when creative works are used by generative AI models and systems. With input from the relevant parties, Ireland could explore incentives and initiatives that motivate tech platforms to engage in constructive discussions with rightsholders, including practical steps such as structured roundtables to identify opportunities for collaboration. It should also look at the full range of tools available to the sector to enforce its rights, extending beyond copyright law (such as the IPRED Directive – Directive 2004/48/EC) to include mechanisms under competition law. By focusing on this theme, Ireland would highlight core EU strengths: its vibrant creative industries, strong digital economy, and global leadership in copyright and cultural policy."

Organisations (IFRRO)",Non-profit organisation,Cultural and creative sector,International & EU Wide,2,"A key priority for the Irish Presidency in 2026 should be strengthening the EU copyright framework to ensure effective protection of authors, visual artists and artist in general, publishers, rightsholders and their creative works in the AI era. As generative AI technologies increasingly rely on large-scale ingestion and reproduction of creative content, the EU must reinforce rules that safeguard creators, preserve cultural diversity and support sustainable media and cultural ecosystems. Copyright is essential for fostering innovation, strengthening competitiveness and protecting our democracy, culture and fundamental values. Ensuring effective enforcement is equally a matter of upholding the rule of law. All of this work should be guided by the long-standing principles of international and EU copyright law. At the core is the three-step test, set out in the Berne Convention and embedded throughout the EU copyright system. Under this test, any exception to copyright must be limited to specific cases, must not interfere with the normal use of a work, and must not unfairly harm the legitimate interests of rightsholders. This remains the key standard for assessing any proposal to broaden exceptions or limitations. The Irish Presidency should make clear that this principle continues to apply to all EU policy developments, including those involving AI, text and data mining, and the digital use of protected content. In addition, the Presidency could assess and further examine the European Parliament’s proposal to establish an irrebuttable presumption that, for any general-purpose AI model or system placed on the Union market, copyrightprotected works and other protected subject matter have been used for training whenever the applicable transparency obligations have not been fully met."

Building on the work of previous Presidencies (the Danish and, before this, the Polish and Hungarian ones), Ireland could organize structured consultations, expert conferences, and targeted questionnaires to collect evidence and perspectives from across Member States and sectors to assess the impact of AI and digital technologies on Europe’s creative and information ecosystems. Ensuring that all voices (large and small businesses, CCSIs, civil society, and academia) are represented will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of EU policymaking and help achieve balanced and future-proof outcomes. Inclusive dialogue would also facilitate a more coherent implementation of existing EU frameworks. While much attention has been given to audiovisual and music industries, the text, image and publishing sectors, including journalism, literature, visual arts and translation, have faced some of the earliest and most profound disruptions. Generative AI is trained and subsequently built upon vast volumes of protected written and visual material, including press content, literary and visual works, often without authorisation, credit, or remuneration. This not only undermines the rights of authors and publishers but also distorts the market by enabling AI-generated content that is often misleading, unverified, and hallucinatory, competing unfairly with authentic, human-created work."

Performers’ Neighbouring Rights","Our primary focus is national, but our work is inherently EU-wide and international.",1,"The Strategic Agenda talks about a free and democratic Europe, a strong and secure Europe that can hold its own in a more confrontational world, and a prosperous, competitive Europe that manages the green and digital transitions, strengthens the single market and supports small and medium sized enterprises and workers. The Culture Compass for Europe sits alongside this and puts culture at the centre of EU decision making. It sets a straightforward test for success: Europe should be the best place to be an artist, which means tackling precarious working lives, rapid digital change and uneven access to funding, backed by investment and partnership with Member States and cultural stakeholders. RAAP supports the submission made by AEPO ARTIS and IMARA on behalf of performers. We do not repeat all of their points here. Instead we focus on issues where Ireland’s experience and RAAP’s role as the Irish performers’ organisation give us a particular angle. Within this framework RAAP suggests three cross cutting thematic priorities for Ireland’s Presidency. First, fair and sustainable digital markets for performers. Streaming and platforms are now the main way people listen to music and watch audiovisual works, yet most performers receive very little from these uses. As a founding member of IMARA, the new global alliance of performers’ collective management organisations, RAAP supports unwaivable equitable remuneration for streaming, strong transparency rules and effective collective management to make “appropriate and proportionate remuneration” real on the ground. Second, a cultural pillar in the EU’s agenda on AI and data. The Strategic Agenda recognises that new technologies bring both opportunities and risks and that Europe should lead in digital industries while holding to its values. The current text and data mining and AI framework does not yet strike that balance for performers. The Presidency should champion an approach where AI developers and platforms cannot free ride on performers’ work but must use properly licensed repertoire under clear rules on consent, transparency, attribution and remuneration. Third, cultural diversity and small markets. The Strategic Agenda commits the Union to promoting cultural diversity and heritage and to strengthening democratic resilience, including through pluralistic media. Ireland is a small music and screen market, with English and Irish language repertoire and a strong live scene. The RAAP v PPI judgment and the Irish legislative reform process show how international rules can affect small markets and performers with less bargaining power. Our aim is fair and sustainable outcomes for all performers, including those from third countries, while avoiding unintended disadvantages for EU performers in the absence of an EU level reciprocity framework. EU digital, AI and trade policies should promote European works, minority language content and local performers. Across these themes Ireland can use its Presidency to join up the Strategic Agenda and the Culture Compass in practice. Strong, independent collective management and unwaivable remuneration rights are tools that help deliver fair pay, competitiveness, cultural diversity and democratic resilience, ensure AI policy serves cultural objectives and advance these goals, not act as barriers to innovation."

Copyright and Related Rights 
Performers’ Neighbouring Rights","Our primary focus is national, but our work is inherently EU-wide and international.",2,"Within this overall framing, we suggest that Ireland’s Presidency focuses on a small number of areas where it can move the dial for performers and the wider cultural ecosystem. Across all of these areas, the Presidency should ensure that performers and their collective management organisations have an effective voice wherever rights and revenues are shared. First, the DSM Directive review, music streaming and fair remuneration. Streaming and platforms are now central to how people discover and consume music, yet most performers see little from these uses. Through EYCS and COMPET, the Presidency should aim for conclusions that assess how the DSM rules on appropriate and proportionate remuneration and transparency are working in practice for performers, invite the Commission to examine unwaivable equitable remuneration for streaming collected by performers’ CMOs, and look at ways to address structural imbalances in bargaining power between performers and large services and right holders. Second, AI, copyright and performers’ rights. As the AI Act and related instruments are implemented, there is concern that existing text and data mining exceptions and transparency obligations do not adequately protect creative repertoire from unlicensed AI training and use. The Presidency should promote a coherent EU approach to AI and copyright that enables practical licensing solutions for the training and use of creative content, makes clear that opt outs and reservations must be technically workable, easy to exercise and respected in practice, and supports a strong EU position in international discussions so that AI systems cannot free ride on performers’ work without consent, credit and remuneration. Third, audiovisual performers, buy outs, Beijing Treaty and term of protection. Recent debates in Ireland on the Finance Bill and the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill have highlighted cross party concern about buy out contracts and forced waivers of residuals, particularly where productions receive State support. At EU level, the Presidency should work to advance ratification and implementation of the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances, open a discussion on the term of protection for audiovisual performers to address the current gap with phonogram performers, and encourage an approach in which State aid and tax relief schemes are aligned with unwaivable performers’ rights and do not facilitate coercive buy outs. Screen sector copyright frameworks, nationally and at EU level, should include performers’ CMOs alongside unions and producers. Fourth, representation, status of the artist and personality rights. Ireland’s experience with joint performer and producer rights in recorded music shows the importance of ensuring that performers have an equal voice wherever rights and revenues are shared. The Presidency should support continued Council work on an EU “status of the artist” that links fair remuneration and contractual protection with social protection, and open a structured discussion on personality rights for performers’ voice, likeness and identity in the digital and AI context, including whether a minimum level of harmonised EU protection is needed. Through these strands Ireland can help turn high level principles on fair pay, cultural diversity and responsible digital leadership into concrete outcomes during its Presidency."

For performers and other creators, fairer rules on streaming, AI and contracts would show up directly in how they work and how they are paid. Better implementation of the DSM Directive and follow up on the Parliament’s work on music streaming would help turn “appropriate and proportionate remuneration” into real money on real statements, not just a phrase in legislation. Performers would be more likely to see a fair share of the value generated on the major services they drive traffic to every day. Stronger safeguards around text and data mining and AI training, backed up by workable opt outs and proper licensing, would mean that a performer’s work is not quietly scraped into AI systems without their knowledge. Instead, there would be clear rules on consent, credit and pay. Work on audiovisual buy outs, the Beijing Treaty, term of protection and status of the artist would support better contracts and more secure residuals, especially for people who currently feel they have to sign away their rights in order to keep working. For businesses, and especially small and medium sized enterprises in the cultural and creative sectors, clearer and fairer EU rules would reduce uncertainty and help them plan. Collective licensing and statutory remuneration schemes can cut down on negotiations and legal costs and give SMEs a straightforward way to comply with EU law. Guidance at EU level on streaming, AI and performers’ rights would make it easier for smaller labels, producers, venues and platforms to operate on something closer to level terms with very large global players, instead of simply having to accept whatever conditions are offered. Aligning State aid and tax relief schemes with unwaivable performers’ rights would also support more sustainable productions. Public support would go hand in hand with respect for performers’ rights, which is better for investors, better for workers and better for audiences. For communities and the wider public, the impact would be felt in the depth and diversity of cultural life across the Union. When performers and other artists can earn a living and are not left behind by digital and AI driven change, local music scenes, independent film, regional broadcasters and venues are more likely to survive and grow. Stronger rules on fair remuneration and AI use would help ensure that the value created by European works is not drained away to a small number of global actors, but supports local jobs, minority language content and a genuinely diverse public space. If Ireland can help the Council join up its work on DSM implementation, streaming, AI, audiovisual rights, cultural policy and the status of the artist, the result should be that fair pay, cultural diversity and responsible digital leadership are not just aims on paper, but things that people, businesses and communities can actually see and feel in their daily lives."

Performers’ Neighbouring Rights","Our primary focus is national, but our work is inherently EU-wide and international.",4,"From our point of view, the best way is to make it real and close to everyday life. If people can see how decisions taken in Brussels show up in their work, their communities and the culture they enjoy, they are more likely to feel that this is “ours” and not just something distant. For performers and other artists, the EU is very concrete. It is there in pay statements, contracts, streaming income and how AI systems are allowed to use their work. For audiences, it is there in what music and films are available, whose stories are told and in what conditions. The Presidency should lean into that and tell the story plainly. First, tell the story of EU wins for artists and cultural workers. Instead of talking only in terms of directives and regulations, explain in simple language how EU rules on fair remuneration, transparency, AI, status of the artist and audiovisual rights are meant to support fair pay, better contracts and cultural diversity. Short, concrete examples will land best. Showing how a specific EU rule has helped a working musician, actor or small producer will do more than general messaging. These examples should come from Ireland and from other Member States, to underline that this is a shared European effort. Second, make performers and other cultural workers visible in Presidency events. Cultural programmes, concerts, screenings and conferences linked to the Presidency should not just showcase work, but also give a little space to the people behind it. Short contributions from performers, unions and collective management organisations explaining how EU rules on streaming, AI, copyright and residuals affect them in practice would help people join the dots. Involving organisations such as RAAP, AEPO ARTIS, IMARA, SCAPR and their members would show that the Presidency is listening to those directly affected. Third, involve young people and future creators. Schools, youth organisations, local venues and regional broadcasters could host Presidency linked projects that look at creativity, work and technology in the cultural sector. Workshops on streaming, AI, copyright and fair pay, developed with artists and CMOs, would give young people space to ask questions and to see how EU decisions shape their future working lives. Simple explanatory material, jointly developed by Irish and EU institutions, could help build understanding and a sense that this is “our Presidency”. Fourth, use the Oireachtas as a bridge. Joint sessions between the relevant Dáil and Seanad committees and the Presidency team, with participation from performer representatives, would help keep the public narrative on streaming, AI, performers’ rights and cultural policy coherent. If TDs and Senators are engaged and confident on these issues, they can help explain to their constituents how Ireland is using its time in the Chair. If people can see that the work done during Ireland’s Presidency helps protect fair pay, cultural diversity and responsible use of technology in the arts, it will be much easier to communicate the value of EU membership and to build a genuine sense of shared ownership."

Performers’ Neighbouring Rights","Our primary focus is national, but our work is inherently EU-wide and international.",5,"RAAP welcomes this consultation and the chance to feed into Ireland’s preparations for the 2026 Presidency. For us, the key is that work on streaming, DSM implementation, AI, audiovisual rights, cultural policy and the status of the artist is not treated in isolation. If these strands are joined up, the Council’s work can add up to a coherent, performer centred agenda rather than a set of separate discussions. Recent Oireachtas debates on copyright, finance and film have already shown strong cross party concern about performers’ rights, equitable remuneration, buy outs and residuals, and clear expectations that Ireland should use its EU Presidency to help deliver fair outcomes at European level. There is an awareness that EU follow up on copyright and related rights, if not handled carefully, could unintentionally undermine reforms now being put in place nationally and reverse hard won gains for marginalised performers. It will be important that the Presidency team is fully aware of this record and that there is a good two way flow between work in Brussels and work in the Oireachtas. In that context, one point deserves particular attention. Equal split provisions for equitable remuneration only really work if the law also makes clear how the performers’ unwaivable right is exercised in practice and who actually collects and manages the performers’ share. When this is left vague, it creates uncertainty for users and leaves performers depending on private arrangements that may not reflect what the legislator intended. Where revenues are collected and controlled by entities that mainly represent producers, there is a built in conflict of interest and a risk that performers do not receive the full benefit of the right. Even if the legal share is equal, decisions on tariffs, costs, distribution rules and dispute handling all shape what performers actually see. For that reason, it would be helpful if Ireland, during its Presidency, could encourage Member States to design systems that reduce these conflicts and protect the performers’ side of the bargain, while respecting the legitimate interests of producers as joint right holders, and to ensure that performers’ CMOs are genuinely representative of and accountable to performers and have an equal voice wherever rights and revenues are shared. Timing also matters. In the next few years the Union will revisit the DSM Directive, implement the AI Act and take forward the Culture Compass and other cultural initiatives. Ireland’s Presidency will sit in the middle of that cycle. There is an opportunity to make sure that work done in EYCS and COMPET pulls in the same direction on fair pay, cultural diversity and responsible use of technology, and that performers’ collective management organisations are properly included in the conversation. RAAP stands ready to provide evidence and experience to support the Presidency team and the Oireachtas. We work every day with performers, users and sister organisations across Europe and beyond, and we see directly how EU rules play out in contracts, income and access to markets, especially in smaller markets."

The latter commit a ‘Quality Jobs Roadmap’, developed with the social partners to support fair wages, good working conditions, training and fair job transitions for workers and self-employed people, notably by increasing collective bargaining coverage and to a Quality Jobs Act. The EU already has the foundation from which to deliver this Roadmap and Act, namely, the implementation of its Adequate Minimum Wage Directive. The ruling on 11th November last by the EU Court of Justice unequivocally confirmed the validity of the Directive’s core provisions promoting collective bargaining, ensuring that the fight for fair wages in Europe continues on firm legal ground. It is clear from this judgement can – and must act – on fair wages and quality jobs. As the Commission’s Roadmap says, access to quality jobs ‘strengthens territorial, economic and social cohesion, allowing individuals to enjoy a “right to stay” and thrive in their local communities and supporting long-term economic participation across regions. This is crucial for Meath which has one of the highest levels of commuting for work in the country. In addition, all EU countries are bound by the European Social Charter, which requires effective mechanisms to ensure fair and adequate wages and to promote collective bargaining. Across Europe economic and social divisions are growing and contributing to social and political destabilisation, as manifested in growing of xenophobia, resurgent far right political rhetoric and sustained attempts to row back on hard-won workers’ rights and rights of minorities.

In such circumstances, the Irish Presidency should aim to do so during its term. We also underline the importance previously announced Commission commitments to a new action plan to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, and the EU housing package consisting of the European Affordable Housing Plan, the review of state aid rules on services of general economic interest in order to better facilitate support for affordable housing and the housing construction. EU-wide progress on affordable homes for all is central to social cohesion and social wellbeing, not least for younger generations who are hit by economic precarity and reduced social mobility. MCTU underline’s its concern that ‘simplification' measures adopted by the EU Council and Parliament across various sectors, aimed at reducing administrative burdens on business and boosting competitiveness, do not undermine the right to collective bargaining, decent work and fair wages.

Moreover, the model of post-conflict partnership across borders, as illustrated by the Good Friday Agreement and the Shared Island Unit, is an aspect that can be shared more universally across the EU, especially in times where geo-political tensions are rising. Given the recent launch of the EU Life Sciences Strategy and Ireland’s pending development of their own strategy in this area, there is a unique opportunity to focus on the theme of Life Sciences Innovation during our Presidency. This would also fit with the wider Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 in respect of development of a more prosperous and competitive Europe. This thematic focus is also timely given the recent launch of the ARC Hub for Therapeutics, which is co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the EU through the ERDF Southern, Eastern & Midlands Regional Programme 2021-2027. Such a focus on Life Sciences Innovation would also provide a platform to illustrate the need for strengthened health cooperation at European levels, as well as the need for appropriate investment in skills, training and education. An area of strength and opportunity that could be highlighted in this context would be Cancer, especially given the context of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan and the EU Cancer Mission. Ireland has shown its ability to act as an international bridge builder in this particular area via the inaugural Joint Euro-American Forum on Cancer (https://euroamericanforumoncancer.org/) held in Farmleigh House on 25th-26th April 2024.

Cancer care offers a compelling lens through which to advance these values because it exemplifies the intersection of demographic change, innovation uptake, workforce pressures and socioeconomic inequality. Person centred cancer care aligns strongly with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024 to 2029, which commits the Union to strengthening competitiveness, resilience and preparedness while improving quality of life for citizens. We recommend a set of interlinked high-level priorities: Delivering people centred services across the life course Ireland’s Presidency can foreground the importance of involving people in decisions about their health journeys and enabling services that are accessible, equitable and responsive. Cancer care provides established evidence on the value of shared decision making, psychosocial support, and the removal of system inefficiencies that compromise patient outcomes. A focus on person centredness also reinforces the EU’s pathway towards better prevention and early detection, key to achieving sustainable health expenditure. Building efficient and sustainable health systems through innovation and data Efficiency should be understood not as cost cutting but as making best use of resources to maximise patient value. Under the next MFF programming cycle, there is a critical opportunity to orient investment towards digital transformation, interoperable cancer data infrastructures, cross border clinical collaboration and evidence generation on real world outcomes. Ireland can champion the principle that efficient cancer care strengthens both fiscal discipline and population wellbeing. Ensuring resilience and preparedness through multi sector and multi country cooperation The Presidency can emphasise the relevance of integrated approaches to cancer and non communicable diseases. This includes addressing workforce shortages, supporting supply chain security for oncology products, strengthening prevention and screening programmes and advancing health equity. Ireland is well placed to steer consensus around implementation of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, drawing lessons from the EU Cancer Mission and the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe. These suggested priorities support a people centred and future oriented Presidency theme and contribute meaningfully to EU competitiveness, cohesion and societal resilience. A critical enabler of efficient, person centred cancer care is the implementation of meaningful efficiency metrics across the full care pathway. All.Can’s research consistently shows that inefficiency remains invisible without reliable, comparable data. Ireland’s Presidency can underline the value of EU level coordination on metrics that capture what truly matters to patients, including time to diagnosis, navigational burden, avoidable delays, quality of life and survivorship outcomes.

Specific areas include: Implementation and future proofing of Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan During Ireland’s Presidency, the Council will likely consider several initiatives linked to the Plan's continued rollout under the next MFF. Ireland can facilitate progress on screening implementation, early detection, inequalities reduction and survivorship frameworks. Clear political commitment to long term financing will be essential. Supporting the next Multiannual Financial Framework with a strong health and research dimension Cancer is a strategic driver of innovation and competitiveness. The next MFF should ensure that EU4Health, Horizon Europe successor programmes, structural funds and digital programmes can continue to support Member State capacity for efficient and person-centred cancer care. Ireland can advocate for targeted investment in data infrastructure, workforce training, health system performance measurement and cross border cancer networks. Lastly, efficiency metrics that reflect patient experience and outcomes are essential for improving cancer care across the EU. Their implementation enables Member States to identify bottlenecks, benchmark cancer pathways, and evaluate the impact of reforms. Ireland’s Presidency is well positioned to advance discussion on standardised metrics and encourage their use in assessing EU funded reforms under the next MFF. Advancing policy related to data use, artificial intelligence and digital health The implementation of the European Health Data Space will require careful Council level coordination. Efficient cancer care depends on high quality data sharing, real world evidence and interoperable systems. Ireland’s Presidency can drive agreement on practical, trustworthy governance frameworks that empower patients and unlock innovation.

Investing in person centred, efficient cancer pathways therefore yields a dual return: improved patient experience and better longterm sustainability. All.Can strongly encourages Ireland to also highlight the importance of EU wide efficiency metrics, which remain an underdeveloped but highly impactful policy tool. Efficiency should be measured not merely in financial terms but through metrics that reflect the full value delivered to patients. These include timely and accurate diagnosis, coordinated care planning, reduction of avoidable emergency presentations, smoother transitions between services, and real-world quality of life outcomes. Doing so would give Member States practical tools to identify waste, reallocate resources and scale best practices. Implementing agreed efficiency metrics across cancer care would significantly enhance transparency, support evidence-based policy and accelerate learning across the Union. We would be pleased to provide further technical input or share evidence from our international work, including insights from our cross-country efficiency studies, patient surveys and multi stakeholder policy dialogues."

This is a matter of particular relevance to the Creative Industries. In this document when we refer to the Creative Industries or Creators we mean writers, songwriters, composers, performers, producers, publishers and all who depend upon copyright to protect their livelihoods and the output of their creative endeavour. ICIF hopes that the Irish Presidency will make copyright protection a cornerstone of its agenda and in particular in the following areas: - 1. Artificial Intelligence & Copyright We are in an era of rapid technology change, including GEN AI and the Creative Industries have a crucial role in fostering the development of smart knowledge-based economies founded on technological innovation with high-value output and based on human creativity and talent. Creative Industries embrace digital innovation and technological change and are at the forefront of recognising that the use of AI responsibly has the potential to enhance human artistry. We hope that the Irish Presidency ensures that EU policy discussions on AI meaningfully address the Creative Industries’ concerns about unlicensed AI training data, usage of copyrighted content, licensing of works for AI, attribution of output, provenance, and remediation for creators and that the Presidency will support existing transparency obligations on AI platforms that train on or generate creative works—requiring: disclosure of the source material used; disclosure of the licences/permissions obtained; disclosure of the terms under which outputs can be used, adapted or commercialised; mechanisms for creators to claim remuneration or control; compliance with the obligation for detailed record keeping – for the creative sectors this means per work level records when intellectual property has been used by AI services and compliance with the obligation to respect rights reservations by rightholders. With a strong regulatory history, a robust presence of technology companies, and thriving sectors where AI is making significant impacts—including music and pharmaceuticals—Ireland is uniquely situated to champion responsible, rights-aware AI development. Ireland should position itself to shape global norms for trustworthy and innovation-driven AI development. 2. The Three-Step Test. The ICIF hopes that the Irish Presidency will make a firm political commitment that any review, interpretation or reform of EU copyright law or the finalisation of the WIPO Broadcasting Treaty will preserve the integrity of the three-step test, and that exceptions or limitations will remain narrowly tailored, respect Creators’ legitimate interests and avoid undue prejudice to their exploitation rights. The Presidency will hopefully resist any proposals that would weaken the three-step test by introducing overly broad or unlimited exceptions, which could undermine investment, threaten Creators’ income and destabilise the creative ecosystem. The ICIF suggests that a dedicated Council working group under the Irish Presidency could review the role of the three-step test in the digital age, assess how exceptions are functioning in practice, and produce guidance or conclusions reaffirming its centrality."
478,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/bff3e70e/Irish_Creative_Industries_Forum_ICIF_-_Submission_478.docx,Irish Creative Industries Forum (ICIF),Representative Organisation,The Creative & Cultural Industries,National,2,"There are a number of legislative proposals that will be a focus of work for the Irish Presidency as follows: The review of the Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market (DSM Review) will occur during the term of the Irish Presidency. This presents an opportunity to ensure that the DSM’s protections are actually working in practice and delivering fair outcomes, that freedom of contract and protection of exclusive rights will be a priority and that no exceptions to copyright law for the use of Text and Data Mining (TDM) will be introduced. In addition, the requirement for a licence agreement with rightsholders for TDM will be maintained. The Irish Government will hopefully ensure that Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (AI Act) is implemented and applied in a meaningful way; that it maintains a commitment to licensing requirements and that it protects copyright; and that the Code of Practice on marking and labelling AI-Generated content is sufficiently robust. ICIF hopes for delivery on the EU Digital Services Act and support for the new infrastructure e.g. the DSC network through member states and at EU level. With respect to the Proposal for Regulation on simplification of the digital legislation (Digital Omnibus package), the Irish Government will hopefully ensure that the simplification of EU digital rules does not modify the core provisions of the AI Act. The current position regarding contract law, whereby platforms and rightsholders negotiate on a bilateral basis rather than any compulsory collective or centralised format should be maintained. Where there are divergences among member states, Ireland is in a strong position to balance these pressures, given the concentration of technology platforms residing here side by side with a prolific cultural sector. Hopefully the Irish Presidency will emphasise that a strong copyright framework is a vital enabler of the Single Market for creative content, cultural assets and digital services and underscore that protecting creators’ rights is not a regulatory burden but an investment in Europe’s creative economy, cultural diversity and global competitiveness. The Presidency might highlight that robust copyright protection helps safeguard Europe’s cultural sovereignty and control over how cultural goods are created, distributed and monetised in the digital age. This should include a focus on meaningful application of existing rules rather than the introduction of new legislation. The Irish Presidency might convene a high-level stakeholder dialogue between Member States’ copyright ministries, the Commission, creative sectors (including Irish Creative Industries), research libraries, cultural heritage institutions and technology platforms. It is vitally important to Creators that the Irish Presidency ensures that any simplification agenda (frequently cited in digital/AI policy) does not erode fundamental rights of Creators or undermine the legal certainty provided by copyright."

It is also a bastion for the protection of its cultural and creative communities. There is a concern that in the race for competitiveness that this will be lost or compromised. One way of communicating its values and benefits , and creating a sense of ownership would be to ensure that any Commission proposal or Member State initiative to reform copyright (including exceptions, licensing, remuneration mechanisms or AI‐specific measures) be subject to a detailed impact assessment on the Creative Industries, especially concerning how it affects creators ’ income, investment incentives and market structure and that any such impact assessment be done with Creators input. ICIF suggests that there should be a concerted effort to host events and initiatives outside of Dublin. A greater focus on the regions would ensure greater awareness of and involvement in Ireland’s Presidency. This would ensure more people and communities have an opportunity to participate in the activities and as a result would have an increased awareness of the EU, its work and its impact on their lives. Ireland’s cultural reputation is known, respected and appreciated throughout Europe and with the Presidency of the EU we have an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the very best of our cultural creativity to an audience way beyond our shores. Every event organised as part of the EU Presidency whether meeting, conference, discussion, exhibition or other should include an opportunity to demonstrate and share the very best of Irish culture and make the Presidency one that is truly Irish and unique in its content."

Europe is entering a decisive decade. The map of power, technology and capital is being redrawn and the countries that can turn uncertainty into momentum will shape the world that comes next. In July 2026, Ireland will take the helm of the Council of the European presidency at a time when the continent stands between eras: recovering from crisis, adapting to AI, redefining its place in a fractured global economy. For Ireland, it will not be a ceremonial rotation. It’s a strategic opportunity to shape Europe’s direction and to ensure Irish diplomacy, influence and pragmatism are felt on the continent’s biggest decisions. Every presidency leaves its fingerprint. We are building on a proud tradition. The reunification of Germany, the introduction of the euro, the admission of ten new member states, and agreement on a continental banking regulator are among the headline moments of the last four occasions Ireland held the presidency. It is against this backdrop that Ireland’s upcoming presidency should be about confidence, the confidence to modernise Europe’s rules, to lead on innovation and to show how smart regulation, unified markets and trusted tech can make Europe stronger Ireland is uniquely positioned to lead a European conversation around three themes: As a digital capital (home to the world’s leading tech firms and the regulators who shape them). As a gateway for investment, connecting European capital to global markets. As a bridge across the Atlantic, trusted in the US, respected in the EU. That combination of innovation, credibility and connectivity gives Ireland a voice that can make Europe work better for citizens, businesses and investors alike. The Presidency is Ireland’s chance to put that voice to work and to move Europe through policy into further progress. Deloitte Ireland sees this as Ireland’s chance not just to chair Europe’s agenda but to shape the conversation around competitiveness in three areas. Responsible AI and Digital trust. Europe’s next-generation resilience strategy through security. Turning untapped investment capital into growth. To understand the opportunity ahead, it’s worth remembering how far we’ve come. The last time we held presidency our priority was recovery. Over a decade later, our task is renewal, not to rebuild Europe’s foundations but to reinforce its future with Ireland at its heart."
391,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d92b2ddb/Deloitte_Ireland__-_Submission_391.docx,Deloitte Ireland,Business,Professional Services,National and EU.,2,"Deloitte Ireland believes that Ireland is uniquely placed to reinforce the inherent strengths of the European Union, and the Presidency of the Council is a precious moment where European values can be furthered. In this way, Ireland has the potential to consolidate and enhance its role as a gateway between the US and EU not only geographically, but geo-politically. One aspect where Ireland can demonstrate this is in relation to balancing the regulatory priorities of the EU whilst promoting the pro-innovation agenda of the US. There are a number of practical measures that could support this which we touch on below. We would also be happy to provide additional practical suggestions as to how this can be achieved in forthcoming engagement with the Government. In responding to this consultation, we are advocating for an approach that maximises impact in a realistic timeframe. We believe that the Irish Presidency should prioritise promoting Responsible AI and Digital Trust. The current EU regulatory environment is complex and dense. We would like to see an Irish Presidency apply the “appropriate instrument” test from the Draghi report on these regulations. This review should see how the framework is working, how clear is the evidence base for the instrument and whether it is providing demonstrable benefit. During the Presidency, Ireland should bring forward a specific strategy to harness the power of AI. This strategy, again in line with Draghi principle of “balance”, should require the 15 designated competent authorities under the AI Act to implement pro-innovation initiatives and to regulate towards outcome based accountability. The Irish Presidency should seek to establish the extent to which there are interagency co-operation for those competent authorities who are responsible for the operation of these regulations, both within Ireland and at the EU level and to drive efficient and effective cooperation between these authorities. The Irish Presidency should also uphold safety and privacy as pre-requisites for the development of AI. This helps to encourage successful adoption of AI by enhancing the trust of society. It has become increasing clear that the EU, both in terms of its institutions and values are experiencing levels of risk, up to and including military risk, at a level which has not existed since the foundation of the Union. We believe that the Irish Presidency should seek to develop a next-generation resilience strategy with security at its core. To prioritise work on the simplification package to boost Europe’s defence industry and readiness. This package is progressing through the European legislative process, and we would like to see Ireland prioritise the ratification process. Ireland should progress initiatives where technology can be developed for a “dual-use” purpose. These are technologies that can be used in a civilian and military (non-lethal/ defensive) applications. Ireland should use its Presidency to foster deeper relationships between the UK and the EU on physical, cyber and social defence mechanisms. There is untapped investment capital into growth (Savings and Investment Union). The groundwork has been set with the Commission’s Competitive Compass, referred to by President von der Leyen as the “North Star” for the Commissions work over the next five years. The savings and investment union is an enabling strategy and seeks to achieve between €750 and €800 billion of additional investments in the EU per year. EU investment funds are 5 times smaller than the US funds and EU stock exchange capitalisation is 73% of EU GDP, 270% in the US and 130% in the UK (https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/market-integration-package_en). We believe that the Irish presidency can help champion initiatives to untap investment capital and to stimulate growth. Developing pragmatic proposals to simplify the securitisation framework, specifically seeking to reducing issuance barriers for European issuers and local investors. In tandem there is merit in preparing proposals to adjust prudential regulation to be more proportionate to the actual risk of each transaction. Prioritise the development of Savings and Investment Accounts (SIA’s). There is a need for a more uniform approach to legislation. EU laws, when transposed into local legislation should be done in a more uniform manner across the EU member states. With the primary intention to simplify and converge supervision rules and implementation, the continued push for a more unified approach as proposed under the capital markets integration package would facilitate the democratisation of investment opportunities and enable funds to trade more seamlessly across national borders. As the proposal seeks to amend over 15 pieces of existing financial services regulatory text, it signals conscious action to a more integrated Union by substantially reducing regulatory arbitrage, potentially replacing fragmented national supervision, and materially lowering cross-border access costs."
391,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d92b2ddb/Deloitte_Ireland__-_Submission_391.docx,Deloitte Ireland,Business,Professional Services,National and EU.,3,"Drawing on the previous answer (see above),we believe that the Council can make the most positive impact by focusing on a small number of files and prioritising those areas where the Council can mitigate risk to the European Union whilst also responding to the challenge as set out in the Draghi report on competitiveness and the Letta report on developing the single market. We understand that the Irish Presidency will have to take input from a number of sources which will feed into the work programme for the Council in the second half of 2026. In making the above suggestions, Deloitte Ireland believe we are remaining consistent with the three transformations ahead for Europe as identified by Draghi: The need to accelerate innovation and find new growth engines. Bring down high energy prices while continuing to decarbonise and shift to a circular economy. React to a world of less stable geopolitics, where dependencies are becoming more vulnerable, and where Europe can no longer rely on others for its security. We should also take advantage of our position, physically, economically and diplomatically as a bridging post between Europe and the USA. Ireland’s Council Presidency and the policy areas we have suggested in answer to question 2 are, given the backing of our Council colleagues, appropriately ambitious and have the potential of strengthening the European Union. Ireland has a proud tradition of achievement during our previous terms of office, and we believe these policies would have the potential to build on that legacy of achievement."
391,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/d92b2ddb/Deloitte_Ireland__-_Submission_391.docx,Deloitte Ireland,Business,Professional Services,National and EU.,4,"Ireland’s Presidency of the Council is an opportunity to re-centre the core ideals that gave life to the European project and to explain their relevance in a world that is becoming more fractured, more volatile and less predictable. The European Union emerged from the devastation of the Second World War as a deliberate answer to a divided continent, built on the conviction that stability and prosperity could only be secured through cooperation grounded in law. Its founding principles are free movement, fair competition, shared standards and institutions designed to resolve disputes peacefully. These were practical safeguards against the return of the instability that had shaped Europe for generations. Communicating these values clearly and confidently is essential today because our global context has changed dramatically. Geopolitical risk has returned, global supply chains are being reorganised, and previous norms cannot be taken for granted. Ireland and Europe have to be deliberate in articulating our values. In the contemporary climate, the strengths of the European model become more visible, predictable rules for citizens and businesses, freedoms that enable mobility and opportunity, and an economic area that amplifies the ability of small countries like Ireland to shape global conversations. These benefits are often assumed, yet they remain central to Europe’s resilience. Ireland’s credibility rests on being outward-looking and trusted on both sides of the Atlantic. The aim should be to emphasise why a strong and coherent EU is in the interests of its citizens and its allies alike. Europe is a rules-based environment where innovation and cross-border cooperation can thrive. Reaffirming these principles helps anchor the Presidency with foundational values; the right to live and work across borders, the protections that come from harmonised standards, and the economic opportunities created by a market of hundreds of millions of people."

Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3.

EMRA recommends that Ireland’s Presidency be guided by four strategic themes, rooted in the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) objectives of healthy placemaking, climate action, just transition, economic opportunity and competitiveness, while also acknowledging the EU’s limited but meaningful role in addressing the housing crisis. Addressing the Housing Crisis While housing remains largely a national competence, Ireland’s Presidency can productively engage at EU level through: Promoting exchange of best practice on sustainable construction, land use management, and public housing delivery models. Supporting EU initiatives on state aid revision, construction sector productivity, skills shortages, and innovation in retrofitting, which directly influence housing supply and affordability. Advocating for targeted use of EU funds to support: energy-efficient renovation, compact urban development, ▪ brownfield regeneration, ▪ sustainable urban mobility. Strengthening Healthy Placemaking and Territorial Cohesion Ireland should champion an EU agenda that places well-being, accessibility, and balanced territorial development at its core. This includes: Advancing cohesion policy reform to ensure that all regions—urban, peri-urban, rural, and transitional— can achieve sustainable, inclusive growth. Promoting sustainable place-based planning frameworks that integrate transport, housing, public services, and nature-based solutions. Prioritising health, liveability, and spatial justice within EU regional policy, recognising the growing evidence linking the built environment to economic and social outcomes. Supporting investment into regional infrastructures that reduces disparities and enhances cross-border and inter-regional cooperation and competitiveness. Accelerating Climate Action and Delivering a Just Transition Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise the implementation of the European Green Deal, with a focus on: Strengthening the Just Transition mechanisms so that regions most affected by decarbonisation—such as former peat-based energy communities—receive targeted support. Promoting multi-level governance approaches that align local, regional, and national climate action. Supporting EU initiatives that embed biodiversity restoration and protection, paying particular attention to the issue of light pollution, climate resilience, and resource efficiency into regional development policy. Highlighting regional experience in aligning carbon budgets, land use, energy planning, and transport systems with climate neutrality goals. Supporting EU Competitiveness Through Regional Innovation and Smart Specialisation Ireland through the Presidency can play a leading role in shaping an EU competitiveness agenda rooted in regional strengths and smart specialisation, including: Advocating for the boosting of EU investment in innovation infrastructures, digitalisation, and skills, especially in sectors such as renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, and the circular economy. Highlighting the critical role of regions in delivering workforce transition, especially through alignment of education, skills, and innovation ecosystems. Advocating for cohesion policy and EU programmes (ERDF, Interreg, Horizon Europe) to remain strongly connected to regional economic strategies, enabling regions to attract investment and participate in strategic value chains. Promoting cross-regional cooperation to support resilient supply chains, research collaboration, and new technology deployment. Ireland’s 2026 Presidency should champion a European agenda that recognises regions as central to delivering climate goals, economic competitiveness, and social well-being. By foregrounding healthy placemaking, just transition, competitive and innovative regional economies, and sustainable solutions to the housing challenge, Ireland can demonstrate genuine leadership during its Presidency."

Ireland should aim to guide negotiations toward an MFF agreement that protects adequate resources for cohesion policy funding while ensuring that regional needs—particularly for rural, peripheral, disadvantaged areas in towns and cities and transition regions—remain central to EU investment planning. Future of Cohesion Policy: The Presidency should work toward a political agreement reaffirming the regional dimension of cohesion policy, resisting pressures to centralise funds or dilute place-based approaches. Ireland can champion flexibility tools that allow regions to tailor investments to local development needs, while also supporting stronger links between cohesion policy funding, Just Transition objectives and innovation-led regional growth. Simplification Agenda: Ireland should aim for a Council outcome that delivers real, practical simplification for everyone involved in cohesion policy—from the Commission to national and regional authorities, intermediaries and beneficiaries. This means pushing for clearer, shared definitions and interpretations across the Commission, Member States and the European Court of Auditors; cutting back on audit and reporting demands; simplifying eligibility rules; and making greater use of proportionate checks. Importantly, simplification shouldn’t just shift the workload from one level to another or make things harder for a particular part of the system. It should genuinely reduce complexity across the whole delivery chain. The aim is a simplification package that offers more legal certainty, applies rules more consistently, and cuts unnecessary administrative hurdles while still protecting good financial management. Climate Agenda: Given the centrality of the green transition to all EU funding programmes, the Presidency should focus on progressing outstanding climate-related legislation and ensuring coherence across sectoral initiatives. Ireland can position itself as a broker, promoting strong climate ambition while ensuring that obligations remain practical, properly funded, and responsive to different regional starting points. This means advancing key climate legislation and aligning related EU policies, so the green transition is effective and manageable for all regions. Economic Competitiveness in Regions: The Presidency should promote a policy agenda that strengthens regional competitiveness by supporting innovation ecosystems, smart specialisation, SME productivity, digitalisation, skills development and infrastructure connectivity. A key objective should be to ensure cohesion and competitiveness policies reinforce each other, enabling regions to adapt to structural change and participate fully in the green and digital transitions."

This requires ensuring that legislative discussions consistently reflect the realities of Europe’s cities, regions and rural areas, and that the insights of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) and local and regional authorities (LRAs) are actively integrated into Council deliberations. Stronger stakeholder voice EMRA calls on the Irish Presidency to prioritise open, structured dialogue with civil society, businesses, social partners and regional actors throughout the legislative cycle. Early engagement, particularly on legislation affecting territorial development, cohesion, climate transition and competitiveness—will help ensure that proposals are shaped by those closest to their implementation and impact, resulting in more effective and broadly supported legislation. Elevating the role of LRAs and the CoR The Presidency can highlight the crucial role of the Local and Regional Authorities (LRAs) in delivering EU objectives on the ground by encouraging their systematic involvement in the development of national positions and promoting strong multi-level governance practices. The respect of the subsidiarity principle and making sure that decisions are taken at the level closer to the citizens will ensure the Presidency has a higher impact for all. Greater visibility for the Committee of the Regions’ (CoR) opinions in Council debates—especially on cohesion, green transition, regional innovation and public service delivery—would enhance the quality of deliberations. Ireland can also foster deeper cooperation between national delegations and CoR workstreams to strengthen institutional channels for territorial expertise. Outcomes for communities and businesses Embedding territorial perspectives and strengthening stakeholder participation will help produce legislation that is proportionate, implementable and responsive to diverse local conditions. This approach supports better public investment, serves to strengthen regional competitiveness, improves service delivery and ensures that EU policies deliver tangible and equitable benefits across all regions. Stronger involvement of LRAs will also enhance the delivery of EU competitiveness, climate and resilience objectives by ensuring that legislation is designed with practical implementation in mind. By integrating territorial realities and CoR expertise, the Council can help ensure that EU legislation and investment deliver stronger results in every region, contributing directly to the Strategic Agenda’s goals of a resilient, fair and competitive Europe. Our call to the Irish Presidency We urge the Irish Presidency to champion inclusive and transparent governance as a means of strengthening the Union’s capacity to deliver on its major strategic priorities—green, digital, industrial, security and territorial cohesion. Decisions taken during the Presidency should translate into practical, positive outcomes for communities and businesses across the Union. We also call on the Presidency to support structured opportunities for civil society, social partners and economic actors to contribute early and meaningfully to the work of the Council."
232,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/beac6ebb/Eastern_and_Midland_Regional_Assembly_EMRA_-_Submission_232.docx,Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA),,,,4,"To communicate the values and benefits of EU membership and foster a genuine sense of public ownership over Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the most effective approach is to connect EU principles directly to people’s everyday lives. This involves clearly highlighting the Union’s core values—solidarity, democracy, sustainability, regional cohesion, and shared prosperity—while demonstrating, through relatable and concrete examples, how EU policy and funding positively shape communities across Ireland and the wider Union. Communicating EU values and benefits Ireland can help citizens understand the Presidency not as a remote institutional responsibility, but as a platform for influencing Europe’s direction in ways that matter locally. The latest Eurobarometer, published September 2025, shows that the EU is regarded as a place of stability, with 73% of Europeans stating that their country has benefited from membership. Communicating Ireland EU Presidency’s role in advancing the EU priorities—such as climate action, regional development, digital innovation, and social inclusion—through clear, accessible storytelling can strengthen trust and foster a deeper sense of belonging to the shared European project. Expanding outreach beyond traditional policy audiences is essential. Cultural initiatives, partnerships with local authorities, targeted social-media engagement and community-level dialogues can extend the message into everyday civic spaces and ensure that communication reflects the diversity of society. The Presidency’s platform can be harnessed to reach young people, rural communities, disadvantaged areas in towns and cities, migrants, and other groups less likely to feel connected to EU institutions. It can be the vehicle to enhance transparency and promoting two-way dialogue by inviting citizen input on EU priorities. Citizen panels, participatory workshops, or regional deliberative events during the Presidency can give people a sense that their views actively shape Europe. Draw on Ireland’s positive experience with EU membership (economic development, peace and cooperation, rural regeneration, rights protections) provides practical, positive experience. Present Ireland as a proactive, constructive EU member sharing its strengths—particularly in areas like sustainability, digital policy, and conflict resolution. Communications should avoid institutional jargon and instead highlight personal stories, before-and-after examples, and community voices. Showing tangible impact The Presidency communications should place strong emphasis on real, visible examples of EU investment that resonate with citizens. Initiatives such as the recent Just Transition Fest in Castletown Geoghegan, Co. Westmeath, highlight how EU support delivers regeneration, innovation, and community vibrancy at local level. Showcasing outcomes—such as job creation, enhanced public services, strengthened cultural offerings, and environmental improvements—helps citizens see the EU not as an abstract institution but as a practical partner in shaping their community’s future. A concerted effort to safeguard and articulate the principle of justice in the delivery of a Just Transition is essential for building trust among communities directly or indirectly affected by transition measures. Transparent communication on fairness, inclusion, and long-term local benefits will be central to securing public confidence and buy-in. This emphasis, reinforces and aligns with the Commission’s social model goals of ensuring that “no one is left behind”."
232,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/beac6ebb/Eastern_and_Midland_Regional_Assembly_EMRA_-_Submission_232.docx,Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA),,,,5,"Regional Assemblies are Ireland’s EU–National–Local Interface Regional Assemblies are the statutory link between EU, national and local governance. They operate at the intersection of EU and domestic policy through EU programme management and communication (ERDF, JTF, Interreg, URBACT, EUI), spatial planning, and work with the Committee of the Regions. Strengthening their role in shaping the EU Presidency would ensure a programme grounded in lived territorial experience and informed by structures already interfacing with the EU. Strengthening Democratic Governance and Subsidiarity A Presidency grounded in LRAs would model multilevel governance, demonstrating democratic accountability, subsidiarity and policy coherence. Ireland’s comparatively weak regional tier makes this especially important. Effective delivery of the EU Green Deal, climate legislation, the biodiversity strategy, circular economy actions and cohesion policy depends on regional/local implementation, including: Alignment of local authority plans with carbon budgets, the Climate Action Plan, biodiversity targets and SDGs. Councillor oversight of spatial planning, infrastructure and land use. Local delivery of active travel, compact growth, public realm projects, climate action and Town Centre First— all aligned with EU urban and cohesion policy. Enhancing Democratic Legitimacy and Addressing Structural Challenges A Presidency shaped with strong regional/local inputs increases Ireland’s credibility in leading EU climate, cohesion and territorial agendas. LRAs are increasingly recognised by the EU as essential democratic actors. At the same time, Ireland’s major challenges—housing, population growth, infrastructure deficits, climate adaptation— are regional in scale. Fragmented delivery structures (NTA, TII, Uisce Éireann) often weakens alignment with EU obligations. LRA involvement improves coherence and reinforces democratic legitimacy. Supporting EU Cohesion Policy and Transition Priorities The EU Presidency will be expected to address cohesion policy, the Just Transition Fund, and future EU budget frameworks. Ireland’s Regional Authorities already manage major EU programmes and hold critical insight into how EU investment translates into regional development. Their involvement would strengthen Ireland’s negotiating position and ensure policy lines reflect real delivery experience. Strengthening Delivery of EU Legislation Upcoming EU obligations—Fit for 55, Energy Performance, Nature Restoration, Green Infrastructure, water and digital directives—depend on regional/local implementation. Spatial planning, climate action, infrastructure coordination and biodiversity restoration all sit at LRA level. A Presidency informed by LRAs ensures Ireland can articulate a credible, coherent national position across these files. Advancing EU Urban and Territorial Agendas The EU increasingly emphasises urban partnerships, smart regions and functional urban areas. Town-focused bodies can engage directly with initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative (EUI) and URBACT. EMRA’s experience as the National Contact Point for both of these programmes has highlighted that European partners benefit from town- or region-level structures. Strengthened LRA involvement positions Ireland as a leader in urban and territorial cohesion policy. Demonstrating Commitment to European Democratic Standards Ireland will be scrutinised during its Presidency on subsidiarity, governance quality and regional engagement. Strengthening Regional Assemblies, enhancing transparency and aligning with the European Charter of Local SelfGovernment will demonstrate Ireland’s commitment to European democratic norms and effective territorial governance."

Promoting and protecting democracy necessitates a range of actions including addressing economic inequalities, the cost of living crisis, people’s access to decision makers, the workings of the EU institutions, but this submission focuses on aspects related to migration, specifically promoting democracy by: Strengthening civil society Addressing harmful misinformation and hateful narratives on migration in both deed and action Improving social cohesion Strengthen civil society as protectors of democracy and EU values Civil society organisations (CSOs) amplify the voices of and defend the interests of vulnerable people in our political and policy making processes. As such, they are essential to a well functioning democracy. In order to carry out this function, civil society must be properly resourced. This means that EU funding should not restrict CSOs’ ability to advocate for human rights including towards the EU institutions. In too many EU countries, civil society actors including lawyers and humanitarians are being criminalised for their work with migrants including refugees. (see reports below). Ireland must protect the freedom of CSOs working with migrants. Combat harmful and false narratives on migration to protect the EU from anti-democratic forces Harmful narratives on migration, often based on misinformation, have propelled political forces that are anti-democratic. It is not possible to promote democracy in the EU without moving away from and addressing harmful framings of migration. Therefore, an integral part of protecting democracy is to not mimic these narratives but to instead work with people on the move, CSOs, academics and experts by experience to combat these framings and to tell the positive stories of migration that people are living all over the country and continent every day. The implementation of the proposed Democracy Shield must protect a vibrant and free civil society in the EU and fight misinformation with a focus on the role of tech companies and their responsibilities regarding the spread of anti-democratic and hateful content. Provide leadership on fighting the erosion of democracy Ireland can show leadership by using the Presidency as an opportunity to stop framing migration as a security threat. Movement of people, even irregularly, does not pose a threat to the safety of Europeans yet this reality is too often ignored. Framing migration as a security threat has contributed to the rise in anti-democratic forces within the EU. Ireland's presidency proposal should echo the language used by Spain in their presidency proposal which focused on ‘humane, responsible, compassionate’ policies. Language choice contributes to framing and signals intent. Ireland should show leadership by joining with like-minded member states to host an event in Brussels on the positives of migration and the need to combat harmful narratives. Aimed at perm reps, EU agencies and EU policy makers this would be a step towards protecting democracy in the EU. Any migration policy that erodes human rights and is not fully committed to international law is a threat to democracy. As such, all migration policies negotiated at EU level must embody a meaningful commitment to protecting human rights and non-refoulement for all people who come to and cross EU borders. As president of the Council, Ireland will be promoting democracy by chairing policy negotiations in this manner."

Any discussion of potential expansion of the standing corps must also include mechanisms to hold Frontex to account. This is particularly important for upholding EU values and democracy in light of accusations of Frontex involvement in breaches of EU and international law. Accountability mechanisms should ensure FRO’s recommendations and opinions are followed up within a specified timeline and that Parliamentary scrutiny of Frontex is enabled. Frontex activities outside the EU must be limited given accountability is harder, risks are greater, and the purpose of operations remains opaque and dubious. Civil society and the EU Ombudsperson must be meaningfully consulted during the negotiations on the proposal on Frontex’s mandate. Multiannual Funding Framework Migration related spending must not be directed to border management at the expense of asylum and inclusion. Social cohesion goals must be prioritised and adequate funds allocated to integration measures. Safe and Legal pathways Mission letters to Commissioners, including Commissioner Brunner, re-commit the EU to achieving the SDGs. Ireland should use the Presidency to work towards SDG indicator 10.7.2, “Number of countries with policies to facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people”. Explore legal pathways for people seeking international protection. The Strategic Agenda commits to ‘explore the opportunities of migration, including through legal pathways’ and ‘break the business model of those who profit from’ smuggling as well as ‘consider new ways to prevent and counter irregular migration.’ Ireland’s presidency should use the JHA council to discuss how the way to achieve the EU aim of ‘breaking the business model of smugglers’ is to provide legal ways to enter the EU, thus removing people’s need to turn to smugglers. Considering new ways to counter irregular migration must be in line with EU values, international law obligations and the rule of law. Ireland should therefore show leadership in steering member states away from ‘solutions’ that involve a derogation of human rights obligations including return hubs, the informal but well established use of pushbacks and opaque deals with third countries. Instead, Ireland should promote humanitarian visas, expansion of visa schemes, resettlement and other legal pathways. Regarding implementation of the EU Asylum and Migration Pact, the Irish Presidency must focus on ensuring that all Member States uphold and respect the fundamental rights of people seeking asylum in the EU. This should include: Ensuring full adherence to the Pact’s regulations and directives. The Pact lays a floor, not a ceiling, for Member States’ asylum systems, and failure to comply with EU laws will further erode the European public’s trust in asylum systems. Ensuring effective access to asylum procedures. No person should be obstructed from accessing a territory or asylum procedure which may, in certain circumstances, result in that person being returned to a country where their life or freedom may be threatened, breaching the international principle of non-refoulement. An accessible asylum procedure is vital to uphold the Union’s values of democracy, human rights and solidarity. Ensuring fundamental rights monitoring bodies are fully independent of the asylum authorities; have a wide remit; and are properly resourced. An effective and independent fundamental rights monitoring system is preventative, as it reduces the risk of fundamental rights violations, improves transparency and accountability, and enhances trust in public authorities. Ireland’s term as president should aim to ensure that policies which affect the most vulnerable people in European society, including those seeking protection, are fundamental rights compliant. Protecting vulnerable applicants: It is important that special reception needs and special procedural guarantees for vulnerable applicants are safeguarded when the Pact is transposed as national level. Identifying This will help deliver a system which protects the most vulnerable people."

Irish Penal Reform Trust",Group of NGOs:,"Migration, International Protection, Human Rights",National and EU-wide.,3,"At a time of significant polarisation, it is imperative that the Council works towards improving social cohesion among all communities whilst improving public confidence in Member State’s asylum systems. These are not achieved by reducing rights for people seeking protection but by encouraging and resourcing integration initiatives and effectively communicating the democratic values underpinning our asylum systems. Foster integration: It is more important than ever that all communities are encouraged and resourced to integrate. Research shows that communities which come into contact with migrant populations see their attitudes towards migrants significantly improve. This benefits migrants, host communities and social cohesion among Member State’s populations. Ireland can use its role as President to encourage positive integration initiatives. Support social cohesion: Restricting asylum applicants to reception centres or limited geographic areas is likely to severely limit their ability to effectively integrate with host communities, including in access to healthcare, employment and educational opportunities. It also limits opportunities to meet their community, to volunteer and get involved with local groups. Restrictions of movement can paint an unfairly negative view of asylum systems among host communities, likely creating a psychological link between asylum and crime, and keeping communities apart. Freedom of movement allows people to meet their community and take part in civic life. Combat mis/disinformation: Communities are intentionally being driven apart by anti-migrant and far-right actors. Ireland can play a crucial role in limiting the voice that these actors have. Often, misinformation originates outside of the EU and does not represent the views of ordinary EU citizens, yet it is influencing their views and perceptions of vital democratic and EU institutions. It also plays a huge role in shaping EU citizens views on migrants and people of colour, and is partly responsible for the surge in racism seen across the EU. Proactively limiting the impact of misinformation should be a priority of the Irish presidency. Recognise that Migrants are vital to the economy in Ireland and across the EU. Migrant labour keeps our healthcare, hospitality and tech industries running. Yet, people seeking asylum are heavily restricted in their access to the labour market. Allowing asylum applicants to work from shortly after they apply for asylum allows them to contribute and give back to their host communities, as many of them are so keen to do. This benefits asylum applicants- many of whom will receive permission to stay and build lives in host communities- by preventing loss of skills and helps local businesses suffering from labour shortages."

A disconnect between what the EU says (upholds values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law) and what it has been found to do in some cases (violate human rights in policy and practices) undermines belief in EU values. Closing this gap by making policies that respect human rights, and ensuring that the practices of EU agencies such as Frontex respect human rights, communicates the values of EU membership. A sense of ownership over Ireland’s Presidency of the Council as well as membership of the EU will be achieved in tandem with increasing social cohesion. Given the cost of living problems that people in Ireland face, divisive rhetoric and actions that seek to blame the members of our communities who have migrated to Ireland, undermine social cohesion.

The European Commission on Racism and Intolerance, Sixth report on Ireland Has noted that: There are also recent documented examples of politicians’ reactions to events in local communities resulting in illinformed responses, fuelling hate speech and escalating tensions further. ECRI recommends that the authorities step up their efforts to encourage public figures, such as high-level officials, politicians … to take a prompt, firm and public stance against the expression of racist and LGBTI-phobic hate speech, react promptly to any such expression with strong counter-speech and alternative speech, and express solidarity with those targeted by hate speech. Available at: https://rm.coe.int/sixth-report-on-ireland/48802911ef ESRI, Community context affects attitudes towards immigration: Research found that more segregated areas (i.e. where migrants live in clusters rather than evenly spread across the area) show more negative attitudes towards immigration. This also suggests that positive social contact with migrants in communities may facilitate understanding. The research suggests that positive social contact can play a key role in improving attitudes and therefore social cohesion. The findings about pressure on services indicate that it may not be direct local experiences that impact attitudes, but may instead be concern about pressure on services in Ireland as a whole. Research available at: https://www.esri.ie/news/community-context-affects-attitudes-towards-immigration Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Human Rights Survey 2025: Found that: 80% of people agree that everyone should be treated equally regardless of who they are or where they come from, this belief is diminishing annually – from 85% in 2023 and 84% in 2024. Though the key support level remains high, this negative trend is a clear cause for concern. Asked about efforts to combat discrimination in Ireland, only four in ten people believe they are effective. That speaks to a crisis of confidence in our institutions and political leadership, and also indicates a level of concern about the direction our society might be moving in. 14% of respondents said they experienced racism in the past year, up from 10% in 2024. Among non-white Irish, the figure rises to a shocking 66%. Two in three non-white Irish people have directly experienced racism in just twelve months.

Given the tight deadlines imposed to co-legislators for Omnibus I, the European Commission could aim to conclude both files by the end of 2026. Based on Ireland’s involvement in the D-9+ Group, the Irish EU Presidency should continue to push for further regulatory simplification in the digital area, which is also on the Commission’s agenda as part of the digital fitness check. Transatlantic relations: Following the EU-US Framework Agreement and the Joint Statement issued in the summer of 2025, the EU has an opportunity to follow up with the US and build cooperation in critical areas such as: removing barriers to digital trade; negotiating a Mutual Recognition Agreement in Cybersecurity; strengthening cooperation and alignment on economic security issues (e.g. export controls, critical raw materials, semiconductors). In the EU, Ireland is the second largest exporter to the United States after Germany. 53.7% of Ireland’s extra-EU exports went to the US in 2024, which is the highest across Member States. With this unique position, and based on historic ties with the US, Ireland is well positioned to act as a bridge between the EU and the US. Balancing Digital sovereignty with openness to international partnerships: Recent months have shown renewed interest in digital sovereignty in the European Commission and across some Member States. Following the European Digital Sovereignty Summit in November, we are expecting a series of connected policy developments on digital sovereignty in the beginning of 2026: the review of the Cybersecurity Act, the legislation underpinning the EU Cloud Security Certification Scheme (EUCS), which is expected to be reanimated early 2026; the Digital Network Act in January 2026; the review of the 2030 EU Digital Decade targets, and the release of the Cloud and AI Development Act, which will likely come with a non-binding recommendation to use European Cloud Services in the public sector. In this context, the Irish EU Presidency should ensure that sovereignty does not mean protectionism and that the EU remains open to cooperation and collaboration with international partners sharing common values."

Environmental Omnibus (expected Dec 2025): This should help create a unified market for waste and recycling, for example by maintaining green-list status for non-hazardous intra-EU e-waste shipments beyond 2027 and promoting greater harmonisation of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regime. Regulations on durability—such as the Right to Repair—should clearly differentiate between B2C and B2B ICT products to address the unique needs of enterprise solutions.

Cloud and AI Development Act (March 2026): This should stimulate the buildup of AI and Cloud infrastructure by favouring a flexible approach that balances the needs for Europe’s infrastructure and the demand for sovereign solutions in specific use-cases. The proposal should clarify the need to ensure the resilience and security of cloud and AI infrastructure, by stimulating the uptake of AI security solutions that protect the infrastructure, and the development and deployment of AI. Additional measures on ICT supply chain security and Trusted Vendors would strongly reinforce digital resilience.

Review of the EU Digital Decade Targets (2026): This should: 1) Drive investment into critical digital infrastructure capacities, notably in secure and energy efficient networks to prepare to become an AI continent; 2) Ensure public sector leads by example by investing in state-of-the art digital infrastructure and key technologies such as AI; 3) Boost the uptake of advanced AI, digital and cyber skills to secure the talent needed to develop, deploy and harness key digital technologies; 4) Allocate necessary funding in the future MFF (EU budget) for European SMEs to grasp the benefits of AI and Cloud technologies, and reduce red tape when trying to access the funding. Public Procurement Act (expected Q2 2026): The Presidency can initiate Council discussions on the proposal at the end of 2026. The Commission has repeatedly called for the inclusion of European preference criteria in the revised Public Procurement Directive. That would restrict choices for the European public sector, without necessarily producing the intended impact of local growth and jobs. This would also lead to higher costs and generate issues for bidding companies with highly integrated supply chains who may not be able to meet proposed local content requirements. Instead, the EU should aim to use a Trusted Partners List, including companies from allied countries with a strong business footprint in the EU. Implementation of the EU Defence Transformation Roadmap: The EU has identified capability gaps for European defence, including in areas like AI and cyber. As the EU implements the roadmap to boost innovation in the defence industry, it will be important to adopt commercial off-the-shelf best-of-breed technologies as the default, from a trusted international market, and to avoid introducing European preference criteria for the allocation of dedicated EU funding. Implementation of the EU International Digital Strategy: Next to the implementation of the EU-US trade framework, the EU should strengthen its digital partnerships with key partners through an agenda that fosters economic security innovations, supports joint deployment of secure AI-powered infrastructure, enhances global gateways for secure connectivity, establishes frameworks for data access requests and cross-border data flows, bridges the global talent gap with digital and AI skills, reinforces supply chain resilience, and advances energy security and clean innovation. ICT Supply Chain Security Toolbox: Steps to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure through the imminent Toolbox would be welcome, including in giving guidance to Member States on the use of trusted vendors in critical networks. The Presidency should look to progress any such measures."

This includes dairy exports valued at €6.3bn produced by our co-operative members. Dairy farming remains our largest indigenous industry with over 17,000 dairy farmers. Dairy farming is exposed to fluctuations in global markets which means that those farmers face great uncertainty in 2026. Irish farming has proved its resilience in the past, but this cannot be taken for granted into the future and so requires the full attention of government in ensuring that global shocks, geopolitical tensions, fluctuating markets and unpredictable weather events do not threaten the vibrancy of the sector. Ireland enjoys a positive reputation globally as a food producing country. Our grass-based system gives us a great advantage in terms of protecting animal welfare and maintaining relatively extensive farming systems. There is a golden opportunity during the Irish Presidency to harness the positive image of Irish farming and food production and the huge economic contribution which our 120,000 farm families and co-operatives make to the rural economy. At a time where rural depopulation is an issue across Europe, the Irish Presidency can showcase how rural economies can continue to withstand the threat to rural areas by spotlighting the tremendous role which the Irish agrifood sector plays in ensuring vibrant rural areas and businesses. Investing in the future is key to supporting the future vibrancy of Irish food production. That brings us to the burning issue of young farmers. A generational renewal crisis in farming is happening not only in Ireland but right across Europe. Recent reports on this crisis have just been published at national and EU level. The Irish government must use the EU Presidency to prioritise this emergency by implementing proposals to tackle this very worrying trend. Approximately 6% of EU farmers are under the age of 35. Young people are leaving rural areas to pursue other careers due to the lack of certainty about the future of farming because of red tape and bureaucracy which is a unrelenting from the EU Commission. The Irish Presidency can lead the way in showing a real commitment to the future of farming across the EU by fast-tracking solutions and implementing recommendations from the recent reports on generational renewal which will make farming attractive as a viable career for younger people. They would like to farm but are prevented from doing so because of policy, access to land, access to finance and a lack of start-up supports among many other issues. Food security can only be cemented if there is a pathway for the next generation of farmers."

Without this, farmers and co-ops cannot prosper, and the three pillars of sustainability (economic, social and environmental) will collapse consequently. Farmers are on the front line in the face of climate change and yet it is our farmers and co-operatives who are doing the heavy lifting daily to implement EU policies under the EU Green Deal. Farmers and co-operatives are working hard to meet their climate change targets and improve water quality with hundreds of millions of euros invested in schemes and in R&D to meet climate targets. That work is continuing at pace. But this will be undone if the financial support is not there to make this happen quickly. The EU has unveiled a series of omnibus packages in 2025 with the aim of simplification of legislation. But we are not seeing any simplification, moreover, the daily work of farmers and co-operatives is being strangled by new layers of legislation and policy which in many cases is unworkable and unnecessary. Farmers and co-ops need to see simplification in action in order to be able to plan ahead. The Irish Presidency must make simplification happen by the end of 2026. EU farmers employ the highest standards in the world as things stand when it comes to sustainable food production. This can only continue with proper supports and sensible policy. The EUs Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is an example of another layer of well-intentioned EU Commission policy with unintended consequences for farmers and consumers. At a time when the cost of living is hurting citizens in Ireland and across Europe, keeping the cost of food at an affordable level for hard pressed consumers is imperative. But now because of the CBAM which includes fertiliser, the cost of fertiliser could increase by as much as 50% by 2030. There is little doubt that this would impact on food price and impact on Irelands climate targets as the cost of protected urea would price farmers out of the market. We have called for a postponement of CBAM and will continue if necessary to fight against this food tax throughout 2026. This is not only and Irish concern but a concern for farm and co-operative organisations across the EU."

This includes increasing their purchasing power, creating good jobs, and assuring the quality of goods and services including a sustainable and resilient agricultural sector. The council during the term of the Irish Presidency must prioritise and support the role of agricultural co-operatives and the contribution they make in terms of social, environmental and economic prosperity in rural areas not only in Ireland but right across the EU. ICOS is the umbrella organisation for the co-operative movement in Ireland – including dairy processing co-operatives and livestock marts – whose associated businesses have a combined turnover in the region of €16 billion, with some 175,000 individual members, employing 12,000 people in Ireland, and a further 24,000 people overseas. In total, there are some 1,000 co-ops in Ireland, and the largest 100 organisations employ approximately 40,000 people. Irish Co-operatives are progressive locally focussed businesses which adhere to strict corporate governance rules. Their continued robustness can only be assured by a recognition of the role they play in supporting farmers and businesses mainly in rural areas which are under constant pressure because of rural depopulation. However, the future viability of co-operatives is under pressure from overly burdensome “one size fits all” legislation and policies. For example, the well-intentioned EU Unfair Trading Practice proposal to impose mandatory contracts on dairy co-operatives is unnecessary in an Irish context and does not consider the well-functioning milk supply agreement contracts already established in Irish dairy co-operatives. Meanwhile the proposed drastic cut in the CAP budget under the recently announced MFF would inflict a sizable blow to farming and food production and in turn impact on co-operatives and livestock marts. The Council must ensure a fully funded and workably structured and ring-fenced CAP in the next MFF to underpin its commitment to ensuring food security across the EU. While cognisant of the EUs commitment to bolstering security and defence, it should not come at the expense of European farmers, co-operatives and rural dwellers. Recent Eurobarometer findings show an overwhelming support among Irish and EU citizens for the Common Agricultural Policy and the role it plays in ensuring safe, traceable, affordable food. The Council must listen to its citizens and cite these findings as good reason to guarantee a well-funded well-structured CAP which benefits consumers alongside food producers."

Achieving these objectives requires addressing the growing divergence in national approaches to TPLF, a sector now recognised as a cross-border economic and legal risk. The UK’s experience is instructive. When the UK’s opt-out regime was introduced in 2015, government assessments anticipated limited scale. Instead, within a decade: more than 708 million class members were aggregated across claims (CMS Class Action Report 2025); over €155bn in damages were claimed (CMS); the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal received one new collective action per week (CMS); Independent economic analysis from ECIPE estimates that mass litigation could cost up to £18 billion in economic costs, including reduced innovation, lower capital investment and heightened risk profiles for regulated sectors (ECIPE - The Impact of Increased Mass Litigation in the UK, 2025). This experience shows that once profit-driven mass litigation models take root, they rapidly become structurally embedded through financial incentives, funder capital cycles and procedural norms, making reversal or meaningful reform extraordinarily difficult. The EU therefore has a narrow preventive window. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise: 1. Reducing regulatory fragmentation in TPLF through EU minimum harmonisation. Strengthening economic resilience by ensuring that civil justice mechanisms promote, rather than deter, investment and innovation. Protecting consumers and SMEs from predatory or speculative litigation models that offer minimal real-world redress. Building trust in justice systems through transparency, accountability and proportionate oversight. The overarching aim should be to prevent the emergence in the EU of a litigation environment that mirrors the UK’s experience - a system characterised by escalating claims, limited consumer benefit, and growing macroeconomic implications."
204,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f6186f78/Fair_Civil_Justice_-_Submission_204.docx,Fair Civil Justice,,,,2,"FCJ fully supports EJF’s call for an EU level instrument regulating TPLF. FCJ’s additional evidence shows why the UK’s trajectory makes this a matter of urgency. In our recent submission to the UK Department for Business and Trade’s review, we submitted evidence demonstrating that the UK opt-out regime is now extremely costly, of questionable social utility, and primarily serves to enrich lawyers and litigation funders. Funders’ success rates approach 90%, reflecting a structural imbalance that incentivises the pursuit of high quantum claims with low evidential thresholds. Parallel analysis by Kendal Global Advisory (see here) shows that major employers now treat mass litigation as a board-level strategic risk, influencing decisions on capital allocation, new product launches, regulatory engagement and long-term UK investment. Based on this evidence, Ireland should steer Council discussions toward: 1. A Minimum Harmonisation Directive on TPLF Core elements should include: transparency obligations on funding agreements; restrictions on funder control of litigation strategy; conflict of interest safeguards; proportionate financial soundness requirements; an EU register of funders; annual reporting requirements and oversight mechanisms. 2. Complementary guidance on Representative Actions funding To prevent funders shaping redress mechanisms toward profit maximisation rather than consumer outcomes. Evidence-generation tools The UK experience shows the consequences of insufficient monitoring. EU-level annual data collection on funder returns, consumer compensation levels, settlement structures and economic impact would enable early policy intervention. Preservation of access to justice A regulated funding framework ensures that TPLF supports legitimate claims while preventing the pursuit of low-merit, high-aggregate-value actions that inflate legal costs and undermine judicial effectiveness. The UK’s inability to contain the unintended consequences of an initially narrow litigation reform demonstrates the need for preventive action at EU level, rather than reactive national remedies after systemic issues have crystallised."
204,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f6186f78/Fair_Civil_Justice_-_Submission_204.docx,Fair Civil Justice,,,,3,"The Council can deliver significant impact by enhancing legal certainty, ensuring fair access to justice and supporting economic competitiveness through coherent regulation of TPLF. Evidence from the UK shows that TPLF-backed mass litigation fails to deliver meaningful benefits for consumers. Participation and distribution rates are extremely low: In Justin Gutmann v. First MTR South WesternTrains Ltd, which settled pre-trial, less than one per cent of the £25m settlement has been claimed by class members. This is despite alleged efforts to inform those affected through advertising and the media. The claimant law firms and funders stand to receive 50 times more than consumers, underscoring the point that these types cases often benefit funders and lawyers over consumers. In Merricks v Mastercard, which settled in early 2025, the settlement Sum was £200m - less than 1.5% of the initial claim value (£14bn), reflecting that the settlement reached was ""very far from a success"" according to the Judge. Consumers are expected to receive as little as £2.26 in compensation (Law Society Gazette). UK-wide polling by Kendal Global Advisory shows only 8% of adults believe have ever been involved in a class action, despite hundreds of millions of people being automatically included in claims without awareness. This demonstrates that mass litigation, without safeguards, does not provide substantive consumer redress. For businesses, the economic consequences are substantial. Litigation costs, provisions, higher insurance premiums and increased cost of capital act as de facto regulatory burdens. Major firms report that mass litigation now affects decisions on where to invest, whether to launch new products and how to engage with regulators (Kendal Advisory, Institute of Economic Affairs). Communities and workers are indirectly impacted through reduced investment, slower innovation and diversion of resources away from productive activity. Public services have also become targets of mass claims, redirecting funds away from core service delivery. An EU-level framework for TPLF would: promote predictable legal environments, supporting cross-border investment; ensure consumer trust through accountable redress systems; protect regulatory cooperation, which is increasingly disrupted in the UK; reinforce economic security by preventing litigation driven risk inflation."

By acting early, the EU demonstrates foresight, accountability and a commitment to delivering outcomes that genuinely benefit people. Communicating that the EU has learned from the UK experience - and is acting to prevent similar systemic issues - will resonate strongly with citizens. Showing that EU action protects consumers from exploitation and businesses from economic uncertainty strengthens trust in EU institutions. A Presidency narrative grounded in fairness, transparency and proportionality will underscore the EU’s role as a guardian of both consumer welfare and economic stability."
204,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f6186f78/Fair_Civil_Justice_-_Submission_204.docx,Fair Civil Justice,,,,5,"The experience of the United Kingdom offers important lessons for EU policymakers as they consider how best to manage the growing role of TPLF and mass litigation within the internal market. FCJ’s analysis across multiple UK sectors indicates that once profit-driven litigation models become embedded in a legal system, the dynamics of the market make them extremely difficult to reverse or recalibrate. Three cross-cutting insights are especially relevant for Ireland’s Presidency: 1. Policy intent can diverge rapidly from policy outcome. The UK’s opt-out collective action regime was introduced with narrow objectives and modest expectations regarding claim volume, complexity and economic impact. Within a few years, however, the regime grew far beyond those projections, with very large class sizes, increasingly speculative claims and escalating litigation costs. This demonstrates that even well-designed procedural reforms can produce materially different real-world effects when combined with commercial litigation funding and entrepreneurial claimant practices. The distribution of financial outcomes is highly asymmetric. Despite the rhetoric of consumer redress, FCJ’s assessment of UK cases shows that consumers frequently obtain only minimal individual compensation, while funders and lawyers capture a disproportionate share of total recoveries. At the same time, businesses - many of which are major employers and long-term investors - face unpredictable, high-quantum exposure. This asymmetry raises questions about fairness, efficiency and the sustainability of a litigation model that prioritises investment returns over redress outcomes. Once mass-litigation incentives take hold, course correction becomes difficult and costly. The UK Government is now examining potential reforms, but any meaningful recalibration must contend with established financial structures, ongoing litigation, entrenched market expectations and the political sensitivity of altering a regime framed as consumer-protective. This underlines a critical point that preventive, proportionate regulation of TPLF is far more effective than attempting to redesign the system once large scale commercial incentives are entrenched. These insights strengthen the case for EU-level minimum standards that ensure transparency, independence, financial soundness and accountability for TPLF operators. They also reinforce the importance of monitoring litigation trends, economic impacts and consumer outcomes across Member States, something the UK lacked in the early years of its regime, contributing to the scale of today’s challenges. Ireland’s 2026 Presidency has an opportunity to advance a coherent and future-oriented EU approach that protects consumers, supports regulatory effectiveness and preserves Europe’s competitiveness."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (nonlegislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally.

The prevalence of serious food allergies and anaphylaxis is increasing across Europe, placing a growing burden on individuals, educational settings, workplaces, and public services. Addressing these conditions aligns closely with broader objectives to safeguard citizens’ wellbeing and to reduce preventable health risks. 1. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The European Union must be adequately equipped to respond to emergencies, including acute health incidents, natural disasters, and public safety threats. Achieving this objective requires harmonised emergency response systems, strengthened preparedness at community level, and enhanced cross-border cooperation. Ireland is among the few Member States that have implemented concrete measures to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, notably by allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription in cases of anaphylaxis. This national practice illustrates effective emergency readiness and offers a valuable model for EU-level policy coordination. It could inform forthcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at reinforcing preparedness, prevention, and rapid response capacities across Member States. 2. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not overlooked. The Presidency could advance efforts to reduce health inequalities across the Union, drawing attention to disparities in access to diagnosis, specialist care, treatments, and emergency response protocols. Framing timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda would demonstrate a commitment to tangible, measurable improvements in patient safety and social inclusion, while upholding citizens’ right to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare facilities, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation provides a strategic opportunity to promote digital innovation in health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of severe allergic reactions, seamless cross-border access to relevant medical information can prevent emergencies and facilitate the free movement of people. The Presidency could also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional preparedness, and capacity-building initiatives, ensuring that schools, businesses, and public institutions are adequately equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

In this context, the following priority areas could be highlighted: 1. Strengthening Public Health Safety and Crisis Readiness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis constitute an increasing public health concern across Europe. During its Presidency, Ireland could: Promote timely and equitable access to emergency medicines, ensuring that all individuals at risk can receive prompt and effective treatment. Encourage harmonised preparedness measures in schools and public venues, drawing on Ireland’s experience as a model of good practice. Relevant forthcoming EU initiative: Global Health Resilience Initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026), aimed at reinforcing the EU’s capacity to respond swiftly and effectively to health emergencies. 2. Advancing Digital Solutions for Emergency Healthcare Effective management of cross-border emergencies requires seamless and secure access to patient information. The Presidency could therefore: Support the implementation of the European Health Data Space to enable interoperable and secure sharing of health data, facilitating faster responses to anaphylactic events across Member States. Promote digital, citizen-centred health tools that enhance patient safety and improve the effectiveness of emergency responses. 3. Promoting Equity, Inclusion and the Protection of Citizen Rights Ireland’s Presidency could also contribute to ensuring fair access to emergency care and reinforcing a rights-based approach to health policy by: Linking emergency preparedness to the strengthening of the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and the Citizens’ Omnibus initiative (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring effective protection of children in schools, childcare facilities, and community settings. Advancing intergenerational equity through the Intergenerational Fairness Strategy (non-legislative, Q1 2026), so that preparedness and access to healthcare benefit both present and future generations. Showcasing Ireland’s approach as a practical and replicable model for other Member States. Strategic Objectives Establish a coherent framework for EU-level coordination on anaphylaxis management and emergency response, building on Ireland’s best practices. Guarantee equitable access to life-saving treatments throughout the European Union. Foster digital innovation to improve preparedness, information exchange, and cross-border continuity of care. Reinforce citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring that public health policies are grounded in principles of social equity. Consolidate health resilience as a central pillar of citizen safety and social cohesion, delivering tangible improvements in public health preparedness. By prioritising these focused actions, Ireland can use its Presidency to achieve concrete and measurable progress in citizen safety, health equity, and cross-border emergency preparedness, while simultaneously strengthening the EU’s social and legal foundations."

For individuals living with serious food allergies, policies that enhance emergency response systems, ensure timely access to medicines, and guarantee accurate allergen information can be decisive in saving lives. From a citizen perspective, expanded access to emergency treatments—including the availability of pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the European Union—would significantly improve everyday safety. People with severe food allergies would benefit from stronger protection in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and while travelling across borders within the EU. For economic operators and businesses, harmonised requirements on food allergen labelling and staff training would reduce regulatory fragmentation, facilitate compliance, and increase consumer confidence by contributing to safer public and commercial environments. At the level of communities and public institutions, EU-supported preparedness measures—such as shared school protocols, guidance for public venues, and widely accessible training programmes—would substantially decrease the incidence of preventable emergency situations. Extending and replicating Ireland’s best practices in access to emergency medicines across Member States would ensure that life-saving interventions are available when and where they are most needed, reinforcing a more resilient, safer, and more inclusive European Union."

Through its 2026 Presidency, Ireland can demonstrate how European cooperation protects individuals, strengthens communities, and enhances daily safety, particularly in areas such as emergency preparedness for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. 1. Making EU Solidarity Visible Through Concrete Outcomes Citizens engage most effectively with the European Union when its impact is translated into clear and relatable results. Ireland can therefore highlight EU values by illustrating how cooperation contributes to improved safety and wellbeing, for example through: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport systems, and other public spaces. Shared health information frameworks that make travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised food allergen-labelling rules that ensure consistent consumer protection across Member States. More reliable and equitable access to emergency support in cases of severe allergic reactions. 2. Advancing Council-Level Action on Emergency Preparedness To reinforce public understanding of the EU’s practical benefits, Ireland could take the lead on a visible, citizen-focused initiative by promoting Council Recommendations on preparedness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. Such an initiative would encourage Member States to: Strengthen readiness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure the availability of trained responders across a wide range of community settings. Address and reduce inequalities in access to time-critical, life-saving care. This type of action is readily understandable for citizens, delivers direct safety improvements, and illustrates EU cooperation in a concrete and human-centred manner. 3. Reinforcing a Clear Narrative: Europe as a Protector of Citizens By highlighting initiatives that make everyday life safer—such as enhanced emergency preparedness for severe allergic reactions—the Irish Presidency can convey a clear and compelling message: EU cooperation produces real and practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. Adopting this people-centred narrative would help strengthen public trust, foster a sense of shared ownership, and demonstrate in concrete terms the value of Ireland’s leadership at European level."

It directly supports the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029’s first pillar: “Protecting citizens and freedoms.” True protection comes not only from physical defence but from actively reducing the drivers of conflict and championing the tools of peace. As a state without the “war baggage” of historical empires, with a proud record of UN peacekeeping and international aid, and a population that consistently supports neutrality, Ireland is the best-placed Member State to credibly and energetically advance this agenda. The Presidency should leverage Ireland’s moral authority to refocus the EU’s immense resources and diplomatic power towards sustainable peace, demonstrating that diplomacy is not a sign of weakness, but the ultimate form of strength."

This should be a cross-cutting priority, particularly within the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and General Affairs Council (GAC). Specifically, the Irish Presidency should: Promote the “Irish Peace Process” as a Diplomatic Template for Active Conflicts: The Good Friday Agreement is a globally recognised model for ending entrenched conflict. The Presidency should actively advocate for similar frameworks of inclusive dialogue. For example, a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia was reportedly close in April 2022 before diplomatic efforts were abandoned. The Irish Presidency should champion the reopening of such channels, arguing that the alternative—an endless cycle of escalation and slaughter—is unacceptable. The EU’s role should be that of a persistent peacemaker, not a weapons supplier. Ireland's Presidency must confront the EU’s profound hypocrisy and moral failure regarding Palestine. The Union cannot credibly claim to be a ""global champion of human rights"" while providing the military, economic, and diplomatic cover for Israel’s genocide in Gaza and its ongoing, violent occupation of the West Bank. The Irish Presidency must therefore lead the call for an immediate, comprehensive EU arms embargo on Israel and the imposition of targeted economic sanctions. These are not optional measures; they are the bare minimum required by international law and basic humanity to halt the slaughter and dismantle the structures of apartheid and occupation. It is only when the cost of perpetual war and illegal settlement becomes untenable for the Israeli state that a genuine, just, and lasting peace—based on equality and an end to occupation—becomes possible. The glaring double standard, where the EU swiftly sanctions Iran, Russia, and others while granting Israel impunity for far greater and more systematic violations, destroys the Union’s standing and must end. Ireland, with its historic solidarity with oppressed peoples, is uniquely positioned and morally obliged to make this demand. Champion and Resource EU Civilian Peace-Building Capabilities: While military mobility and defence are on the agenda, the Presidency must ensure equal, if not greater, political energy and funding is dedicated to the EU’s civilian Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions, mediation support, and humanitarian diplomacy."

The current path of accelerated militarisation—evidenced by the EU SAFE Plan and the repurposing of Cohesion Funds for defence—undermines social cohesion, accelerates climate collapse, and betrays the EU’s founding ideals of peace and reconciliation. The war in Ukraine and the genocide in Gaza are stark testaments to the catastrophic failure of a militarised, non-diplomatic approach. Ireland, guided by Article 29 of our Constitution, has a historic duty and a unique opportunity to change this trajectory. We must offer the EU a different choice: to become a leader in peacemaking, using its power to convene, mediate, and resolve rather than to arm, sanction, and prolong conflicts. We propose that the Irish Presidency Programme explicitly includes an objective to “Strengthen the EU’s institutional commitment to, and capacity for, proactive peace diplomacy and conflict resolution, applying the principles of inclusive dialogue—as exemplified by the Irish Peace Process—to current crises, and ensuring climate and social justice are central to the EU’s concept of security.” This would be a legacy worthy of Ireland’s history and a vital service to humanity."

As an island nation, Ireland relies heavily on UK interconnection for gas supply. Decarbonisation and energy transition Ireland should lead efforts to accelerate the decarbonisation of the gas network, prioritising biomethane and hydrogen integration while streamlining permitting procedures for energy projects. These actions support the EU’s climate neutrality goals and reflect the European Commission’s commitment to clean energy. In parallel, Ireland could use its Presidency to drive innovation in energy infrastructure and digitalisation, ensuring momentum behind the Cloud and AI Development Act, expected in Q1. Energy security and resilience Ensuring secure, reliable, and resilient energy supply is paramount. Ireland’s reliance on UK gas infrastructure presents unique challenges, particularly regarding access to EU funding for projects located in third countries. The Presidency should advocate for eligibility reforms in EU funding mechanisms e.g., Connecting Europe Facility, alongside enhancements to the EU Energy Security Framework, to encourage investment in key infrastructure projects vital for gas security of supply. Affordability and competitiveness The Action Plan on Affordable Energy and Competitiveness Compass are central to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme. Ireland should prioritise policies that reduce energy costs for households and SMEs, promote market reforms, and support the development of indigenous renewable energy sources. This will enhance Ireland’s competitiveness and help stabilise prices ensuring least cost, efficient, secure and clean energy for all citizens. Commitment to customer-focused solutions such as enabling flexible, decarbonised energy pathways for those for whom electrification is challenging, should be emphasised and will help support a just transition. 4. Regulatory simplification and alignment The Presidency should push for streamlined permitting, regulatory simplification, continued EU-UK regulatory alignment, and harmonised digital frameworks, particularly for cross-border and third-country projects. Ireland’s status as a non-connected Member State calls for continued EU-UK regulatory alignment to prevent uncertainty and ensure fair compliance and funding. Upcoming revisions to the TEN-E Regulation and the Gas & Hydrogen Market Package will be pivotal in testing this alignment. To deliver the above key themes, the legislative files in train should continue to be prioritised through 2026. These include: EU Grids Package (Q1): Accelerates permitting, improves cross-border grid planning, and integrates hydrogen infrastructure. Cloud and AI Development Act (Q1): To strengthen Europe’s digital infrastructure. TEN-E Regulation Review (Q1): Streamlines permitting and supports cross-border energy infrastructure. - Action Plan on Affordable Energy (Q1–Q2): Targets energy price reduction and structural reforms. Energy Security Framework (Q1-Q2): Strengthens the Union’s energy security, ensuring the EU energy system is sufficiently secure and resilient. European Commission - New Initiatives ‘Energy Union package for the decade ahead’ (Q3 2026): To include legislative proposals on governance, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and CO₂ transport infrastructure. ‘Omnibus to simplify energy product legislation’ (Q2 2026): Aimed at streamlining and modernising EU rules on energy products. In conclusion, Ireland’s Presidency offers a rare opportunity for Ireland to advance a future-focused energy agenda that prioritises the transition to a low-carbon economy, strengthens security and resilience, and ensures affordability and competitiveness."
321,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/521b5051/Gas_Networks_Ireland_-_Submission_321.docx,Gas Networks Ireland,,,,2,"Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) recommends that the Presidency focus on four strategic priorities, each underpinned by legislative proposals: 1. Simplification of Rules and Funding Eligibility The Irish Presidency should prioritise simplifying EU rules, processes and digital frameworks, to cut administrative burden and boost competitiveness, critical for Ireland given its geographic isolation and reliance on UK infrastructure. Although the draft 2028–2037 Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) proposes increased energy funding, GNI has faced challenges accessing EU funds for projects outside the EU that are vital for Ireland’s security and decarbonisation. The upcoming TEN-E revision and EU Grids Package offer opportunities to broaden eligibility and streamline processes, ensuring Irish projects are not disadvantaged. Advancing Projects of Mutual Interest (PMIs) is also key to strengthening Europe’s energy system, supporting market integration and meeting climate targets. Ireland can champion the EU Grids Package, TEN-E review and Energy Security Framework to accelerate permitting, align TEN-E reforms with offshore wind and hydrogen ambitions, and drive investment in critical infrastructure. 2. Integrated Energy System A central focus for the Irish Presidency should be the advancement of an integrated, technology-neutral energy system. GNI supports legislative reforms that promote seamless planning and operability between gas, electricity and hydrogen networks, enabling Ireland to deliver least cost efficient, secure and clean energy to all customers. The EU Grids Package and TEN-E reforms will accelerate permitting and facilitate hydrogen integration, supporting Ireland’s ambitions in offshore wind and renewable gases. Additionally, the Action Plan on Affordable Energy and the Clean Industrial Deal can help align national support schemes for households and SMEs with broader EU competitiveness and affordability goals. Energy Security Energy security and network resilience, both physical and cyber, are key priorities for Ireland and should be central to the Irish Presidency’s agenda. Given that Ireland is not directly connected to another EU Member State and, that following Brexit, is heavily reliant on the UK to underpin security of supply, this underscores the need for robust investment and supportive regulatory frameworks for energy security. GNI believes that critical energy infrastructure projects that enhance Ireland and Europe’s energy security should be eligible for support under EU programmes including the Connecting Europe Facility, which currently excludes natural gas projects related to security of supply. In addition, the Presidency should advocate for the Energy Security Framework to include a technology-neutral definition of strategic storage to ensure flexibility for innovative solutions, including Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) based strategic reserves. Ireland’s Unique Position Ireland’s status as a non-connected Member State, requires special consideration in EU policy and legislation. Maintaining regulatory alignment with the UK is essential as new legislative proposals and delegated acts are developed. EU legislation must reflect Ireland’s regional specificities and avoid unfair disadvantage and misalignment. What should the Irish Presidency aim to achieve? Simplify EU rules and funding processes Advance reforms for integrated gas, electricity, and hydrogen networks • Secure EU support for critical Irish infrastructure Protect Ireland’s interests in EU legislation. Decarbonising heavy-duty vehicles remains a key EU challenge. The European Commission’s 2027 review of HDV CO₂ standards should remain a priority to ensure renewable gases play a role in reducing emissions, enhancing energy security, and delivering economic benefits across Member States."

As an island nation with a geographically distinct energy system, Ireland is uniquely positioned to champion policies that deliver tangible benefits for citizens, businesses, and communities across the EU. Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) believes that the Presidency can make the most substantial positive impact by advancing a strategic agenda focused on energy affordability, security, innovation, and regulatory simplification. The European Commission’s 2025 Action Plan for Affordable Energy remains central to its 2026 Work Programme, tackling the affordability crisis for households and businesses. Building on the original plan, the Commission will implement seven actions in close cooperation with Member States, to urgently reduce energy prices. By prioritising cost reduction, accelerating market reforms, and supporting the development of indigenous renewable energy sources, the Council can help stabilise prices and strengthen competitiveness. The Clean Industrial Deal places competitiveness and resilience at the centre of Europe’s growth agenda. Ireland’s Presidency should champion the rapid deployment and integration of renewable and low-carbon energy sources, investment in future-ready energy networks, and the protection and modernisation of critical infrastructure. By driving the implementation of the EU Grids Package, TEN-E Regulation Review, and the Gas & Hydrogen Market Package, the Council can help facilitate cross-border energy integration, support market innovation and create incentives for the production and use of renewable gases in hard-to-abate sectors such as transport and industry. Aligned with the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024–2029, Ireland’s Presidency should continue to support a just energy transition. Enabling flexible, decarbonised energy pathways for all customers, including those for whom electrification is challenging, aligns with the EU’s ambition to leave no community behind. This approach reflects GNI’s strategic priority of promoting a technology-neutral pathway to a net-zero energy system, ensuring least cost, efficient, and clean energy for all. By advocating for supportive EU policies on energy storage, grid flexibility, and decarbonisation, the Council can help deliver economic opportunities and improved quality of life for all European citizens. A core pillar of the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme is the simplification of EU legislation to reduce costs and regulatory burdens. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise the progressed delivery of omnibus packages that modernise digital and energy legislation, streamline funding eligibility, and accelerate permitting for energy projects. This will foster innovation, support the digital transformation of energy networks, and ensure that businesses can respond competitively to market opportunities. In summary, Ireland’s Presidency of the EU Council in 2026 offers a ‘once-in-a-generation’ enhanced opportunity to deliver a strategic programme securing least cost, resilient, competitive energy for all. By progressing the Action Plan for Affordable Energy, the Clean Industrial Deal, and supporting regulatory simplification, Ireland’s Presidency can make a substantial positive impact for people, businesses, and communities across the EU. GNI is positioned to support these ambitions, ensuring Ireland’s unique energy challenges and opportunities are reflected in the evolving European landscape."

By leveraging our expertise, networks, and stakeholder relationships, GNI is prepared to support the Government’s ambition to communicate the values and benefits of EU membership to all citizens. Effective stakeholder communication fosters trust, collaboration, and a shared sense of purpose. A robust stakeholder engagement plan is essential to building ownership and connection among citizens. Working closely with national bodies such as Chambers Ireland, Ibec, County Councils, Local Authorities, Academic Institutions, IIEA and other key partners will ensure the Presidency is not only understood but also experienced at local and regional levels. Elements of this approach might include: Regional outreach - Hosting Presidency-related events and meetings across Ireland’s regions, to ensure all communities feel included and heard. Collaborative forums – Organise panel discussions, workshops, and flagship events in partnership with national associations, local authorities, business groups or community organisations to discuss EU priorities and Ireland’s role. Media and communications - Launch targeted media campaigns/thought leadership articles, highlighting the real-world impact of EU membership and the Presidency’s objectives. To foster a genuine sense of ownership of the EU Council Presidency, communication must be clear, accessible, and relevant. This should involve explaining how EU membership underpins Ireland’s economic resilience, energy security and ability to tackle shared challenges such as climate change and digital transformation, as outlined in the European Commission Work Programme 2026. There is also an opportunity to showcase success stories, including EU-funded infrastructure projects, innovation in energy, and regional development that deliver tangible benefits to Irish communities. To ensure broad engagement, communications should use clear, accessible language and employ diverse, inclusive channels, such as broadcast and social media, local press, community events and project-specific digital (i.e. App development) to reach all demographics. Potential activities include: Host joint events with European gas associations and Irish stakeholders to highlight Ireland’s leadership in energy transition and security. Engage policymakers, MEPs, and EU officials to ensure Ireland’s priorities are understood and supported alongside Government efforts. Leverage GNI’s existing stakeholder networks (e.g., European gas associations, IFA, Ibec, Chambers, Wind Energy Ireland, Code Modification Forum) to amplify the Presidency through joint communications and tailored updates.

It would be important to be explicit about children as a focus group in the EU efforts through mentioning ECD as one or part of a configuration. Furthermore, it would be important to pay attention to children in war-affected regions and bring the Ireland examples on this front to the EU policy and practice. With more than 450 million children affected by wars around the world, it is empirical to focus efforts to build a peaceful world for those. Short and long term, across the generation impact of war on children is massive and should be averted preserving their childhood. The Arab region has been one most affected by wars, displacement and insecurity. Children in this region suffered most in many devastating ways. While actors on the ground tried their best to draw a smile on the face of children in the region, the global silence not only made situation harder, but also compromised the ability to respond.

In examining how we in the GAA could play a constructive role in the development of priorities and policies for Ireland’s presidency we looked at how sport plays a role across so many of the thematic policy divisions of the European Council’s work. In terms of the different categories that the Council will examine and discuss policy during the presidency there are four within which the GAA would have a significant impact in Irish life, namely: Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (EYCS) Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Environment (ENVI) Within these policy areas there are a number of items that the GAA believe they could work collaboratively with government in championing during Ireland’s term which would chime with the aims and objectives of the Council’s work, specifically around the European Sport Model. These areas of focus are: Volunteerism Indigenous Sport Economic Value of Sport Environmental Sustainability Demographics and impact of planning policy Without doubt the role of the Volunteer is a key one for us and indeed for the EU and fits perfectly with the aim of the Irish government in bringing a people centred vision to its Presidency. We hope that the following submission can be taken on board by your good offices in the consideration of the programme for the prestigious Irish presidency and that as the leading sporting and cultural organisation in Ireland that we can play a constructive role in assisting on the delivery of the themes outlined below. We thank you for the consideration of this submission and should you require further information or would like to discuss these items with us, we would be delighted to engage with you to explore this in depth."

We believe that the work of volunteers across the EU and how this shapes the lives of our citizens should be examined, highlighted and celebrated as part of the Irish Presidency. The EU places the role of volunteers in very high regard and volunteerism is regarded as a key component of the European Sport Model. The European Sport Model cites how ‘the role of volunteers is vital for organising sport across all levels. Volunteering should always be recognised and promoted. There must be structures and mechanisms in place to ensure volunteers are encouraged, socially stimulated, educated on the importance of their work, and provided with training for skills development.’ This is an opportunity for the Irish presidency to instigate a policy conversation with our partners across European nations to promote the value of volunteerism and through examples, such as the GAA, highlight the immense good that volunteers produce for our nations, consistent with the message espoused in the European Sports Model. At a time when public volunteerism is declining due to the busy nature of people’s lives, we believe that this presidency presents an ideal opportunity to renew these important values which are central to our lives and indeed the lives of all European citizens. SPECIAL VOLUNTEER POLICY SEMINAR: The GAA can play a leading role in assisting government in hosting a special seminar on the whole area of volunteerism and how the work of the volunteer can play such a central role to the well-being of European nations whilst also having a hugely significant on the economic and social value of our economies across the Union. CASE STUDY: As one of the world’s largest amateur sporting organisations we know the immense value of volunteers. However, to move beyond simple anecdotes of this value we produced a very significant report entitled ‘The Economic and Social Value of Gaelic Games on the Island of Ireland’ where the impact of volunteers was quantified by the Sport Industry Research Centre (Sheffield Hallam University). Within Ireland, data from the 2022 Irish Sports Monitor, reported that an overall regular volunteering rate of 9% as a whole, or 370,000 adults. For the GAA specifically, the report found that 4% of the adult population, 160,000 persons, play a regular voluntary role in Gaelic games. Quantifying what this means in terms of a Social Value and Social Return on Investment (SROI) was researched by Sheffield Hallam University and they put a value of activity at €2.87bn from the outcomes achieved by active participation and volunteering. The replacement cost of volunteering within the GAA alone was valued at €1.056bn. These are hugely significant figures and can be used in leading an informed debate across European delegations on the value each of our nations place on volunteerism."

In the EU’s own European Sport Model document, it is stated that ‘revenue from professional sport should support youth development, amateur level activities, and infrastructure. This means having a solidary mechanism between all levels of sport, from grassroots and volunteering up to elite sport. Its focus should be on communities and support participation and progression.’ In Ireland’s case the largest sporting organisation in the country is in fact an amateur one in the form of the GAA. Notwithstanding our amateur status we produce significant revenues and economic gain to the Irish economy. Our most recent study showed the GAA has on the economy of Ireland with total economic activity attributable to Gaelic games of €1.62bn. This figure equates to 10.2% of the sport industry. The Irish presidency offers a unique chance and backdrop to highlight the debate around the sustainable funding of sport, which is so topical right now in the European Parliament. On October 7th there was a resolution passed in the European Parliament, led by Polish MEP and former Minister for Culture Bogdan Zdrojewski, (adopted by 552 votes to 52, with 35 abstentions) on the role of EU policies in shaping the European Sport Model. Parliament stressed the fundamental importance of the principle of solidarity and reaffirmed the need to strengthen the link between professional and grassroots sport through more effective financial solidarity mechanisms. UEFA commented after the vote that it is “a clear commitment to protect and strengthen the principles that define football in Europe: solidarity, open competitions, sporting merit, sustainability, inclusiveness, integrity and territoriality.” That desire of Europe’s parliamentarians to see more effective financial solidarity mechanisms is one which can be championed during the Irish presidency and explore how different sporting organisations, global and domestic, use funds raised for the development of sport or otherwise. In the GAA 82 cent of every euro raised through our activities is reinvested back into the development of our games and our facilities. Serving EU values and solidarity We note that in the resolution the Parliament invited the Commission to: - encourage sports governing bodies to implement youth development mechanisms and policies; - identify and improve existing financial solidarity mechanisms; - strengthen legal certainty for sports governing bodies; - develop accessible and substantial financing systems for the benefit of sports clubs and organisations; - promote consistent standards of financial governance across all professional sports. The resolution highlighted the need to significantly increase funding for sport and physical activity, particularly within the framework of the Erasmus+ programme for the period 2028-2034. Given the fact that such a debate was just held in the European Parliament, we feel it would prove extremely beneficial that Ireland helps bring that debate even further in exploring the financial solidarity principle during the course of the Irish Presidency."

The values, espoused by so many sports mirror the values and beliefs of the EU and the shared experiences at sporting events bring us closer together in a way that no other events can. Those moments offer the chance for the Presidency to connect with vast audiences and reaffirm the positivity which comes from membership of the Union. With so many major sporting events taking place during the second half of next year across the EU and here in Ireland there is potential to connect with fans who benefit from the freedom to move freely through the EU and attend sporting events. This can happen through a coordinated plan for the creation of EU sponsored fan zones at events and by on the ground campaigns at relevant major events also."

Three of those in particular are in the areas of Indigenous Sport, the Environment and Demographics. Indigenous Sport: At a time when globalisation and marketing threaten to reduce the values of what marks our nations out as special and unique the role of indigenous sports is something that can highlight the distinct identity of nations within our European family. Undoubtedly the game of soccer is a leading sport in nations across the continent of Europe. However, there are still many nations that have traditional native games, which are extremely important to the identity, culture and the history of their people. We here in Ireland, and the GAA in particular, are very proud of how the ancient game of hurling holds a unique space in our lives. Hurling now holds UNESCO status and the importance of making sure we invest in games and pastimes unique to the member nations of the Union is something that I believe the Irish presidency can champion through debate with member states. Environment: We note that the EU Strategic Agenda (2024-2029) has a firm commitment to ‘the green and digital transitions, including a genuine energy union and investment in game-changing digital technologies in Europe.’ The GAA is committed to the promotion of a green agenda with very specific training programmes that are having meaningful impacts all over the country. We have partnered with the Department of Climate, Energy and Environment over the last four years to roll out a Green Clubs programme, which empowers clubs to act at grassroots level in the areas of biodiversity, water, energy and travel. Such has been the success of this initiative that it is now being used as the template for the ‘Sustainable Sports Programme’, which is being rolled out across sporting codes by the Department of Climate. The Sports Sustainability Programme was featured recently at the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport's ‘Playing for the Planet’ Conference. Highlighting the work of the government, during the Irish presidency, with the sporting NGB’s on the Green Club initiative is a tangible way we would demonstrate the ground up approach to climate activism and engagement with the general population. Demographics: This issue of demographics and the ever-changing landscapes of our urban and rural settlements is undoubtedly a huge challenge for Europe as governments seek to address housing requirements for its citizens. Many countries have seen rural depopulation and an increasing urbanisation due to planning policies driving people towards cities for economic reasons. This not only has an impact on the resources of these places but has a knock-on impact on the areas where depopulation occurs and the social fabric of life there. The GAA Demographics Committee recommends that Ireland’s 2026 Presidency focus on several interlinked policy areas, where the Council can play a meaningful role in addressing the challenges of demographic change."

From Europe to the Americas, Asia, and beyond, we face the same challenge: creative professionals face increasing pressure from technological and market shifts that undermine their ability to earn a living. Musicians are early adopters of technology, but that same technology is being used by others to steal creative work without consent or remuneration. This is not just a sectoral issue; it is a systemic problem affecting cultural diversity and the resilience of creative economies worldwide. The EU has recognized these concerns through its program on improving working conditions for cultural and creative professionals. This initiative is vital because it acknowledges that fair remuneration and rights protection are prerequisites for a thriving and unique creative sector. Linking this priority to the broader European agenda on social fairness and digital transformation is essential to ensure that artists are not left behind. Working Together with AEPO-ARTIS: AEPO-ARTIS has been a leading voice for performers’ rights in Europe, and IMARA is a partner that strongly supports its efforts. We have the same vision which is a fair and transparent system where performers receive equitable remuneration for the use of their work, whether on streaming platforms, in audiovisual productions, or in emerging AI-driven contexts. Collaboration between our organizations is key to addressing these challenges effectively and ensuring that the upcoming Irish Presidency of the EU Council places this issue firmly on its agenda. The Issue: Despite the cultural and economic value that performers bring, musicians do not earn the recognition they deserve and many struggle to secure even basic income from their work. Streaming models concentrate revenues among a few, leaving most artists with negligible returns. Music performers often receive one-time fees, with no share in ongoing revenues. Generative AI uses creative works without consent or compensation, eroding trust and value. These realities create precarious working conditions that contradict the EU’s commitment to fairness and sustainability. Ireland’s Presidency offers a unique opportunity to champion better working conditions for creative professionals. By prioritizing fair remuneration in streaming, AI and audiovisual, the EU can set a global standard for cultural policy in the digital era. The current crisis is also an opportunity to promote a unique, vibrant, and fair cultural sector. IMARA wants to be a part of this story, and we stand ready to work alongside AEPO-ARTIS and all stakeholders to make this vision a reality."

We would also encourage inclusion of this priority in the work program 2027. This directly involves investing in skills, education and health systems thereby strengthening the social model and quality of life across the EU. It is also consistent with the vision set out by the European Commission President, Dr Ursula von der Leyen who in her Political Guidelines for the 2024 -2029 Commission has commented on the need to “step up our work on preventative health, in particular for mental health”. She has also commented that one of the greatest challenges in this decade is “protecting the mental health of our children and young people – especially online”. Commitment to such a high-level priority would improve EU citizens social and economic well being, strengthen health co-operation and resilience and protect people – especially children particularly in online environments. This would represent a tangible commitment by the Irish Presidency to strengthen the European Child Guarantee and increase attention to children’s well-being, mental health and family environments. The Irish Presidency could encourage the Council to frame parenting support as a key service for reducing child anxiety and improve resilience. This could also involve encouraging Member States to integrate evidence based parenting programmes into their updated Child Guarantee Actions Plans, which are due in 2026/2027."

There is also the opportunity to review the implementation of the EU Anti Poverty Strategy, which will cover child poverty and the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. Child Poverty and parenting stress/anxiety are very strongly linked with parenting programmes offering the real potential to reduce the negative impacts of poverty on children’s mental health. Parental stress, mental health challenges and a lack of parenting support are all aspects which link poverty and child outcomes. Family support and parenting support programmes are protective and cost effective interventions which should flow from the Anti Poverty Strategy. There are also other EU Strategies to be considered over the period of the Irish Presidency which are directly relevant to providing support to parents, children, youth and families, including The Intergenerational Fairness Strategy – with parenting support being a preventative investment with long term payoffs in adult mental health, educational outcomes and reduced service costs. This allows Ireland to position parenting programmes as a strategic, not merely a social investment. Action Plan against Cyber Bullying – a key initiative addressing anxiety and mental health with the potential to frame cyberbullying as a family level issue which requires parental support and digital parenting skills, ideally within a European framework for digital parenting support. Cyber bullying is directly linked with adolescent anxiety, self harm and emotional regulation which can be supported by family focused and led mental health prevention. Education Package and Digital Education Roadmap – with the opportunity for the Irish Presidency to promote the concept of whole school, whole family well being ecosystems given that schools are major settings for parental support and mental health promotions, through parent school partnerships.

Disruptions to services like telecommunications, water, energy, transportation, or finance can have a severe impact on citizens and the economy, often extending beyond the affected sector. A system-based, allhazards approach to infrastructure resilience is crucial for maintaining service continuity in the face of various threats. Climate risks and other natural hazards, digital threats, and security risks are threats that can all disrupt the water services. We would like to see critical infrastructure resilience and security included as a high-level thematic priority during Irelands Presidency. It must be recognised that water services infrastructure is one of the core components of member states infrastructure, and is essential in supporting business, facilitating trade, meeting the countries housing challenges, ensuring public health and protecting our environment.

Environmental Omnibus legislation: Uisce Eireann recognises the importance of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Habitats Directive in protecting water bodies, habitats and species. We would highlight also the importance of the WFD in the protection of quality of drinking water sources, and no changes should be made to the directive that would allow a degradation of drinking water source quality. In the context of the final 2027 deadline of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) coming up very soon and the RESourceEU Action Plan adopted by the Commission on the 3rd of December 2025 to review and revise the WFD in Q2 2026, we would advocate for a focus on European environmental legislation impacting on the water cycle and water services, particularly the WFD itself and also the Habitats Directive (HD).

We would advocate for a close examination of the WFD and HD, to see what changes could be made in order to enable Uisce Eireann, and also other sectors impacting on the water cycle and WFD environmental objectives, to be more efficient and effective in delivering environmental improvements to our water bodies. We would advocate for the presidency's support for the implementation of the recast Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. We advocate supporting the European Commission’s environmental simplification package relating to infrastructure delivery and its proposal for a regulation on speeding-up Environmental Assessments as it will support the acceleration of the timelines of critical infrastructure projects. We advocate supporting the implementation of the Circular Economy Act (CEA). The CEA aims to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy, increasing the EU’s economic security, resilience, competitiveness, and decarbonisation. Due for adoption in 2026, the president of the Council of the European Union in 2026 will be in a good position to support its implementation across Europe. We would also highlight the importance of Cybersecurity and energy security to support water critical infrastructure which should be supported during the Presidency."

Violence against women is prevalent in the EU and Cyber VAW comprises the many forms this violence takes in the digital world. These include cyber harassment, cyber stalking, non-consensual sharing of intimate material (including deep fakes) and hate speech/misogynistic content, among others. CVAW is part of the continuum of violence that women and girls experience for reasons related to their gender offline, and it is equally harmful. In fact, the harm of cyber violence is multiplied because by its nature it is easily amplifiable, persistent, and in many cases, permanent. These forms of abuse frequently overlap with offline forms of abuse, especially in domestic abuse cases and sexual violence. EIGE estimates that one in ten women have experienced a form of cyber violence since the age of 15. While cyber violence can affect anybody, women and girls are disproportionally affected, in particular young women, women subjected to intersecting forms of discrimination and women in the public sphere (journalists, politicians, activists). CVAW seems to be increasing, with new technologies providing new tools of abuse, in particular the EWL report warns against artificial intelligence, virtual reality and online gaming as increasingly threatening forms of CVAW. The huge harmful impact of the manosphere and of pornography, -including the normalisation of strangulation and of violent pornography which would be illegal offline but can be legally hosted online - are also of great concern. The European Union has taken measures against CVAW, in particular specific Articles of the Directive 2024/1385 on combating violence against women and domestic violence (Articles 5 to 8) and the Digital Services Act. However, gaps remain in terms of legislation, enforcement, harmonisation and data collection. Notably, the Artificial Intelligence Act does not contain any express reference to CVAW. Notwithstanding the above efforts, cyber violence against women and girls continues, and the response of social media and online platforms is clearly not good enough. We note that the Commission programme for 2026 includes a commitment to “ensure that the online environment is safe, fair and empowering so that people can make the most of technology” and we recommend a strong gender analysis is used in its implementation to counteract the prevalence and harmful impact of cyber violence on women and girls. Our recommendation also builds on the current Danish presidency work-plan goals to make online service providers more accountable for content on their platforms, combat sexual exploitation of children online, combating violence against women including exposure of men and boys to unrealistic ideals of masculinity and misogynistic content online and protecting children and young people online. Given the presence of many digital multinational platforms in Ireland, the Irish EU presidency presents a great opportunity to lead on the response to cyber violence against women and girls."

This would include prevention and awareness raising measures, improved legislation and enforcement, stronger duties on platforms to limit and rapidly respond to CVAW, support for victims and research and data collection. There is a need to: Improve the VAW Directive, extend it to forms of CVAW currently not covered and monitor its transposition. Address online misogyny, which is the most common form of online hate. Strengthen the regulation of AI in relation to how it is used to commit and amplify CVAW. Address the harms of new forms of online CVAW, such as violence in the metaverse and online gaming. Enhance the mechanisms for fast removal of CVAW from platforms and social media. Improve enforcement of DSA and monitor its efficiency in combating CVAW. Improve research and harmonise data collection and collaboration. Improve protection of minors. The harms of pornography (to children and adults) should also be addressed, with measures like criminalisation of violent pornography that depicts rape, incest, or strangulation/suffocation (as in recent UK legislation) - ensuring parity between online and offline regulation of abusive behaviours, whereby; what is illegal offline cannot be legally created or disseminated online. Artificial Intelligence and other use of ‘deepfake’ production also needs to be addressed whereby innocent parties' images and voices are being grossly misused to create fake videos, images and speech that can cause serious harm and distress. Individuals are entitled to protection of their image and voice from such increasingly prevalent online abuses. Women’s Aid is agnostic as to which piece of legislation or policy initiative should be used in this respect, but the following items in the Commission workplan could be useful opportunities: Action plan against cyberbullying. Gender Equality Strategy 2026-2030. Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child sexual abuse material and replacing Council Framework Decision 2004/68/JHA (recast). Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL laying down rules to prevent and combat child sexual abuse. Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA. A more inclusive and protective Europe: extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime (to extend hate crimes to those based on gender). Women’s Aid endorses the recommendations to the EU in the EWL report and in the Strasbourg call to combat cyber violence against women and girls and look forward to the Irish presidency providing a strong lead in this vital matter.

The review process needs to be completed before the summer of 2026 and significant changes are needed in order for Europe to remain competitive. Going forward in the merger review more attention should be on dynamic effects (ability and incentives to innovate) vs. static effects (price and output). In certain cases it should be recognised that for EU companies scale is needed in order to innovate and to be able to compete at a global lvel scale. Regulators must recognise that scale is a necessary condition to compete effectively on global markets 7.

Likewise, European companies would benefit from more user friendly and clear approach to the e-privacy rules. Streamlining implementation of the AI Act across Europe – in addition to the proposed simplification of the EU AI Act (and corresponding proposed changes to the EU Acquis), additional work should be done to make sure that the network of governmental agencies and bodies across the EU that will be entrusted with the competencies to enforce the EU AI Act have the obligation to collaborate and a suitable framework, both at national and EU level, also including other authorities and bodies with overlapping competencies (Data Protection Authorities, Cybersecurity Authorities (NIS2), Sectoral Regulators, Competition Authorities etc). Pursue initiatives aimed at strengthening EU digital sovereignty – building on the momentum of the Apply AI strategy and additional national initiatives, the Irish Presidency should focus on further operationalisation of these initiatives. 28th Regime – accelerate the preparatory phase of introducing the EU 28th regime; Review of EU merger control – finalise the review of the EU Merger Guidelines asap; Further simplification – support initiatives to identify further opportunities for further simplification of the EU regulations.

To do this, initiatives that build stronger connections between young people and their European identities should be championed from an early age within the Irish education system. Ireland should prioritise the early and sustained introduction of European citizenship education across the Irish school system, recognising that meaningful engagement with European values and identity from the earliest years is essential to a resilient democratic future. The European Education Area (EEA) sets out a vision of creating a unified and inclusive space in which all EU citizens can access high-quality education and lifelong learning opportunities across borders. Its strategic priorities include raising the quality, equity, and inclusiveness of education and training systems; promoting lifelong learning and cross-border mobility; strengthening the skills, status, and motivation of the education workforce; and further developing and integrating the EU’s higher education sector. Where the Erasmus+ programme has provided support to the development of the EEA, there is scope to develop opportunities for experiential learning for all learners with targeted promotion of the resources available on the European Schools Education Platform and the potential connections forged across Europe through collaborative projects using eTwinning. eTwinning is an online platform funded by the European Union that enables schools, teachers and students across Europe to collaborate on shared educational projects. eTwinning is part of the EU’s Erasmus+ programme. It provides a safe, secure online space where teachers and students from different European countries can meet, work together and share ideas. It supports international school partnerships, digital learning, and cultural exchange. A key priority of the Presidency should therefore be the promotion of the eTwinning programme and the European Schools Education Platform in Ireland through the Department of Education and Youth. eTwinning and the European Schools Education Platform should be valued as essential resources for engaging learners in active citizenship from an early age to achieve the aims of the EEA."

Chief amongst these is demographic change. Demographic trends globally point to an ageing, more urbanized, world. This is reflected in the direction of demographic change across the European Union. Eurostat estimated the population of the European Union, at 1 January, 2024, to be 449.3 million. Those aged 65 and over made up 21.6% of the population. This represents an increase of 2.9% over the previous 10 years. The median age of the EU’s population was 44.7 years on 1 January 2024, an increase of 2.2 years from a decade earlier. The old-age dependency ratio increased by 5.6 percentage points during the past decade, rising from 28.3% in 2014 to 33.9% in 2024. Eurostat’s populations projections for the period 2023 to 2100 show that the EU’s population is projected to continue to age. The share of those aged 80 years or above in the EU's population is projected to have a 2.5 fold increase between 2024 and 2100, from 6.1% to 15.3%. The European Commission Green Paper on Ageing – Fostering Solidarity and Responsibility Between Generations (COM 2021) notes: “In the last five decades, life expectancy at birth has increased by about 10 years for both men and women…. Europe is by no means the only continent with an ageing population, but the process is most advanced here. This trend is having a significant impact on people’s everyday lives and on our societies. It has implications for economic growth, fiscal sustainability, health and long-term care, well-being and social cohesion. But ageing also provides new opportunities for creating new jobs, fostering social fairness and boosting prosperity, for instance in the ‘silver’ and care economies.” With the correct interventions and a focus on developing Age Friendly communities, Europe can create a society that supports older people’s participation, contribution, independence, health and wellbeing, long into later life. Recent years have seen the development of a suite of EU policy documents recognizing the demographic changes Europe is experiencing. The European Commission’s Green Paper concludes that healthy and active ageing had a positive impact on the labour market and thus also on social security systems. The paper acknowledges the need for concrete and decisive action to support older people in all policy areas. The EU Care Strategy (September 2022) aims at improving childcare and long-term care for older people and people with disabilities. In October 2023, the EU Commission presented what it called a “demography toolbox” - a list of policies that EU member states can implement to manage the consequences of demographic change. The WHO Europe is preparing the WHO European Strategy on Ageing is Living: Promoting a Lifetime of Health and Well-being (2026–2030). We propose, as an International Leader, that Ireland should choose the Age Friendly agenda on Ageing as a high-level thematic priority for its Presidency of the Council in 2026. Ireland has a considerable amount of progress to showcase and contribute to European policy on ageing and older people, in terms of expertise in public policy areas such as Age Friendly Workplaces, Age Friendly Housing, Age Friendly Transport Infrastructure, Age Friendly Health and Wellbeing and many others."

In December 2022, the Spanish Presidency asked the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) to draft an exploratory opinion on a possible future European strategy for older people. The key points of the EESC opinion are: a paradigm shift towards older people, moving away from a care-based approach to focus on empowering them, and eradicating ageist views; that the EU adopt a new European Strategy for Older Persons … with the objectives of protecting all their rights and ensuring their full participation in society and the economy; that the European Commission and the Member States urgently draft, develop, sign, implement and monitor a European Declaration on Older People to reflect the commitment to developing a European Strategy for Older Persons; that the European Commission organises a European Year of Older People, sets up a European Agency for Older People, Ageing and the Demographic Challenge and calls for the adoption of a UN Convention on the Rights of Older Persons. The Presidency subsequently convened a conference in Madrid (29 November 2023) to explore more broadly the development of a possible European strategy for older people. It advocated that a strategy “supported by national plans, will be the platform upon which to build dedicated initiatives and regulatory measures to reaping the benefits of demographic change.” In order to advance the recommendations of this conference, the opportunity exists for the EU and Members States to rethink and improve EU policies for older people and to seize the opportunities offered by demographic change. Age Friendly Ireland recommends that the Irish Presidency host a meeting of the Council of Ministers with a view to progressing an Age Friendly European strategy for older people, which we are in a position to co-design and host. A new European Commission strategy on ageing communities should align with the WHO framework and its eight domains for Age Friendly Communities. As a global leader working in this space Ireland has made significant progress in policy development, relative to ageing and older people, and evidenced through policy implementation, producing demonstrable benefits for older people in Ireland, through the vehicle of the Age Friendly Ireland Shared Service office."

Ireland is the first formally recognised fully affiliated Age Friendly Country in the world, as recognised by the WHO.",3,"Addressing the challenges and embracing the opportunities of an ageing continent The demographic trend, at national, EU and global levels, will pose both economic and societal challenges. “[T]the number of people aged 75-84 will grow by 56.1% and the number of people aged 65-74 by 16.6%, while the number of people aged less than 55 will decrease by 13.5%. While this pressure is felt across the economy, it shows most strongly in the healthcare and old-age nursing sector… Under a paradigm of balanced public budgets and without strong countermeasures, this trend will require a relatively larger portion of Europe’s productive capacity to be diverted towards caring for older persons, leaving the rest of the economy with relatively less capital and human resources. This, in turn, would put an additional question mark to the global competitiveness of the European economy, which is already severely challenged due to skills shortages and high energy prices.” Societal challenges include a lack of access to services, loneliness and ageism and an increasingly digitalized society that risks leaving people behind. A European Strategy for Older Persons could address these challenges, while simultaneously promoting the opportunities an ageing demographic affords. It would support the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (as they relate to older people), and the World Health Organisation’s Decade of Healthy Ageing goals. As referenced above, Ireland is recognised as a world leader in advancing the Age Friendly agenda. Programme for Government 2025 – Securing Ireland’s Future commits to the hosting of an International WHO Age Friendly Conference (which Age Friendly Ireland have proposed to host in County Meath). The hosting of a meeting of the Council of Ministers (conference) as part of the Irish Presidency with a view to progressing an Age Friendly European strategy for older people would be an excellent precursor to the proposed International Conference as set out in Programme for Government. This conference could explore how an EU strategy could drive the transition to a Europe that is inclusive, fair and sustainable, and that values and respects our older populations (nationally, regionally and globally). The opportunity exists to advance a European Declaration on Older People, based on the Dublin Declaration on Age Friendly Cities and Communities, as we move towards the end of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing in 2030. In November 2025 AFI presented to a special conference, hosted by Nina Carberry MEP, in the European Parliament, and showcased how the Irish programme has supported older people to live more independently, stay socially connected and continue contributing to community life, sharing examples of successful local initiatives, which could be replicated across the EU. MEP Carberry commented that the European Parliament “must be more aware of ageing communities when making public policy.” A European Strategy for Older People could address the current gaps in EU policy for older people."

Comhlámh recommends the following high-level thematic priorities: 1. A Human-Rights-Centred EU Response to Conflict, Genocide, Displacement, and Migration The EU urgently needs coordinated, principled, and rights-based approaches to conflict, genocide, forced displacement, and migration. Ireland should champion an EU response that centres international humanitarian and human rights law; prioritises civilian protection; and upholds the rights and dignity of displaced people, asylum seekers, and migrants. This includes challenging the increasing externalisation of EU border policy and promoting safe, legal, and humane pathways to protection. 2. Protecting and Strengthening the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) At a time when fundamental rights are under increasing pressure, Ireland should place the protection of the ECHR at the heart of its Presidency. Safeguarding the ECHR architecture and resisting attempts to dilute existing protections is essential to maintaining the EU’s credibility as a rights-based project. 3. Advancing Peace, Justice, and Non-Militarised Approaches to Security Ireland’s long-standing commitment to peacebuilding, diplomacy, and neutrality positions it to play a leadership role in countering the escalating militarisation of the EU. The Presidency should prioritise conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and mediation, and ensure that EU security policy does not contribute to cycles of violence or undermine human rights. Collectively, these priorities would support a Presidency that strengthens the EU’s legitimacy, responds to global crises with justice and integrity, and aligns with Ireland’s own historical commitments to peace-building and solidarity."

EU Trade, Sanctions, and Accountability Mechanisms Regarding Israel Ireland should work to advance EU-level measures that reflect international law, including: A ban on trade with illegal Israeli settlements, in line with the Occupied Territories Bill and international legal obligations. EU sanctions in response to grave and ongoing violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. These measures are essential to upholding EU commitments to justice, human dignity, and international law. 2. Protection of People Seeking Asylum in Europe Ireland should prioritise legislation and Council discussions that strengthen asylum protections and uphold the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Key actions include: Ensuring that EU asylum and migration policy aligns with the Refugee Convention and international human rights law. Ending the use of deterrence-based approaches and externalisation agreements that undermine the right to seek asylum. Embedding human dignity, safety, and due process at the centre of EU asylum systems. 3. Enforcement Mechanisms to Prevent Illegal Pushbacks at EU Borders Ireland should champion robust accountability mechanisms for Member States involved in illegal pushbacks on land and sea. This includes: Independent monitoring of border practices. Effective sanctions and infringement proceedings for violations. Ensuring that all Frontex operations uphold human rights and do not contribute to pushbacks or abuse at EU borders. 4. Ensuring Trade Policy Prioritises Fairness and Ecological Sustainability Ireland should use its Presidency to ensure that EU trade agreements prioritise human rights, environmental protection, and fair economic structures over extractive or destructive models of global trade."

First, Ireland should ensure that pro-Palestinian voices, as well as all voices advocating for human rights, peace, and accountability, can participate fully in EU-level debates without fear of exclusion, censorship, or discrimination. A democratic Union depends on open civic space and the ability of affected communities to speak for themselves. Second, Ireland’s long history of peacebuilding and military neutrality offers an important counterbalance to the growing militarisation of EU policy. By foregrounding diplomacy, conflict prevention, peacebuilding, and rights-based security approaches, Ireland can help ensure that EU policies reduce harm rather than deepen cycles of violence. Third, any attempt to articulate “positive impact” must acknowledge the interdependence of people and planet. Without embedding ecological sustainability at the core of all EU policy areas (trade, migration, security, and economic policy among them) the Union cannot claim to be acting in the interests of its citizens. Ireland should recognise that any meaningful positive impact for people, communities, and societies across the EU depends on prioritising ecological sustainability and a just transition. By this we mean a shift away from extractive, militarised and fossil-fuel-dependent systems towards models of living and working that are fair, inclusive, rights-based, and centred on global solidarity. By taking these steps, Ireland can help steer the EU toward a more just, sustainable, and peaceful future."
218,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/e8bb124f/Comhl%C3%A1mh_-_Submission_218.docx,Comhlámh,,,,4,"Effective communication of the values and benefits of EU membership must begin with an honest acknowledgement of the widening disconnect between the EU’s stated commitments to human rights and the reality of many current EU policies, particularly in areas such as migration, militarisation, and external action. Without naming this gap, any public engagement risks appearing superficial and exclusionary. Honesty is essential if Ireland’s Presidency is to communicate meaningfully with citizens and rebuild trust. Ireland should therefore promote a communication approach rooted in transparency, participation, and genuine dialogue. This means recognising that many people feel excluded from EU decision-making and that building a community genuinely rooted in shared values is slow, often uncomfortable work that cannot be reduced to simplified narratives or celebratory messaging. To do this, Ireland’s Presidency should: Create accessible, meaningful spaces where people, especially those most affected by inequality, racism, displacement, and marginalisation, can articulate their own visions for Europe. Facilitate civil-society-led initiatives, global citizenship education, and deliberative public forums that support people to engage critically and constructively with EU policies. Listen and respond, ensuring that insights from those rarely represented in EU policy debates are not merely collected but meaningfully shape the Presidency’s narrative and priorities. Rather than relying on narrow definitions of “EU benefits,” Ireland should invite deeper conversations about the values that should guide European cooperation. A Presidency rooted in humility, participation, justice, and accountability would not only strengthen democratic engagement but also model the kind of Europe many people want to see inclusive, rights-based, transparent, and committed to the wellbeing of all."

Our work has always been shaped by relationships. It has grown through the experiences of returned volunteers, the commitments of our member groups, and the insights of partners in the Global South. At its core is the shared belief that justice is something we build with one another, not for one another. Values-led international volunteering, critical global citizenship education, and long-term activism shown us that people are ready to engage deeply when they are trusted, supported, and invited into meaningful conversation. This spirit runs through all of our responses in this consultation. Whether addressing migration, militarisation, trade, have human rights, or environmental sustainability, our perspective is shaped by what we have witnessed over decades: people want to act ethically, communities want to be heard, and policy is strong when it is informed by lived experience. Ireland’s 2026 EU Presidency provides an opportunity to bring these principles into the heart of European cooperation. A Presidency grounded in justice, participation, and transparency can bridge the gap between the EU’s stated values and current policies. It can promote rights-based approaches to migration, challenge the drift toward militarisation, strengthen human rights protections, and ensure ecological sustainability is embedded as a core principle rather than treated as an optional theme. Comhlámh will continue to champion solidarity that is reflective, grounded, and collective. We submit these responses in the hope that Ireland’s Presidency can help nurture a Europe that people across communities are calling for: inclusive, accountable, rights-based, and committed to the wellbeing of both people and planet."

Global markets are evolving rapidly, and the EU must ensure its Single Market remains a driver of growth, innovation, and resilience. Vodafone Ireland believes that competitiveness should be a core theme for the Presidency, and we strongly recommend that connectivity is embedded as a key pillar within that theme. Digital connectivity infrastructure is the foundation upon which Europe’s economic ambitions rest. Without modern, efficient networks, Europe cannot deliver on its goals for artificial intelligence, green transition, or industrial leadership. Connectivity enables every sector—from healthcare and education to manufacturing and public services—to innovate and thrive. The Presidency should therefore champion policies that create the conditions for investment in next-generation networks and reduce fragmentation in the telecommunications market. This is not about digital connectivity being a theme of the Irish Presidency; it is about recognising that competitiveness depends on connectivity. A strong Digital Networks Act will be central to this effort. By advancing this legislation, Ireland can help transform Europe’s telecoms landscape into a coherent single market, unlocking investment, reducing duplication, and creating sustainable growth. Embedding connectivity within the competitiveness agenda will deliver tangible benefits for citizens and businesses, from rural broadband access to advanced digital services. It will also reinforce Ireland’s reputation as a leader in shaping practical, forward-looking EU policy. In short, competitiveness without connectivity is incomplete—and Ireland’s Presidency can make that connection clear."

The Digital Networks Act (DNA), expected to be published in January 2026, is not simply another update to telecoms rules—it is a once-in-a-generation chance to modernise a framework that, for over 20 years, has been geared toward voice calls and basic connectivity, not the AI-powered supply chains, smart applications, and high-capacity networks that now define Europe’s digital ambitions. Ireland is well placed to drive this agenda, but it will not be without challenges. There will be differing views on the best path forward for key elements of the Digital Networks Act and as with any major reform, there may be calls to moderate ambition or delay decisions. However, it is important to recognise that postponing meaningful change risks perpetuating fragmentation and underinvestment, ultimately leaving Europe less competitive on the global stage. The cost of inaction is clear—fragmentation, underinvestment, and a regulatory environment that stifles innovation and leaves Europe lagging behind global competitors. Delayed or heavily diluted implementation would not only limit opportunities for businesses to innovate and grow, but also slow the delivery of high-quality, affordable digital services to consumers—impacting everyday connectivity, access to new technologies, and the overall digital experience for people across Europe. The Irish Presidency should aim to build consensus, but also to maintain ambition. Ireland should champion a forward-looking approach that prioritises investment, scale, and the deployment of highquality networks—both in the medium and long term. This means advocating for a predictable, investment-friendly spectrum framework, with longer licence durations and coordinated release roadmaps that give operators the certainty needed to invest in next-generation infrastructure. Reform here is essential to unlocking the full potential of 5G Standalone, satellite connectivity, and future technologies. The Presidency should also encourage the DNA to address regulatory complexity and outdated obligations, streamlining rules to support innovation and competition. Europe’s digital future depends on a framework that enables operators to deliver advanced services, supports fair competition, and ensures that connectivity is a driver of growth, inclusion, and resilience. By leading on the Digital Networks Act, Ireland can demonstrate its commitment to a future-ready Europe—one where digital infrastructure empowers every sector, drives regional development, and supports the ambitions of citizens and businesses alike. The Presidency must seize this moment to push the legislation forward, resist efforts to dilute its impact, and ensure that Europe’s telecoms sector is equipped for the challenges and opportunities of the next decade. In doing so, Ireland will not only secure its own digital future, but also help shape a more competitive, innovative, and connected Europe."

The Digital Networks Act can serve as a catalyst for progress—helping to modernise Europe’s connectivity framework and create the conditions for investment in high-quality digital infrastructure. This is not about support for the telecommunications sector alone – this is about fostering innovation and growth, enabling businesses to expand and communities to benefit from new technologies and services by supporting the development of a more predictable, investment-friendly environment. The benefits of these reforms will extend beyond throughout all sections of society. Improved connectivity can enhance access to education, healthcare, and public services, making it easier for people to participate in the digital society and benefit from new innovations. While the needs of EU citizens are diverse and evolving, a modernised regulatory framework will help ensure that Europe is better equipped to respond to future challenges and opportunities—whether that means supporting remote work, enabling smart cities, or fostering digital inclusion. The Irish Presidency’s leadership in driving forward the Digital Networks Act and related reforms can help create a more enabling environment for progress, while respecting the unique circumstances and priorities of different Member States. By focusing on policies that support investment, innovation, and high-quality networks, the Council can help deliver tangible improvements for people, businesses, and communities across Europe—now and into the future."

Ireland should therefore focus its Presidency agenda on initiatives that advance energy affordability, strengthen energy efficiency, and diversify clean and secure energy options. In this context, the upcoming review of the recast Energy Efficiency Directive will be critical; Ireland should advocate for an approach that couples efficiency measures with carbon emission reductions, ensuring that policies deliver both cost savings and meaningful progress toward climate goals. A key priority should be ensuring that the forthcoming 2040 climate framework is supported by robust, deliverable policies and the necessary supports to maintain competitiveness, particularly for sectors and regions most exposed to transition costs. The Presidency should champion a technology-neutral approach, recognising that no single solution will meet Europe’s 2050 goals. The 2024 BusinessEurope energy study underscores this point, noting that while deep electrification will play a major role, the future system will rely on a broad mix of energy carriers, including biomethane and biomass products. In shaping negotiations on upcoming energy-efficiency measures, decarbonisation tools, and rural energy policies, Ireland should prioritise balanced energy choices that allow all regions, especially rural communities and businesses, to participate meaningfully and affordably in the transition. Liquid Gas Ireland emphasises that these communities face distinct challenges and must be explicitly included in policy design. Through its leadership in 2026, Ireland should aim to deliver a Presidency that: strengthens Europe’s competitiveness by reducing energy costs; embeds technology neutrality across climate and energy files; supports flexible, practical decarbonisation pathways; and safeguards the competitiveness and viability of rural homes, businesses, and industry.

Drawing on Food Vision 2030, Origin Green, Bord Bia and domestic research expertise, Ireland can show how complementary cropping, entrepreneurship, manufacturing and farmer viability can reinforce one another. This approach lowers healthcare burdens, supports rural communities, enhances autonomy, and delivers visible benefits to citizens. Structured policy work across CAP, CMO, procurement and R&I, paired with targeted Presidency showcases in Ireland, will translate this insight into practical EU-level outcomes. 1. High-level priority Ireland’s Presidency in 2026 comes at a moment when the EU must pivot from policy ambition to delivery on food security, public health, strategic autonomy and competitiveness. A credible and unifying priority is: Efficient food production for direct human nutrition, safeguarding resources for future generations. Ireland is uniquely placed to lead this, given its: Trusted agri-food expertise, Food Vision 2030 framework, internationally recognised sustainability model (Origin Green), export excellence (Bord Bia), and ability to bridge rural and innovation interests. We propose organising the Presidency’s agenda around three mutually reinforcing pillars: (1) Efficient and resilient food systems Europe should prioritise using agricultural resources in the most efficient way possible to feed people directly with healthy foods. This reduces pressure on land and water, strengthens autonomy, enhances preparedness, and supports future generations. Increased use of crops for direct food consumption complements existing livestock sectors and contributes to system-wide resilience. Sustainable Competitiveness & Rural Opportunity Resilient food systems are essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy and economic security. They create highquality jobs, foster entrepreneurship, and unlock export potential while providing stable markets for farmers through diversified cropping, processing, logistics, and manufacturing. Ireland, with its strong agri-food sector, climate-smart practices, and global reputation for quality, is well positioned to lead this agenda during its Presidency. Clear and predictable policy frameworks will give European companies the confidence to invest, scale, and innovate. To accelerate progress toward resilient and sustainable food systems, the Council could explore ways to reduce existing regulatory and fiscal obstacles—such as outdated schemes, inconsistent taxation, and restrictive product naming rules—that limit innovation and accessibility. Simplification efforts should focus on smarter, more efficient regulation that strengthens competitiveness and sustainability, rather than unintentionally weakening the green transition. Rolling back ambition risks undermining investor confidence and slowing company-led progress and incentives. Public health through nutritious, fiber-rich foods Increasing access to fiber-rich, nutritious food is one of the most cost-effective public health strategies available to the EU. Improving diets reduces disease burden and healthcare costs while supporting economic productivity. Procurement reform is one of the fastest ways to deliver visible progress to citizens."

This could be reflected in a slogan such as “Thriving together in a turbulent world” or “Thriving together in turbulent times” either of which could be shortened to Thriving Together. The Government could speak about the theme like this: We live in increasingly uncertain and turbulent times, globally. Resilience will be key to thriving in the coming decades and beyond. Many of the building blocks of the modern economic and political order can no longer be taken for granted, from global trade to international alliances, from secure energy supplies to a stable climate. Around Europe and the world we continually see people demonstrate resilience, courage and creativity in the face of these challenges. We saw it here Ireland in the wake of Storm Eowyn last year, when neighbours and communities came together to respond even before official aid could arrive. It showed the truth of the old Irish saying “Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine” – we live in each other’s shadows, sharing shelter and shade. That’s why during our EU Presidency we want to celebrate, support and strengthen the institutions and infrastructure - natural and social, physical and political – that underpin the resilience that Europe’s citizens, businesses and communities need to adapt and succeed in a changing world. We think “Resilience” as a theme chimes with new and existing narratives and initiatives being adopted by the EU. You hear repeated discussion of the need for the EU to develop its “Strategic Autonomy”, reflecting a number of concerns: a push for Europe not to depend on others for its security and defence for example, but also the need to stop relying on imported fossil fuels from unreliable regimes around the world, and the understanding that developing a more circular economy reduces our reliance on volatile supply chains for critical materials. The EU’s 2025 Strategic Foresight Report is actually called “Resilience 2.0: Empowering the EU to thrive amid turbulence and uncertainty” and captures the challenge well. Resilience as a framing has also received a significant push and much scientific underpinning from the recent work of the European Environment Agency (EEA). In their recent five-yearly State of the Environment report the agency appeals for “a broad understanding of security” that “captures not only defence, but also the resilience of vital societal functions that depend on our natural environment”. We think resilience provides a comprehensive, resonant and positive framing for Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union. It reflects, in a proactive way, the need to support people’s inherent ability to cope with the increasing uncertainty and volatility by strengthening our institutions and infrastructure to match the spirit of community Europe’s citizens demonstrate so often. For us in the Environmental Pillar this is part of wider transition that centres the elimination of pollution and the promotion of wellbeing as key metrics of successful, flourishing economies and societies."

While seeking to ensure regulation achieves its objectives efficiently is theoretically uncontroversial, in practice the process so far has been accompanied by a strong deregulation push that clearly risks undermining standards and outcomes for EU citizens and the environment. Some companies, industry alliances and their well-paid lobbyists (especially fossil fuel companies, big tech and chemical companies) are using this political pivot from the Commission to seek wholescale deregulation (in a “shock doctrine” style manipulation of current geopolitical and geo-economic turbulence). However, many experts, institutions and agencies, including the ECB for example, are warning that this is not in fact good for business as a whole, who benefit from regulatory certainty, and is essentially punishing those businesses that have invested in transition, is rewarding laggards and undermines the EU’s transition to long-term sustainability and prosperity. The Irish Presidency has a duty and an opportunity to uphold the future-oriented standard-setting that has epitomized EU innovation and protects citizens, our environment, and our common future. The new Multilateral Financial Framework must ensure adequate and dedicated funding for: nature restoration, to deliver the nature restoration law in partnership with farmers, communities and environmentalists; economically, socially and environmentally sustainable agriculture, including a “fully funded Pillar Two of CAP, including LEADER” as Minister Byrne put it to us recently; civil society and active citizenship, including continuing LIFE funding. The Circular Economy Act This is a real opportunity to enact legislation that makes a positive practical difference for consumers struggling with built-in obsolescence and entitled to a right-to-repair, addresses the supply chain challenges and critical-import dependence of European businesses, while also contributing to more sustainable resource use. 2040 Climate Package The Commission may table the formal proposals for the climate regime to achieve the 2040 climate target during the Irish Presidency. That is the equivalent of the Fit for 55 package for 2030, “Now for 90”? It is essential that the 2040 package is robust, does not weaken or unravel the current regime, and does not widen loopholes and flexibilities in a way that delays action or reduces momentum. It must also frame and deliver the transition is way that is fair, transparent and clearly addresses people’s immediate material concerns. That is both an imperative of a Just Transition and essential to avoid opportunistic opponents of climate action driving social division through disinformation and weaponization of climate measures based on fear and false information."

As would delivering practical, positive progress in the policy and legislative areas outlined in our answer to Question 2. And it must be progress that does not sacrifice transition, sustainability and resilience on the altar of short-term supposedly populist “vice signalling” or succumb to the pressure from huge business interests that want the EU to safeguard and serve their profits over the public good, or to pressure from state actors to the east and west that are seeking to undermine the European project and its stated values. Supporting civil society participation both on its own merits and to bolster the legitimacy and resonance of the European project is essential and we very much welcome Minister Byrne’s stated commitment in his meeting with the Environmental Pillar to championing the role of civil society across Europe, and his dismissal of some anti-civil society tropes as nonsense. Civil society space is under attack in various places around Europe, both geographic and ideological, and it is positive and essential that the Government is signalling its intention to uphold the long tradition of positive engagement with civil society during the Irish presidency of the EU. Supporting the development of the European Democracy Shield recently announced by Commissioner McGrath would be positive, especially the Stakeholder Platform of the new European Centre for Democratic Resilience to “to facilitate dialogue with trusted stakeholders such as civil society organisations, researchers and academia, fact-checkers and media providers” on three dimensions of the work: Safeguarding the integrity of the information space Strengthening our institutions, fair and free elections, and free and independent media Boosting societal resilience and citizens' engagement And supporting Irish civil society to ensure it has the capacity and opportunity to participate and contribute to the advancement of the three objectives under Commissioner McGrath’s EU Civil Society Strategy: Fostering engagement: A new Civil Society Platform will be established by 2026 to further facilitate dialogue on the protection and promotion of EU values. Support and protection: … including urgent assistance to organisations under threat, and coordination of available protection measures in Member States. Sustainable and transparent funding: … including the Commission [proposal] to significantly increase the financial support to CSOs, with €9 billion foreseen for the AgoraEU programme alone … as well as planning measures to facilitate access to different funding sources."

The Presidency plays an important role in forging consensus negotiating positions among the 27 member states. In line with the rest of this submission we would urge the Irish government to: Demonstrate and promote timely, structured and meaningful engagement with civil society before and during the COPs, at national and EU level, including ensuring civil society space is protected and supported at the COP venues. Seek EU negotiating positions and strategies that fulfil and advance the agreed objectives of the Conventions with urgency and in a manner that enables people and nature to thrive. Getting our own house in order We believe the run into the Presidency is an opportune moment to pull out all the stops to ensure Ireland has its own house in order on legal compliance before it presides over one of the Union’s three legislative branches. We look forward to engaging further on this in the coming months with regard to cases such as the “transposition deficit” in the energy area highlighted by the Climate Change Advisory Council in relation to the Fit for 55 package, and the issues highlighted below: We want to reiterate the issues raised by our partner, the Fair Seas Campaign: Despite repeated commitments over the past five years, Ireland currently ranks among the lowest-performing EU Member States in both the designation and effective management of MPAs. This gap between commitment and implementation undermines Ireland’s credibility at a time when the EU is looking for concrete action to match political pledges. For Ireland to hold the Presidency with authority on marine issues, it is essential that the Government advance strong, fit-for-purpose national MPA legislation in advance of 2026. Such legislation is critical to ensuring that Ireland can meet its 30x30 obligations, and it will provide a solid foundation for shaping wider EU policy conversations during the Presidency. Equally important is the need to improve the management and conservation effectiveness of Ireland’s existing Natura 2000 marine sites under the Birds and Habitats Directives. Without significant enhancement of implementation and enforcement within these existing sites, achieving a meaningful 30% MPA network will not be possible. Progressing MPA designation, management and wider marine conservation reforms is not simply a matter of compliance. It is an opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate genuine leadership at both national and EU levels, to build credibility as an advocate for ocean protection, and to show that Ireland can deliver on the commitments it has championed publicly. Doing MPAs properly, i.e., their designation and management is grounded in science, community engagement and effective and ongoing management, would position Ireland as a respected and ambitious leader during its EU Presidency. For these reasons, we urge the Government to prioritise marine conservation and MPA implementation as a core workstream in the lead-up to, and throughout, Ireland’s EU Council Presidency in 2026. We equally want to reiterate the issues raised by our partner, the Sustainable Water Network (SWAN) Ireland’s record on water quality remains a persistent concern. The most recent EPA Water Quality in Ireland report shows that nearly half of monitored rivers and lakes are in less-than-good ecological status and the number of these is growing, while nitrate and phosphate pollution pressures are rising in many catchments. As a Presidency, Ireland will be expected to coordinate and advance negotiations on various water environment related files. However, ongoing EU infringement proceedings against Ireland under the WFD, the Habitats Directive, Drinking Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive risk undermining our credibility in convening discussions on Europe’s water future. Before taking the helm, the Government should take demonstrable steps to show progress in tackling agricultural pollution, upgrading wastewater infrastructure, and preventing physical damage to our waters. The recent ruling by the ECJ that Ireland is in breach of its obligations under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a case in point. Two significant steps Ireland could take in addressing this breach are: The exemption threshold for abstraction is way too high and should be dropped to at least 10m3 Review the Arterial Drainage Act as promised in the Water Action Plan so as to reduce the physical damage to our waterways in Ireland, such as dredging, draining and damage to habitats. Furthermore, Ireland must transition farmers off the nitrate’s derogation over the next three years. The science shows that Ireland’s water quality is declining and there are no evidence-based measures in Ireland’s Nitrates Action Programme that will improve water quality in three years to ensure Ireland gets the derogation again. This is unfair to farmers who will be once again brought to a cliff-edge economically. Ireland cannot hold credibility if it continues to plan to seek derogation while its lakes and rivers are dying, such as Lady’s Island’s lake, whose green polluted waters can be seen from space."

Agriculture underpins food security, rural economies, and environmental sustainability, yet it faces a demographic crisis: the average EU farmer is 57, and only 12% of EU farmers are under 40. Without generational renewal, Europe risks losing millions of farms by 2040, threatening food supply and rural vitality. The Presidency offers a unique opportunity to align with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024 – 2029 and the Green Deal by prioritising: Generational renewal in agriculture by advocating for measures that make farming accessible to young people and support the Commission’s goal to double the share of farmers under 40 by 2040 (12% to 24%). Climate-resilient food systems through advancing policies that embed regenerative agriculture and soil health into the post-2027 CAP. This would help ensure farming adapts to climate extremes while maintain productivity. Competitiveness and innovation – position agriculture as a driver of green growth through digital tools, precision farming, and sustainable practices, helping ensure that farmers can thrive economically while meeting environmental targets. Farming forms a key part of Ireland’s economy, society and cultural identity. It is a major contributor to the national economy, particularly through exports, and employs a significant portion of the domestic workforce. This situates Ireland’s Presidency perfectly to provide a clear leadership message: the future of farming is central to Europe’s resilience, sustainability, and prosperity."

Simplify administrative burdens for farmers, as proposed in the ‘Omnibus III’ package, while also safeguarding green ambitions. EU Strategy for Generational Renewal in Agriculture Drive adoption of measures such as the Young Farmer Starter Pack (With a potential €300,000 cap), improved access to credit via the European Investment Bank (EIB), and create a European Land Observatory to track land prices and combat speculation. Promote gender equality and rural young engagement through initiatives like Rural Youth Ambassadors. Regenerative Agriculture and Soil Health Embed regenerative practices into EU law and CAP eco-schemes. Advocate for transitional support, including technical assistance and fair pricing, to help farmers adopt sustainable methods. The Presidency should aim to sucre political agreement on these priorities and ensure that Europe’s farming sector is future-proofed against demographic decline and extreme weather."

McDonald’s are a key supporter of regenerative agriculture which reduces input costs, improves soil health, and enhances climate resilience.

This will illustrate how EU policies could enable young people to build careers in farming. Youth engagement – launch a ‘Future of Farming’ campaign during the Presidency, involving schools, agricultural colleges, Irish farmers, and Rural Youth Ambassadors to showcase EU support for generational renewal. Open dialogue – use social media, regional events, and other platforms to explain how CAP reform, sustainability initiatives, and rural development policies can benefit European citizens directly."

Where vaccines are available, vaccination should be mandatory and should be supported by public authorities. As Ministers of Agriculture have repeatedly stated, it is time for the EU to have a harmonised approach to animal vaccination. Such a strategy could help to lift “internal trade barriers” between Member States on vaccinated animals, promote support for the “free with vaccination” status globally, and promote preventive vaccination; EU Biotech Act 1 – Important for improving the competitiveness of the animal health sector, and for increasing and retaining innovation in medicines, vaccines and other animal health products in the EU (highly needed as explained above, even more as it seems that the Omnibus on “Food and Feed” won’t tackle the EU rules on veterinary medicinal products); EU Livestock Strategy: due to be published around Spring 2026. It has a potential to better highlight the essential role of livestock in Europe and to support the livestock sector. We believe that it can help livestock farmers with the necessary recognition and support needed to protect Europe’s herds/flocks against animal disease outbreaks; Financing: MFF (Multiannual Financial Framework) and CAP (Common Agriculture Policy) negotiations will take place during the Irish Presidency. We call on the Presidency to ensure that animal disease prevention and management receives sufficient funding (for farmers to invest in preventive monitoring tools, support with vaccination, and where needed – sufficient “crisis mechanisms” funding). Financing animal health will be one of the topics of the next General Assembly of the World Animal Health Organisation (WOAH). It seems that the evaluation of the Animal Health Law (to be finalised in Spring) will also suggest that reflection is needed on financing animal health. REACH proposal: under existing legislation, medicines are exempt from authorisation, but not from restrictions. This is creating numerous issues, mostly at manufacturing sites. In many cases, substitution is not (legally) possible, and restrictions therefore can severely disrupt manufacturing and supply of medicines – with the proposed PFAS restriction potentially driving manufacturing completely out of the EEA. Exempting medicines and their manufacturing from restrictions and maintaining the benefit-risk approach from Reg 2019/6 would be a solution to these issues. Global access to medicines: Animal health products were caught up in the US Administration’s “Section 232” investigation into pharmaceuticals. AnimalhealthEurope strongly believes that veterinary medicines were not the target of the US Administration. This is why we believe that veterinary medicines should be exempted from US tariffs intended to be imposed on human medicines, as they may face the imposition of the same tariffs as medicines for human use. This would otherwise have negative consequences on veterinarians, farmers and families with pets. For the same reason, it is essential to ensure the continued access to veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland."

In addition, some initiatives such as the EU Biotech Act have the potential to make the EU animal medicines industry more competitive and to attract and retain more talent and it is essential to include a more “One-Health – One Welfare” approach to policies), farmers (farmers who lose their herds/flocks to disease lose much more than their revenue, as farmers also lose years of investment in genetic selection), community (farmers who lose their animals due a disease outbreak might decide to leave the farming community altogether. In addition, managing disease outbreaks creates significant costs for public authorities and therefore for taxpayers – Commissioner Varhelyi recently stated that €1 spent in disease prevention is worth €3 in disease management). The animal health industry is a cornerstone of the EU economy, generating €8.9 billion in sales in 2024 in Europe, and supporting around 50,000 jobs in the region. Like for human medicines, the EU is also a global manufacturing hub for veterinary medicines (including vaccines) which are exported globally, including to the US. Veterinary medicines, vaccines and other animal health products extend to 300,000 veterinarians dependent on medicines for their daily work, helping 166 million European households with pets (that are often considered as part of the family and can deliver numerous health benefits for individuals and the society and should be supported by more pet inclusive policies), and supporting 3 million farms with livestock in keeping their animals protected against disease. However, there are not enough veterinarians, especially in some rural areas. Ensuring access to veterinary care and supporting a thriving veterinary sector therefore is essential."

Ireland has a rare opportunity to reorient the conversation: from regulatory accumulation to regulatory performance, from defensive industrial narratives to a proactive, pro-competitiveness agenda that actually delivers for European businesses and consumers. Double-Down on Tech Regulatory Simplification The strongest economies are those that deploy and consume digital technologies at scale. Cloud, AI, cybersecurity, data-driven services, and next-generation connectivity are not “sectors,” they are multipliers across the entire economy. Ireland should champion a Presidency centred on accelerating digital deployment as the EU’s primary competitiveness tool. This requires acknowledging a simple truth: many recent and upcoming EU tech rules are not yet fit for purpose. Implementation issues, internal inconsistencies, and overlapping obligations, across the DSA, DMA, Data Act, AI Act, sectoral rules, and national add-ons, create drag on innovation, compliance teams, and ultimately on Europe’s ability to scale new technologies. For consumers, this translates into patchy protection as companies are forced to guess their way from abstract prescriptions to meaningful and actionable steps built into functional products. Ireland should lead a systematic effort to examine what’s working and what needs corrective action. This should entail facilitating structured, continuous, cross-working-party discussions that match the scale and pace of the tech regulatory tsunami. The recent digital and AI “omnibus” proposals are only a start. The 2026 Presidency should focus on doubling down on simplifying, unifying, and clarifying rules so as to land on a coherent approach to enforcement and guidance. The goal: restore predictability, coherence, and a functioning Digital Single Market. Make Europe a Customer-First Digital Market The current push for “Buy European” mandates and other forms of technology protectionism such as network usage fees might be politically opportune for a few actors, but economically self-defeating for all. Aggressive procurement quotas or access restrictions would inflate public-sector costs, limit access to cutting-edge cloud and AI solutions, and deepen the EU’s technological lag. They would offer no meaningful “sovereignty,” just higher prices and slower innovation on the market for customers. Real digital sovereignty comes from diversification and choice. Europe should prioritise open markets, competitive procurement, and interoperability that prevents vendor lock-in. Sovereignty should never become a subsidy for firms that failed to compete or innovate. Customer buy-in is competitive companies’ north star, and industrial policy built on artificial mandates rather than genuine market demand will fail. Tailored solutions for mission-critical use cases will always exist where customers need them. But while Europe’s concerns about supply-chain risks, extraterrititorial data-access laws, and economic sanctions spillovers are understood, unilateral market-access restrictions will be ineffective, especially for European businesses operating abroad which are subject to foreign laws by definition. The upcoming Irish Presidency should advance discussions with Member States, urging the Commission to pursue coordinated legal architecture with like-minded international partners to resolve cross-border legal tensions at their source, set predictable guardrails, and establish cooperative channels that keep essential digital services from becoming collateral damage."

Legislative focus: The Presidency should advance simplify and ensure coherence across digital rules, including through a swift adoption of the proposed Digital Omnibus and ensuring that the EU Council actively contributes to the broader Digital Fitness Check. Furthermore, upcoming legislation such as the Delivery Act and the Product Act should ensure greater legal certainty. Work on the Environmental Omnibus and Circular Economy Act must focus on simplifying green policies to actively support Europe’s competitiveness.

Ensuring a stable and open digital single market Maintaining the stability and principle-based nature of the Digital Single Market is paramount. Legislative focus: A key task will be coordinating the Council’s response to the DMA Review to ensure that implementation and enforcement are predictable and fair. The Presidency should convene several thematic working party meetings to discuss the various aspects of DMA implementation and enforcement, building upon the initial discussion hosted by the Cypriot Presidency following the publication of the DMA Review report. The Presidency should also encourage careful scrutiny of the upcoming Digital Networks Act (DNA) during negotiations, ensuring it adheres to the principles of net neutrality and firmly rejects proposals that would covertly introduce network usage fees. The Presidency is also urged to ensure thorough scrutiny over revisions of consumer laws such the upcoming Digital Fairness Act (DFA), to prioritise enforcement of existing rules and avoid duplication. The Presidency should ensure that the Council weighs in on the review of the Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) to slash over notification of financial contributions to ensure that limited enforcement is focused on truly distortive practices. • Achievement aim: The Presidency must safeguard a level playing field by firmly rejecting nontechnical or exclusionary market restrictions, such as sovereignty criteria (relevant to discussions around the Cybersecurity Act or the Cloud and AI Development Act) and discriminatory financial data access rules (FiDA), which only raise costs and reduce choice for Europeans. 3.

Layers of new rules, from DSA, DMA, AI Act, Data Act, and cybersecurity laws, to consumer and environmental rules, are creating uncertainty, inconsistent enforcement, and operational friction for organisations of all sizes. The Council can make a real difference by: Expanding the EU’s simplification drive beyond narrow Omnibus packages and embedding it across all digital, competition, and sustainability files. Synchronising implementation timelines and avoiding contradictory obligations that particularly strain SMEs and public administrations. Driving enforcement coherence, ensuring regulators in all Member States apply rules consistently so businesses no longer need to navigate 27 interpretations of the same law. For citizens, this translates into safer, more reliable digital services. For businesses, it means the ability to invest, innovate, and scale in Europe rather than abroad. Safeguard an open, competitive, demand-driven Digital Single Market Communities benefit most when they have access to high-quality digital infrastructure, competitive cloud and AI services, and affordable connectivity. The Council should therefore: Reject discriminatory market-access restrictions, sovereignty quotas, and network fees that raise costs and reduce choice for schools, hospitals, small companies, and local authorities. Keep policymaking grounded in technical evidence, not industrial protectionism. Support the Digital Networks Act and connectivity initiatives in a way that accelerates cloud and AI deployment and preserves net neutrality. An open, competitive Single Market ensures people everywhere, from rural regions to major cities, gain access to the best technologies at the lowest cost. Build trustworthy, safe, and inclusive digital environments The Presidency can strengthen online trust by ensuring that future child-safety, privacy, and cybersecurity workstreams remain risk-based, interoperable, and consistent with existing frameworks like the DSA. Fragmentation or overreach would undermine rather than enhance safety. Ireland should champion: Evidence-based youth protection, empowering young users without forcing intrusive ageverification regimes. Proportionate cybersecurity rules that raise resilience without shutting out international providers essential to public-sector continuity. Implementation clarity on the AI Act, providing guidance that helps small organisations adopt AI responsibly and confidently. In short, the Council can deliver the greatest positive impact by making the EU’s rulebook work in practice, reducing friction, preserving choice, enabling deployment, and ensuring that every community can benefit from fast, safe, innovative digital services."

The housing crisis affects not just Ireland but all member states. In her 2025 State of the European Union speech, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the housing crisis as a social crisis which tears at Europe's social fabric, weakens our cohesion and threatens our competitiveness. The EU institutions are taking unprecedented action to tackle this crisis; the European Commission appointed its first Commissioner with responsibility for housing, who will soon publish the first ever European Affordable Housing Plan, and the European Parliament convened a special committee on the housing crisis, with two Irish MEPs serving as Vice-Chairs. The Danish Presidency (July – December 2025) adopted conclusions regarding the forthcoming Affordable Housing Plan, including calling on the Commission to “focus equally on affordability and sustainability in the efforts to increase housing supply where needed, while also ensuring a good level of quality in healthy, safe … accessible and resilient places to live”. Ireland can use its Presidency to push for the same level of urgency at the Council. While Ireland and many other member states are under huge pressure to ramp up the supply of homes, we must not lose sight of the fact that housing and health are intrinsically linked. Healthy Homes Ireland’s 2023 report, ‘Towards Healthier Greener Homes’, identified a number of studies that demonstrate the impact that poor Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) can have on health; for example, cold, mould, and poor ventilation are linked to increased risk of respiratory illnesses, while lack of daylight can impact mental well-being. When we invest in good quality homes, we are also investing in our public health, our physical and mental wellbeing, and our social cohesion. Ambitious housing targets and healthy design can be pursued together with good collaboration and forward thinking. Getting the balance right between affordability and health and sustainability is an important challenge with the EU must be aware of as it moves to address the housing crisis. The European Housing Advisory Board recommended that affordability of housing should be defined by the lifetime cost of buildings, not just purchase or rental prices. It emphasised that buildings with good health performance indicators such as good indoor air quality and sufficient daylight provide health benefits and reduce wider societal and healthcare costs. Buildings are the single largest energy consumer in Europe, with around 40% of total energy consumption attributable to buildings. Decarbonising housing stock is crucial to the EU meeting its climate targets, which ought to be seen as both an obligation to future generations and a chance to transform our economies and communities for the better. The EU has a vital role to play in supporting member states achieve this transition. As the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive highlights, renovation for energy performance purposes is also a prime opportunity to address other aspects such as indoor environmental quality."
275,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6da8e87a/Healthy_Homes_Ireland_-_Submission_275.docx,Healthy Homes Ireland,Civil society group,Built environment and health,National,2,"The first European Affordable Housing Plan will be published by the end of 2025. Ireland’s Presidency should focus on implementing the actions set out in the plan to unlock greater housing delivery, while ensuring that there is no compromise between affordability and health or sustainability. In particular, Ireland should facilitate discussions on turning vacant and derelict buildings into homes, which will be one of the key aspects of the Affordable Housing Plan. This is an area where governments can share information and learn from successful examples across European cities and regions. Furthermore, Ireland should prioritise the proposed update to State aid rules to make it possible for EU Member States to support affordable housing in a faster and simpler way, as outlined in the European Commission Work Programme 2026. Members states are due to transpose the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive into national law by May 2026, and during Ireland’s Presidency, governments will be finalising their respective National Building Renovation Plans. This will be an important opportunity for collaboration and for member states to share best practices. As Council President, Ireland will have an important role to play by ensuring that governments have the necessary support from the EU to deliver the European Renovation Wave and improve living standards for citizens across Europe. Ireland can use its Presidency of the Council to advance the goal of delivering healthier, greener homes for the future by convening ministerial meetings on housing across different Council configurations, including the Environment Council, Competitiveness Council, and the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council. Ireland should also push to host the first EU Housing Summit during its Presidency."
275,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6da8e87a/Healthy_Homes_Ireland_-_Submission_275.docx,Healthy Homes Ireland,Civil society group,Built environment and health,National,3,"Putting a strong focus on delivering healthier, greener homes for the future during the term of the Irish Presidency will make the most substantial positive impact for people, businesses and communities across the EU. The population of developed countries spends approximately 60% of their time at home. A healthy home has a huge positive impact on people’s physical and mental wellbeing. With governments across the EU preparing to deliver millions of new homes, and retrofit millions of existing buildings, the work of this Council has the potential to positively impact future generations. Healthy homes are also more energy efficient which can help to address energy poverty which is a growing problem in both Ireland and across the EU. As noted in the Housing Commission report, the positive health impacts of addressing the performance of buildings are usually felt more by socio-economically disadvantaged households. Therefore, actions such as implementing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive should be seen as part of a Just Transition towards a climate neutral economy. By focusing on healthy homes, the Council can support startups, scaleups and small businesses to thrive. The Renovation Wave aims to renovate 35 million buildings by 2030. Delivering on this ambition will mean upskilling the construction workforce across Europe and creating new, sustainable jobs for the future. It will mean developing new green technologies and Modern Methods of Construction. It will mean increasing technical assistance to regional and local actors. These new industries are developing across the EU. Through cooperation, facilitated by Ireland’s Presidency, member states can help new businesses scale up, taking advantage of the Single Market. This will create growth and bolster Europe’s competitiveness. And it will accelerate the green transition across all EU countries, to the benefit of all citizens. Healthy Homes Ireland recognises that in addition to the quality of the home itself, a healthy home is well connected to the local community, green space, and sustainable transport options. Remote and hybrid working are common occurrences in Ireland, as in the rest of the EU. Therefore a healthy home also has a positive business impact for the wider economy. During the Irish Presidency, the Council’s work should consider how we create the communities and neighbourhoods of the future. The European Commission has said that 2026 must be Europe’s Independence Moment. Addressing the European housing crisis is critical, and Ireland must use its Presidency to ensure that this is high on the agenda."

The cost to Ireland has been calculated at an average of €4.65 billion annually. Putting this issue to the forefront and integrating it into all Governmental Departments, and across the work of all EU bodies, in a whole of society approach can bring great benefits for all. Quality employment is important to achieve this and is appropriately highlighted at EU level, but it is not enough on its own. There needs to be an addressing of the structural reasons why some groups are especially vulnerable to poverty and targeted measures to address this. One of the keyways of addressing this is through the provision of public services. The fiscal rules need to be examined in this context. For example, housing and transport problems are having an impact on employers ‘ability to attract and retain workers. Investment in public housing and transport can have a positive impact across the board. Relying on economic growth is not appropriate, particularly in the context of the challenges of climate change. The harsh impact of climate change is visible in all member states and will only get worse. Taking steps to deal with this also needs to be integrated into all of the work of the Union, and the Council must drive this approach."

Undoubtedly there will be major events organized in Dublin and other cities, but there should be a targeted approach to rural areas which feel abandoned and neglected, as well as a focus on disadvantaged areas in the cities. These are the communities that are most alienated and feel most left behind. Linking in to these communities directly, not just working with established Non-Governmental Organisations who are already well connected and informed about the EU, is vital. Community organisations are key in this. Nominating a number of areas where more grass-roots type information events could take place on the Anti-poverty Strategy for example, would generate interest and important participation. There should be efforts made to connect ordinary citizens from other EU member states to some events in Ireland. For example, the European Anti-Poverty Network, which we are affiliated to along with 31 other European countries, is hosting their annual assembly of people experiencing poverty in Cyprus, to link in with the Cypriot Presidency. The possibility of organizing a related event in Ireland during our Presidency involving ordinary citizens from across the EU would allow Irish communities to link in with their European peers and in many ways can have a more powerful impact than the higher-level meetings. The Commission and our European organization can assist in such events."

This will be closely aligned to the beginning of the negotiations on the Skills Portability Initiative which the European Commission is putting forward. This is one of the greatest challenges preventing Europeans from accessing full mobility across the EU, for them to ensure that they have social mobility, and also can significantly contribute to further participation in learning, developing a true culture of lifelong learning. Ireland’s historic approach to community-based holistic learning is a model that the Presidency can put forward to contribute to unlocking the potential of all Europeans. This theme can also touch upon the upcoming EU VET Strategy, and can also contribute to the mobility of teachers and trainers for the upcoming EU Teachers and Trainers Agenda. This would also respond to the findings of the European Commission Evaluation of the implementation of the Upskilling Pathways Council Recommendation. The way in which validation and recognition lags at national level across many countries, reveals once more the blockage on this side. This area requires particular attention, as we now see this as identified as one of the highest challenges across multiple sectors of activity in the EU. Furthermore, a focus on validation and recognition will also implicitly involve reaching out to those most disadvantaged in society to have their experiences validated and to have them encouraged to engage in more learning. These people are identified as those most in need for further learning, yet also those the least likely to engage in education and training. This can further boost equity across the EU, while also being a great opportunity for the Irish Presidency to showcase some of its most crucial developments: the new National Skills Council, Ireland’s National Skills Strategy 2025, as well as its Adult Literacy for Life (ALL) Strategy."

This particular file might bring a rare opportunity for a legislative proposal in the field of education and training. In this sense, civil society in the field of education and training wishes to have a strong Presidency to ensure that the principle of subsidiarity is respected, while, more concrete collaboration can be established between the EU Member States when it comes to recognition and validation of skills. There is a multitude of initiatives and tools at the EU level which need further coordination and the Irish Presidency, based on its vast national experience in policy coherence and engagement of stakeholders across sectors, can facilitate a process to better bring together Europass, the EU Competence Frameworks, ESCO, the European Digital Learning Model, and create services which are more easy to navigate by end users and stakeholders across the EU. The Irish Presidency would be ideally placed to negotiate a Council Recommendation on Lifelong Guidance, as this is a central piece missing in the EU strategies, and sometimes across Member States, as a type of action which can support learners continue their learning journey, and also to strengthen the presence of learners in underrepresented pathways for learning, such as VET. It will be without doubt that the Irish Presidency will be working on the MFF negotiations, with the expected compromise agreement to be defined during this mandate. In this context, this is an opportunity to ensure policy coherence across the MFF, so that the different programmes which contribute to education and training can be better aligned, and simplified for the beneficiaries, rather than for the European Commission only. To this end, a strong Erasmus+ programme is needed, and Ireland is a key beneficiary of this programme which can further raise the standing of Erasmus+ in this negotiation when there is a risk to water down the programme at the expense of other existing short-term priorities. The Irish Presidency can also continue the push on the implementation of the Council Recommendation on Individual Learning Accounts, considering how these are serving all the topics mentioned across these responses, while as well they seem to be quite successfully piloted across multiple EU Member States. A crucial innovative element that the Irish Presidency can pick up during the mandate considering that the Commission is less likely to do so is the idea of Community Lifelong Learning Centres. This Cedefop-researched tool is mentioned in the Union of Skills as an objective to explore community-based learning. Judging from Ireland excellent community-based learning culture, which combines a wide variety of education and training providers, reaching out to learners of all ages in intergenerational learning fashion, it would be essential to see the Irish Presidency spearhead a Council Recommendation on community learning opportunities, or to push an initiative on the topic. This can be an essential tool also for developing basic skills beyond formal education. Many generations currently miss basic skills, and formal education cannot cover all these needs."

Ensuring the human right of access to learning at all stages of life and in all environments, and focusing on initiatives linked to this, can ensure the greatest impact on people and communities across the EU, with cascading positive impact for businesses. Moreover, the involvement of stakeholder representative organisations in the meetings of the Council are also crucial to identify what are the people's needs on the ground and how EU-level policies address this. To this end, it is essential for the Irish Presidency to promote the involvement of stakeholders in the current EU governance mechanisms. For education and training, it is crucial that the Irish Presidency promotes the involvement of representatives of all stakeholders in education and training in the High Level Skills Board of the Union of Skills, while it also opens the door of the High-Level Group of the European Education Area to the stakeholders organisations. The goals of EU Member States governments and stakeholders are aligned: bringing positive impact to all Europeans.

Moreover, most of the initiatives above focus on the needs of learners, and the clear communication of initiatives aligned to support these needs. To this end, the selection of priorities for the Irish Presidency needs to be aligned with what people immediately need. The current EU-level narrative on competitiveness does not necessarily speak to people’s realities. However, a focus on upgrading their competences can meet the EU needs on competitiveness, while definitely speaking more to the immediate reality of people."

This allows people to be reached in their own community, with tailored learning opportunities. Parents can leave their children in learning opportunities, while pursuing their own learning journey. Ireland is credited in the paper for its community-based one-stop-shop practices (like ‘Familibase’, in Ballyfermot, Dublin, which constitutes a ground-breaking initiative).The overall culture of on community-based learning in Ireland resonates with this initiative, and it would be just fitting that the Irish Presidency picks up on an initiative that showcases how innovative community-based learning practices can be.

This is an opportunity for the EU to learn, and for Ireland to learn from some good practices out there too. A strong platform for patient groups and citizens alliances to share data ,and strategies to protect vulnerable children in particular against anaphylaxis is something Ireland should seriously consider with its Presidency. Taking into account the current geopolitical and socioeconomic context in Europe, we recommend that Ireland prioritise Health Protection, Citizen Safety, and Resilient Societies as core themes of its 2026 Presidency. Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. At the same time, the Presidency should advance efforts to strengthen global pharmaceutical supply chains and advance international partnerships, building on Ireland’s role as a leading exporter and a critical hub in global manufacturing. Delivering more secure and resilient supply will reinforce Europe’s health preparedness while supporting the EU’s competitiveness agenda. 1. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger community-level preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy development within the European Health Union framework, particularly in relation to preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. In parallel, the Presidency should prioritise strengthening global pharmaceutical supply chains. Given Ireland’s position as a leading pharmaceutical exporter and a critical node in global manufacturing, Ireland is well-placed to drive EU efforts to enhance supply chain security and resilience. Advancing international partnerships and more secure supply routes would help ensure reliable access to medicines across Europe, while also supporting the Union’s economic competitiveness and bolstering overall health resilience. 2. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. In parallel, Ireland can leverage its leadership in pharmaceutical manufacturing to advance international partnerships that supports reliable access to essential medicines and drives collaboration on health innovation. Strengthening cooperation with global will reinforce the EU’s strategic position in health innovation while underlining Ireland’s role as a trusted bridge between European and global pharmaceutical ecosystem."

Key priorities include: 1. Health Protection and Emergency Preparedness Serious allergies and anaphylaxis present a growing public-health challenge. The Presidency could: Promote timely access to emergency medicines, building on Ireland’s approach where pharmacists can supply life-saving treatment without prescription. Encourage harmonised school and public-venue preparedness, using Ireland as an example. Relevant upcoming EU initiative: Global health resilience initiative (non-legislative, Q2 2026) – to strengthen EU capacity for rapid response to health crises. The global supply chain continues to be the best structure for maximising efficient, economical and resilient access to medical products. The Presidency should promote enhanced global supply chain functionality and promote open trade and international collaboration within the framework of the Critical Medicines Act (legislative) and the revision of the EU Public Procurement Directive (legislative, Q2 2026). 2. Digital Innovation for Health Cross-border emergencies require seamless access to patient data: Promote the European Health Data Space for secure, interoperable sharing of health information, enabling faster response to anaphylactic events across borders. Support digital tools for citizen-centred care, enhancing emergency response and patient safety. 3. Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (non-legislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Reinforce global pharmaceutical supply chains and deepen international partnership. By focusing on these targeted initiatives, Ireland can use its Presidency to deliver practical, measurable impacts on citizen safety, health equity, and cross-border emergency preparedness while reinforcing the EU’s social and legal frameworks."

For individuals with serious allergies, policies that improve emergency response, access to medicines, and accurate allergen information can be life-saving. For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. Additionally, strengthening supply-chain resilience not only supports uninterrupted access to critical medicines across the EU, but also creates a more predictable operating environment for industry. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives. Replicating Ireland’s best practice on emergency medicine access would ensure that life-saving intervention is available regardless of where a reaction occurs, reducing inequalities across Member States."

The 2026 Presidency can show how EU cooperation protects people, strengthens communities, and makes daily life safer—particularly in areas such as emergency preparedness for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. 1. Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. 2. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. 3. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. This people-centred framing will strengthen public trust, build ownership, and demonstrate the concrete value of Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

Could it be used to mainstream the understanding amongst Europeans that tobacco control measures are also climate action that benefit people and the planet? A large majority of Europeans view climate change as a serious global threat, with 85% of citizens identifying it as a major problem (EU Barometer, 2025) but do people understand that tobacco control legislation such as increased cigarette pricing, taxation and age-of-sale policies that have benefitted the health of people (Teshima et al, 2025) have also benefitted the planet?

During a phase-down period we would like to see urgent action to introduce very strong e-cigarette regulation, in line with the recommendations of our colleagues in Irish Heart Foundation, ASH Ireland and EU Smoke Free partnership below. During phase-down, Trinity requests that any taxes from e-cigarettes be allocated to educational institutions like Trinity that are trying to deal with the litter, waste disposal, addiction and illness on campus caused by e-cigarette use. Trinity is intentionally using the terms ‘phase-down’, ‘phased out’ to reflect the language used during COP 28 about fossil fuels. In a climate crisis, Trinity believes e-cigarettes are too harmful to people and the planet to be allowed, except in controlled situations. Irish Heart Foundation and ASH Ireland would like the following action on cigarettes: Increase the legal age of sale of tobacco products. Price increases for all tobacco products. Comprehensive smoking cessation programmes. Denicotinisation of tobacco products Stronger smuggling controls. Smoke-free outdoor spaces And the following actions on e-cigarettes: Ban the import, manufacture, and sale of single-use or disposable vapes. Introduce a ban on vape flavours, except tobacco flavour. Introduce a complete ban on all forms of vape advertisements, including Point-of-Sale (POS) and online. Introduce plain packaging for vapes Ban the online sale of vapes Increase the legal age of sale of all forms of e-cigarettes to 21 EU Smoke Free Partnership would like to strengthen the EU Tobacco Tax Directive to: Increase RYO (roll-your-own) tobacco tax to €287/kg in order to close the price gap with factory-made cigarettes. Adjust HTP (heated tobacco product) taxation to reflect actual stick weight (0.3g) and set a fair tax rate of €360/kg. Tax HTPs at the same rate as cigarettes to prevent misleading “less harmful” perceptions and increase revenue. Harmonise the tax base across all tobacco and nicotine products using weighted average retail price to ensure fairness and reduce evasion. Apply a single excise rate for all e-cigarette liquids, regardless of nicotine strength, to simplify enforcement. Adjust taxes annually based on GDP growth instead of every three years using the consumer price index. Shorten transitional periods for taxes on cigars, HTPs, e-cigarettes, and other products to ensure timely public health impact."

In assessing the Commission's CAP regulation and supporting documentation, there is no doubt that we are looking at the most radical reform for over twenty years. Ireland is currently receiving €1.5 billion per annum under both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. Under the current proposals for the period 2028/2034, this figure could substantially fall to €1.17 billion. Ireland should be campaigning for an increased CAP budget, over and above the current budget, to take account of inflation.

Threats to human health and well-being, to food production and security, and to energy security, are clearly described in the European Environment Agency (EEA) European Climate Risk Assessment (EEA Report 01/2024), and in United Nations Environment Programme (2025); Global Environment Outlook 7: A future we choose – Why investing in Earth now can lead to a trillion-dollar benefit for all. The UNEP report urges us to tackle the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation, and pollution and waste as one. The European Green Deal aims to transform the EU's economy for a sustainable future. EU climate and energy policies should better integrate both climate mitigation and adaptation into the planning and implementation of measures in the energy sector. This will help actors at EU, national, local, community, and at individual level, to meet objectives on energy system decarbonisation and security of supply (European Climate Risk Assessment Report). The development and implementation of policies that increase resilience to climate change need to be an essential part of EU climate and energy actions, including integrated national energy and climate plans (NECPs). The EU Strategic Agenda 2024 to 2029 includes a suite of objectives for making a success of the green transition, providing a stable and predictable framework and a more supportive environment for scaling up Europe’s manufacturing capacity for net-zero technologies and products. Policy coherence will be very important to achieve the 2024 to 2029 objectives, in the context of atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases that are still increasing, accelerating climate change and the associated risks and existential threats reported by UNEP and EEA. There is considerable potential for zero carbon renewable (green) hydrogen (Renewable Fuel of Non-biological Origin RFNBO) to replace fossil and other greenhouse gas emitting fuels, to assist in meeting increasingly onerous 2030, 2040 and 2050 climate action decarbonisation targets. It is submitted that the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union should prioritise the implementation of policy actions that accelerate the production, distribution, end uses, and storage of zero carbon renewable (green) hydrogen (RFNBO). Greenhouse gas emissions abatement can be facilitated by the use of both electricity and green hydrogen as zero carbons fuels, in all sectors of the European economy. Green hydrogen production can support and balance renewable electricity generation and energy grid systems, making use of curtailed renewable wind and solar power. Direct non-grid connected green hydrogen electrolysis using renewable wind and solar energy should also be enabled, to facilitate zero carbon fuel production where electricity grid is absent or inadequate. Ireland should promote these measures for immediate implementation throughout the European Union."

Green hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is urgently required at scale throughout the EU, to make hydrogen a viable and cost efficient zero carbon fuel for both light and heavy duty vehicles, and to support and provide certainty to hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) and hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle developers and manufacturers in the European Union (Global Hydrogen Mobility Alliance). Europe shouldn’t rely on one technology for transport. Combining green hydrogen and battery technologies is faster, cheaper, and more resilient, as well as saving up to €500 billion in infrastructure cost. The current policy focus on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) also excludes many fleet and individual vehicle operators from decarbonising their transport, because their range, payload and vehicle availability requirements cannot be met by BEVs. The current policy of restricting end uses of renewable hydrogen places greater demand on electricity production and increases long term hydrogen storage requirement. In many sectors, it may be more efficient and cost effective to use hydrogen directly as a zero carbon fuel. The development and implementation of the Public Procurement Act, scheduled for 2026, should promote and provide access to zero carbon green hydrogen as well as to zero carbon electricity as fuels and energy carriers. The provision of supports to the production, distribution and use of these zero carbon fuels should be facilitated by policy initiatives, and supported by the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies which is scheduled to commence during Ireland’s Presidency of the European Council, transferring funds to zero carbon energy and materials.

Storm, heat wave and other disruptions to electricity grids and supply are increasing in frequency. These policy measures can contribute to the development of the EU climate package for the decade ahead. Evaluation of the fertilising products Regulation should consider the risks to cross-compliance and policy coherence of promoting artificial fertiliser production and use as part of a green hydrogen economy. Existing Climate Action Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) objectives at risk include: Agriculture sector nitrous oxide emission reduction targets low/no N fertiliser systems targets for organic farming (10% by 2030) resilience and biodiversity measures including use of mixed swards risk of being not consistent with Global Biodiversity Framework or Nature Restoration requirements, and requirements for the protection of soils. With regard to biofuels, it would be useful for the Irish Presidency of the European Council to confirm that biofuels are not zero carbon fuels. Biofuels do emit greenhouse gases when used as fuels, and they do not contribute directly to decarbonisation. Their classification as renewable depends on consideration of potential policy coherence risks. UNEP reporting notes that large-scale deployment of biofuels generates trade-offs related to land, water, and fertilizer demand with implications for food security and biodiversity conservation, which may substantially constrain sustainable expansion of bioenergy cropland with or without carbon capture and storage (IPCC 2023b; Deprez et al. 2024; Braun et al. 2025). Bearing this in mind, and given the adverse climate change related impacts on food production in the EU, particularly in Southern Europe which grows and exports food throughout the EU, policy development should not expect that biofuel production can be expanded either within Europe or globally. While locally biofuels do contribute to the circular economy, biofuels should no longer be seen as a beneficial transition away from fossil fuels, to be followed in the longer term by the decarbonising fuel green hydrogen. Green hydrogen policies must be implemented within the European Union now, as a matter of urgency, and scaled up rapidly during the remaining period of the 2024 to 2029 Strategic Agenda. The development of the climate package for the decade ahead should include significant upward revision of national targets for green hydrogen production and use in decarbonising all sectors of the European economy."

Hydrogen FCEVs may be particularly well-suited to ambulances, fire tenders, police fleet, taxis, public transport, first responders and other emergency services, because with quick re-fuelling, these vehicles can support multiple work shifts /24 hour availability, thus reducing vehicle purchase costs. There are various non-transport uses for renewable hydrogen that would be relevant to citizens, including: dispatchable generation, combined heat and power plant, hydrogen cookers, boilers, water heaters, and hydrogen gas space heaters. Hydrogen ready equipment and appliances are available and could be included for consideration in GPP under the following category- Energy Related Products, Heating Equipment, Indoor and Outdoor Lighting. The potential role of renewable hydrogen fuelled back-up power generation could be considered in the context of providing climate change resilience to the provision of public services, as well as to communities and individual citizens."

In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefitsharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
89,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/524e886a/Gort_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_89.docx,Gort Biogas Concern Group,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “peoplecentred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, communityled projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."

Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agriinvestors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industryspecific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."

FORUM Connemara recommends that Ireland’s high-level themes reflect Ireland’s strengths as a rural, coastal and community-driven nation, and address the long-term social, economic, and environmental challenges facing the EU. We propose the following three thematic priorities: 1. Thriving Rural and Coastal Communities in a Balanced Europe As an island nation with a strong rural identity, Ireland is well positioned to champion an EU vision that places rural and coastal communities at the centre of policymaking. This theme would prioritise territorial cohesion, local development, and the implementation of the EU Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas. It would highlight the role of community-led local development (CLLD), social enterprise, and digital infrastructure in ensuring that rural citizens enjoy equitable access to opportunities. A Presidency under this theme would promote inclusive policies that reduce regional disparities, strengthen rural economies, support island and coastal communities, and ensure that no area of Europe is left behind. 2. A Just and Community-Led Climate Transition Ireland can lead by advocating for a climate transition that is socially fair, locally grounded, and economically inclusive. This theme would address the practical realities faced by rural communities as Europe moves toward decarbonisation, biodiversity restoration, and climate adaptation. It would place emphasis on nature-based solutions, sustainable agriculture, community energy projects, and climate resilience for remote regions. Central to this priority is the principle that communities must be partners in environmental transformation, with clear supports, funding, and guidance that enable them to adapt while maintaining sustainable livelihoods. 3. Social Inclusion, Skills and Opportunities for All Communities Building an inclusive Europe requires policies that support vulnerable groups, enhance skills, and ensure access to essential services. Ireland could use its Presidency to prioritise lifelong learning, digital inclusion, youth engagement, labour market activation, and the development of social enterprises that strengthen local economies. A focus on inclusion would also help address challenges linked to demographic change, migration, and persistent disadvantage in both urban and rural areas. By elevating social inclusion as a core EU priority, Ireland would reaffirm the principle that sustainable economic growth must be accompanied by strong, resilient communities. These three high-level themes—rural and coastal thriving, a just climate transition, and social inclusion and skills—are mutually reinforcing and reflect Ireland’s values, strengths, and national priorities. Together they provide a forward-looking, people-centred vision of Europe that supports balanced regional development, empowers communities, and equips citizens and local areas to meet the challenges and opportunities of the decade ahead."

As a community development organisation working across a geographically peripheral, rural, and Gaeltacht region, we believe Ireland is uniquely positioned to champion policy areas that strengthen territorial cohesion, social inclusion, and sustainable rural futures across the European Union. 1. Rural Development, Territorial Cohesion & the Future of Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) Ireland’s Presidency should support a renewed EU-wide emphasis on rural and remote communities through the implementation of the Long-Term Vision for Rural Areas and the evolution of CLLD post-2027. The Presidency could seek to advance legislative proposals that enhance multi-funded CLLD approaches, increase local decision-making powers, and reduce administrative burdens that currently inhibit community organisations from delivering programmes effectively. In line with the Multi-Finaical Framework (MFF) Ireland should prioritise a more flexible, outcomes-based regulatory framework in the next CAP and Cohesion Policy periods, ensuring that rural development tools genuinely reflect local contexts and enable innovation. 2. Climate Adaptation, Biodiversity & Just Transition for Rural Areas The Presidency should emphasise policy mechanisms that help rural regions adapt to climate change in ways that are socially and economically equitable. FORUM Connemara encourages a focus on scaling nature-based solutions, community-led climate adaptation projects, and support for low-carbon local enterprises. Legislative progress is needed in implementing the EU Nature Restoration Law, particularly in providing clear guidance, dedicated funding, and community engagement structures that ensure rural stakeholders are partners—not bystanders—in environmental change. Ireland can also lead on defining what a Just Transition means for small and peripheral communities, beyond the current sector-focused approach. 3. Social Inclusion, Skills & Community Empowerment The Irish Presidency should work to strengthen EU frameworks supporting social inclusion, adult and lifelong learning, youth engagement, service for people with disabilities and services that address persistent disadvantage. Legislative priorities may include enhancing ESF+ measures for upskilling people distant from the labour market, expanding access to digital and community services, and promoting models of social enterprise that generate local employment. Ireland could also champion an EU-level commitment to supporting community infrastructure in rural and island regions, improving equal access to services and opportunities. 4. Blue Economy, Islands & Coastal Communities As an island nation with extensive coastal and fishing communities, Ireland can use its Presidency to highlight the needs of the EU’s maritime periphery. Renewed emphasis is needed on sustainable fisheries, marine biodiversity, and diversification opportunities for coastal economies. Ireland should promote legislative proposals that ensure rural and island communities share in the long-term value created by the blue economy. The 2026 Presidency offers Ireland a strategic opportunity to shape an EU that is more inclusive, balanced, community-led, and sustainable. FORUM Connemara encourages a Presidency programme that puts rural communities, social cohesion, and local empowerment at the centre of Europe’s future policy direction."
314,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a45a2dbf/FORUM_Connemara_CLG_-_Submission_314.docx,FORUM Connemara CLG,Local Development Company,Rural Development,Connemara area of County Galway.,3,"FORUM Connemara believes that the Irish Presidency can deliver the most meaningful positive impact by championing policies and approaches that place communities—especially those in rural, coastal, peripheral, and Gaeltacht regions—at the heart of EU decision-making. Ireland has deep experience in balancing economic, social, cultural, and environmental priorities in rural regions, and this experience can help shift EU policy towards more equitable, resilient, and community-driven outcomes. 1. Embed Community-Led Local Development (CLLD) as a Core Mechanism Across EU Policies Ireland’s success with LEADER and place-based community development offers a model for the wider EU. By elevating CLLD within the Council’s agenda, the Presidency can demonstrate how empowering local partnerships leads to stronger economic resilience, better social inclusion outcomes, and more effective rural and regional development. To maximise impact, the Presidency could work to advance proposals that simplify multi-funded approaches, reduce administrative burden, and formalise local decision-making structures within future EU frameworks. This would ensure that EU programmes reach the communities they are designed to support, improving both efficiency and outcomes. 2. Promote Rural and Coastal Innovation and Equal Access to Opportunities Across the EU, rural and coastal areas face demographic decline, limited services, and infrastructure gaps. The Irish Presidency can drive progress by encouraging targeted investment in digital connectivity, local enterprise supports, transport solutions, and community infrastructure. Ireland can model how remote and coastal regions—like Connemara—can become hubs of innovation in the rural economy, blue economy, sustainable tourism, bio circular economy, nature-based solutions, and creative industries when supported appropriately. Championing these approaches at Council level can help ensure that businesses and communities in every region of Europe have opportunities to thrive. 3. Advance a Just, People-Centred Climate and Biodiversity Transition Communities across Europe are experiencing climate impacts, yet rural and coastal regions often bear the greatest pressures. Drawing on Ireland’s community and environmental experience, the Presidency can drive policies that enable local participation in climate action. This includes promoting community energy initiatives, supporting climate adaptation plans at local level, and ensuring that the Nature Restoration Law and other climate measures are implemented through partnership with communities rather than imposed on them. A just transition that supports livelihoods and empowers local action will strengthen social acceptance and long-term sustainability. 4. Strengthen Social Inclusion, Skills and Lifelong Learning FORUM Connemara’s work in supporting people distant from the labour market, providing training, and empowering marginalised groups positions Ireland to prioritise inclusive growth. The Presidency can champion Council outcomes that increase competitiveness, expand access to skills programmes, support social enterprises, enhance digital literacy, and invest in services for vulnerable groups. Such initiatives create long-term benefits for both people and businesses across the EU. The Irish Presidency can make its most substantial contribution by shaping an EU that listens to its communities, invests in its regions, and supports people to participate fully in economic, environmental, and social progress. With its experience in community-led development, rural innovation, and social inclusion, Ireland is well placed to lead the Council toward policies that deliver real, practical benefits for communities across Europe."

FORUM Connemara’s long-standing experience working with rural communities, coastal regions, Gaeltacht areas and people experiencing disadvantage demonstrates that engagement is most successful when it is local, accessible, and rooted in lived experience. 1. Bring the EU to Communities through Local Engagement and Storytelling Citizens understand Europe best when they see how EU funding and policies improve their own communities. Ireland should prioritise area-based communication that highlights tangible benefits: community centres built through EU programmes, LEADER initiatives supporting local enterprises, training funded under ESF+, and environmental projects enhancing local landscapes. FORUM Connemara’s model—working directly with communities on the ground—shows that stories from local people resonate far more than abstract explanations of EU structures. The Presidency could therefore promote more extensively the “EU in My Region” initiative, amplifying locally-led examples from rural, island, coastal, and Gaeltacht regions. 2. Use Community-Led Organisations as EU Bridges Community organisations like FORUM Connemara are trusted, embedded, and experienced in translating policy into practical outcomes. They are well placed to act as intermediaries between citizens and EU institutions. Ireland should involve local development companies as active partners in Presidency communications. This would not only broaden participation but also reinforce a sense of ownership among communities who see their work reflected in national and EU priorities. 3. Promote the EU as a Supporter of Rural, Coastal and Peripheral Regions Citizens in rural or geographically remote areas often feel distant from European institutions. Yet many EU values—solidarity, inclusion, sustainability, and cohesion—speak directly to their needs. Ireland can use its Presidency to showcase EU policies that support rural economies, fisheries communities, environmental restoration, broadband investment, and skills development. FORUM Connemara’s work exemplifies how EU programmes can sustain local jobs, enhance social inclusion, and support environmental stewardship. Highlighting these successes will strengthen public understanding of how EU membership benefits places sometimes overlooked. 4. Create Opportunities for Direct Citizen Participation in the Presidency Citizens develop a sense of ownership when they feel they are part of shaping decisions. Ireland should create accessible, community-based dialogue events, youth panels, and thematic workshops linked to the Presidency’s themes—especially in rural and Gaeltacht regions. FORUM Connemara would be happy to assist in the organisation of these events in the Connemara area. Digital platforms could complement this engagement, but in-person, locally facilitated forums are essential for reaching those less connected to national debates. 5. Communicate EU Values Through Practical Outcomes, Not Just Messages Core EU values—cooperation, equality, cultural diversity, environmental sustainability—should be communicated by showing their impact. FORUM Connemara’s work in inclusion, training, community-led development and environmental protection provides concrete examples of these values in action at local level. To build ownership and understanding, Ireland should focus on community-level engagement, trusted local messengers, and real-world examples of EU support. Through approaches grounded in experience and partnership, the 2026 Presidency can bring Europe closer to its citizens and ensure that they see themselves reflected in Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

Operating across multiple SACs in Connemara and South Mayo and funded through EU-linked mechanisms via Wild Atlantic Nature LIFE IP and National Parks and Wildlife Service Dúlra shows how community-based conservation can advance Ireland’s environmental obligations while strengthening rural livelihoods and local engagement. Community Engagement, Education and Knowledge Exchange A central strength of Dúlra is its emphasis on community involvement and awareness-building. The project works closely with local residents, landowners, schools and community groups to foster understanding and support for environmental restoration and EU biodiversity goals. Key engagement results include: Community events and workshops, including school programmes, local forums, site demonstrations, knowledge-exchange sessions and contributions to national conferences. Collaboration with a broad network of partners including NPWS, LAWPRO, Inland Fisheries Ireland, County Councils, academic institutions and local organisations. Clear communication of restoration benefits, including biodiversity protection, improved water quality, enhanced climate resilience and strengthened community stewardship of natural landscapes. This engagement-led approach has built strong local ownership, helping communities see first-hand how EU-supported actions lead to real improvements in their environment. Environmental Restoration and Invasive Species Control Dúlra has implemented one of the most extensive rhododendron control and habitat restoration programmes in the region. Major achievements include: Over 616 hectares of new rhododendron clearance in Connemara and South Mayo. More than 100 hectares of retreatment carried out to secure long-term ecological recovery. Restoration actions delivered in priority sites under the Habitats Directive. Peatland restoration on a local farm to raise water tables, improve habitat condition and support climate and biodiversity objectives. Development of Restoration Action Plans (RAPs) to guide ongoing peatland recovery and carbon sequestration efforts. Notably, FORUM Connemara has a peatland restoration site less than one mile from our head office in Clifden, providing an accessible demonstration location for visiting officials and policymakers to observe restoration work in practice. Community Employment, Training and Skills Development The project has created a strong community-led employment model that integrates rural jobs with environmental goals. Achievements include: A dedicated field team delivering high-quality restoration work across challenging upland terrain. Over 130 participants trained in 2025 through DAFM-supported programmes such as chainsaw skills, tractor safety, manual handling and Working at Heights. Ongoing professional development for supervisors, ecologists and GIS/mapping specialists. Strengthened partnerships with local landowners, commonage groups and community organisations. This model demonstrates how EU-supported restoration can stimulate rural employment, develop skills and build long-term local capacity. A Scalable and Replicable Model Dúlra provides a clear example of how locally delivered restoration, supported by EU mechanisms and strong partnerships, can achieve substantial ecological gains while building community involvement and trust. The approach is cost-effective, scalable and directly aligned with EU biodiversity, climate and rural development priorities."

The affordability crisis in Ireland and Europe is knitted into every aspect of our daily lives. Ordinary citizens cannot get sufficient mortgages, the estate agents list too few homes for sale, of course most don’t have the cash or borrowing capacity for a retrofit.

The Irish Presidency has the opportunity to lay a foundation for its successors by making prevention, screening and data-driven policymaking central themes. Without healthy societies, the EU cannot achieve its other aims of boosting competitiveness, resilience and democratic legitimacy. With the upcoming negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework, Ireland could champion a forward-looking EU budget that recognises health as a foundation of economic resilience, paving the way for achieving the aims of the strategic agenda by 2029. Prevention: Disease prevention is the most cost-effective way to strengthen resilience and preparedness, as called for in the EU Strategic Agenda. Many drivers of ill health stem from factors outside the healthcare system, including environmental exposure, working and living conditions, and socioeconomic inequalities, meaning disease prevention needs to be addressed holistically across policy areas. Actions should be taken in the areas of tobacco control (high risk factor for kidney and bladder cancer), gender neutral HPV vaccination, which will also result in lower incidence for penile cancer, and environmental carcinogens (eg, PFAS and other chemicals). The Irish Presidency should champion action on these root causes rather than downstream symptoms, helping to build long-term resilience and protect social and economic stability from future health shocks. This approach would strengthen population resilience, reduce long-term system costs, and support citizens’ wellbeing, participation and productivity. Cancer Screening: Equitable, quality-assured screening programs are essential to detect high-burden diseases earlier and improve survival rates. If developed and implemented properly, early detection programs not only save lives, but also reduces healthcare expenditure, contributing directly to Europe’s competitiveness. Screening initiatives also embody the Strategic Agenda’s call for fairness and inclusion, ensuring that all citizens benefit from advances in health policy regardless of geography or income. EU project screening pilots have provided a blueprint for organising more impactful and cost-effective screening (e.g. PRAISE-U, which includes a pilot in Ireland). Turning lessons learned into widespread implementation across the EU is now essential. The European Commission Initiative on Prostate Cancer is anticipated to be launched in early 2026 which will start work on guidelines and quality assurance. Big data: Harnessing health data and real-world evidence will transform EU health outcomes in the near future, as long as it’s considered a political priority. This requires coordination on collection, interoperability, and secure use of health data. Data-driven insights also support innovation in healthcare, digital health solutions, and AI-enabled decision-making, while providing a foundation for evidence-based policy that improves outcomes, strengthens health systems, and creates opportunities for research and responsible business development across Europe."

The incentives need to be tangible for citizens and healthcare professionals, public institutions and non-profit research organisations as well as for commercial users. The result will be a huge positive impact on health research, making use of data we have (only 3% is currently used) to change diagnostic and treatment guidelines by analysing real world data, where the need for randomized clinical trial is reduced, screening programs, and preventive measures for a healthier and more productive societies. Non- Communicable Diseases (NCDs): NCDs remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe, undermining resilience and competitiveness. The Irish Presidency should focus on broadening the EU’s NCD agenda beyond traditional priorities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, integrating stigmatised conditions that significantly affect quality of life, social participation, and productivity. We recommend, next to the Genito-urinary cancers, the addition of Continence Health into the NCD agenda - between 55 to 60 million Europeans suffer from Urinary Incontinence, and it currently poses a burden of almost €70 billion. Ireland has recently introduced an effective model to address the burden of continence health across Ireland through the introduction of community based continence health nurses. Sharing knowledge with other EU Member States on continence health will be highly valuable. Ireland can help reduce the societal and economic burden of NCDs, support healthier ageing, and strengthen overall resilience of health systems across Europe, through promoting prevention, early detection, and equitable access to care within Council conclusions and health promotion strategies. Gender-based research: The EAU calls for a greater understanding of the intersectionality between gender and health. We strongly encourage Ireland to work on initiatives to understand the influence of gender on social, economic, environmental, political and cultural determinants of health, influencing exposure to risk factors and interactions with health systems. Evidence based frameworks and strategies that work for men, women and LGBTQI+ communities rely on this approach, which requires specific and explicit actions and commitments. For example, research indicates that men experience a disproportionately higher impact from cancer compared to women, both in terms of how often it occurs and the likelihood of death. This disparity arises not only from biological differences but also from issues linked to cancer prevention. The Urinary Incontinence burden in women is four times higher than in men and that the prevalence of UI is generally experienced at a younger age in women than men, largely due to pregnancy and the postpartum period. It is for this reason that the EAU is endorsing the Irish based European Institute on Women’s Health and the strategic approach to women’s health across the EU. We also lead the European Cancer Organisation’s Inequalities Network, and work on men and cancer. Given that Ireland is one of the first European countries to have its own National Men’s Health Action Plan, it should use its leadership and expertise to encourage other Member States to doing the same."

By championing the adoption of emerging technology and demonstrating use cases, the EU can develop and capitalise on new opportunities for growth, driven by a dynamic culture of innovation and implementation. In advancing the EU’s competitiveness, the Presidency must focus on the advancement of the simplification agenda, and ensuring the benefits Ireland has realised, as a small, open economy, are mirrored on the European stage. It is essential that efforts to advance Europe’s competitiveness are underpinned by priorities including simplification, particularly with regard to the digital rule book, investment in skills and talent, an open approach to digital sovereignty that resists protectionism and support for innovation through balanced and proportionate regulation. Measures to prevent the unintended consequences of currently unregulated third-party litigation funding would be beneficial. Such measures would support competitiveness, providing safeguards and certainty for business, consumers and court systems, reinforcing the rule of law and enhancing the EU’s attractiveness for investment. Ireland should progress work to achieve advancement of an EU Single Market that enables businesses to grow at scale, fosters innovation and strengthens open markets, furthering the EU’s status as a premier global location to operate in. With changing EU population trends, and the growing demand for skills, underscored by the development of emerging technologies, Ireland, through the EU, can lead progress in life-long learning, a focus on a skills- based economy, and greater talent mobility. These measures can develop a talent pool that is flexible, mobile and has the capacity to harness the potential of disruptive technologies. During Ireland’s Presidency, substantial focus on AI and digital is expected and Ireland’s planned AI Summit in October 2026 represents a significant opportunity to showcase global leadership, and to shape the EU’s future view on AI. This provides a platform for Ireland to bring together cross-sectoral actors and take an allof-society approach to showcase the beneficial and transformative impact that AI adoption, utilisation and innovation can have in all facets of the Irish, and European, economies. It can serve as a means for Ireland to lead conversations on AI frameworks, sandboxes, and regulatory coordination in a manner which builds upon Ireland’s position as a digital regulatory hub within the EU. In supporting R&D, for instance, in life sciences, it is paramount that there is a strong emphasis on enhancing the EU’s capabilities, and scientific output, alongside the Union’s industrial foundations. Significant economic opportunity exists with policy decisions that improve the RD&I ecosystem, enhance the EU’s attractiveness as a location for leading clinical trials, and protect and support the EU as a home for IP. This can support citizens by ensuring the development of, and access to, innovative medicines and new technologies to support patient care and long-term health outcomes. The Draghi Report highlighted the need for a more strategic and innovation-driven Europe. Ireland can advocate for competitive state aid reform, strategic investment in future industries, a stronger Horizon successor programme, and a pro-innovation policy environment."
297,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a69f6e18/American_Chamber_of_Commerce_Ireland_-_Submission_297.docx,American Chamber of Commerce Ireland,,,,2,"Life sciences It is key that files including the Biotech Act and the Critical Medicines Act are focused on supporting innovation whilst addressing regulatory burdens and complexities. A desired outcome of key files is a simplified regulatory landscape for clinical trials to make the EU a more competitive location for research. The Presidency should work to provide regulatory clarity for business, and advance measures which facilitate better patient outcomes and economically benefit the EU. Potential changes to EU pharmaceutical legislation and global IP frameworks pose risks to competitiveness. It is critical that Ireland continues to use its voice at EU level to defend pharmaceutical IP, Regulatory Data Protection, and market exclusivity frameworks from being weakened. In supporting preventative healthcare, measures to address communications challenges around vaccine safety to support vaccine uptake, and investment in healthcare infrastructure and preventable health would be beneficial for European society and the wider EU economy. Digital Since publication of the Draghi Report, just 1 in 10 of the recommendations have been implemented. On digital matters, just 5 of the 47 recommendations have been delivered. Focus should be on the implementation of existing digital regulation to address compliance and administrative burdens, rather than pursuing new regulations. Regarding EU AI Act implementation, a pause in enforcement could be beneficial considering the complexity of provisions on general purpose AI models. Advancing investment in, and delivery of, vital digital infrastructure will also be key. Ireland should lead efforts in identifying technology domains where Europe can best grow AI industrial strength, in partnership with the global AI ecosystem, leveraging existing strengths in software and applications. The Digital Networks Act will represent a key legislative file for Europe’s digital future aiming to support connectivity and investment while providing regulatory certainty. Ireland and the EU should avoid overregulation and instead focus on demand-side, consumer-focused public policies to drive adoption of advanced connectivity. Adapting the telecoms framework for efficient spectrum allocation and prioritising the provision of pan-EU services that directly benefit consumers, will support a competitive telecoms market, AI ambitions, digital public services, and emerging digital technologies. Other important issues include recognition of the importance of digital advertising, finding the correct balance on copyright law between digital innovation and rights-holders, continuing efforts and engagement with stakeholders regarding reducing online fraud and scamming, and ensuring a balanced approach on the regulation of batteries. The Presidency should advance policy development on openness as a driver of competitiveness and innovation, including through open digital sovereignty as the basis for cloud and AI policy under the Cloud and AI Development Act, preserving access and partnership opportunities for European industry with global technology providers. Competitiveness Key in supporting the EU as a place to do business is protecting the tax sovereignty of Member States. Measures providing safeguards in relation to third-party litigation funding would be beneficial. By acting on oversight measures and transparency, the Presidency can support a responsible approach to third-party litigation funding regulation at EU level, for instance, through a Directive focused on minimum harmonisation. In relation to the food supply chain, a fair-trading environment must be promoted for all actors under the Unfair Trading Practices Directive. It will be important that coercive commercial practices are addressed. It should be evaluated as to whether more tools are needed to regulate territorial supply constraints, with consideration given to potential impacts on the FMCG sector. Implementing changes in public sector purchases technology represents an opportunity to modernise how the Public Procurement Act impacts on technological adoption. By working with European businesses and trusted global partners, to focus on ensuring the best value-for-money, rather than the best price, greater efficiencies can be driven in the public sector, resulting in greater, more effective digitalised services delivery. Cybersecurity The Presidency should consider measures regarding reviewing the Cybersecurity Act. The EU should employ a risk-based approach, providing for the highest standards in security, while allowing trusted partners continue to contribute to economic development. Avoiding protectionist measures will enhance the EU’s competitiveness for investment and innovation."
297,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/a69f6e18/American_Chamber_of_Commerce_Ireland_-_Submission_297.docx,American Chamber of Commerce Ireland,,,,3,"In line with the European Commission’s goals to ensure the regulatory regime is fit-for-purpose, to reduce the administrative burden and to simplify legislation, it is important that Ireland examines its own transposition of EU directives. Ireland should ensure that the transposition of obligations under EU directives is completed in a manner which is consistent with other Member States and does not lead to the introduction of additional requirements, increasing administrative and compliance costs or duplicating requirements for business. In supporting business, it would be beneficial to ensure that economic impact assessments are required for new legislative packages, with a view to ensuring investment and growth is not hindered or adversely impacted. Such an approach would support people in accessing new technologies and innovations that are available in other markets, whilst also enhancing the EU’s reputation as a location in which to innovate. Furthermore, such action would work to address the compliance burdens faced by businesses, which can be detrimental in terms of growth, given the resourcing requirements created by increased compliance and administration needs. Action to address fragmentation amongst Member States with regard to issues which impact legal certainty, cooperation across borders, and which could adversely impact the confidence of investors will be key to supporting businesses across the EU. As the Draghi Report recommended, pursuing approaches, for instance sectoral agreements, to support RD&I and the growth of key sectors within the EU would be beneficial. This would also be beneficial for Ireland given the significant presence of world-leading companies in sectors including life sciences, digital, advanced manufacturing, and financial services. Further, it is key that investment in talent and skills is to the fore in supporting people, businesses and communities across the EU. As we look to future business growth, AmCham members have identified their greatest skills gaps as being in the areas of digital and data, machine learning and AI, and engineering. Ensuring the development of these key skills, to support business growth into the future, will be essential in supporting the EU in attracting future waves of investment in new and innovative products, technologies and services. Addressing barriers to EU funding supports will also be integral in supporting business, and making sure the EU is best placed to grasp the opportunities of the future. For instance, with regard to the EU Horizon Funding framework, persistent barriers exist. This is particularly the case in terms of Cluster 3 (Civil Security for Society) and Cluster 4 (Digital, Security and Space). Such barriers include eligibility limits (Article 22.5 of the Horizon Europe regulation), guarantee mechanics, administrative overheads, unclear IP/public-private rules, awareness limits in industry, domestic process gaps at government agency level, and onerous and unnecessary application procedures. These factors hold back broader participation in the RD&I landscape by business, academia and research. Addressing these factors would further unlock the cascading benefits of thriving industry clusters and support what is already a highly skilled talent base."

Building on this consultation the development of clear strategies and a roadmap for growth, competitiveness and productivity can provide for a common goal in which citizens and businesses can share with Governments. Championing skills and talent, as well as life-long learning opportunities within the EU can further strengthen the EU’s opportunity offering at home and abroad. This will result in greater talent attraction and retention while also facilitating future investment in the EU. Actions that build further skills mobility and opportunity can demonstrate that the EU recognises the innovation, ingenuity and value that citizens bring to the economy. Balancing growth and competitiveness, while also providing for the highest standards in protection and safety, is key to building confidence through communication. It is therefore important that changes pursued under an ambitious simplification programme are clearly communicated to citizens and demonstrate the shared benefits of such measures."

For the European Association of E-Pharmacies (EAEP), Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU should focus on three interlinked high-level thematic priorities: a true Single Market for Digital Health and Medicines, the resilience and security of pharmaceutical supply chains, and a patient-centred, sustainable health policy framework. Digital health transformation will remain a core EU priority in 2026, with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) entering critical implementation phases, as well as the role out of the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW). Ireland is well positioned to champion the operationalisation of cross-border digital services, including e-prescriptions, telepharmacy, and secure health data exchange. For e-pharmacies, harmonised rules for digital identification, cross-border dispensing and e-prescriptions are essential to unlock innovation while protecting patients. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise practical guidelines for market implementation, interoperability standards and cybersecurity in health services. By doing so, the EU can move from fragmented national systems towards a truly integrated digital health market that improves access, affordability, and continuity of care for citizens across borders. Additionally, recent global crises have exposed Europe’s strong dependence on third countries. Ireland should make pharmaceutical security a cornerstone of its Presidency, advancing the implementation of the EU Pharmaceutical Strategy and the Critical Medicines Act. Finally, it is important to point out that Europe’s health systems face dual pressures: demographic ageing and fiscal constraints. Ireland should prioritise policies that reinforce primary care, prevention and digital access while maintaining cost efficiency. E-pharmacies already contribute to this goal by improving medicine adherence, facilitating chronic disease management and extending access in underserved areas. Ireland’s 2026 Presidency comes at a pivotal moment for Europe’s health and digital policy landscape. By focusing on digital integration, supply chain resilience, and patient-centred care, Ireland can deliver a strategic and future-proof Presidency. For the e-pharmacy sector, these priorities would not only strengthen the Single Market but also ensure that innovation directly translates into safer, more accessible and more resilient healthcare for all European citizens."
330,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/14a5da0d/European_Association_of_E-Pharmacies_-_Submission_330.docx,European Association of E-Pharmacies,Association,Healthcare professionals,EU wide,2,"For the EAEP, Ireland’s 2026 Presidency should concentrate on policy areas that can significantly improve healthcare access, reinforce the Single Market, enhance patient safety, and support innovation in digital health. The focus should be on advancing legislation, accelerating implementation, and harmonising rules. A central priority should be the implementation of the European Health Data Space. By 2026, the EHDS will be moving into practical roll-out, making Ireland’s role in driving interoperability, cybersecurity, eprescription and electronic health records uptake particularly important. For e-pharmacies, the EHDS is essential to enable secure (cross-border) patient authentication and continuity of care in and between Member States. Equally relevant is continued progress on the CMA and the broader reform of the Pharmaceutical Legislation. Cross-border healthcare should also be a core focus. While the legal framework already exists, citizens still face fragmented rules, administrative burdens, and low awareness of their rights. An update to the current cross-border healthcare directive should be part of the policy discussions under the Irish Presidency. A further strategic priority is the growing healthcare workforce shortage across Europe, particularly among pharmacists and primary care professionals. Ireland should promote digital and innovative solutions as part of a broader response to workforce sustainability, including telepharmacy, remote pharmaceutical services and the recognition of new professional competencies. Finally, the strengthening of the Single Market should be a core horizontal ambition of the Irish Presidency. Fragmented enforcement and uneven implementation of EU rules continue to undermine both citizen rights and business investment. Ireland should champion stronger Single Market governance, reduced regulatory divergence and faster resolution of cross-border barriers affecting online players."

Many EU initiatives are going to be on their way to being adopted or entering implementation phases, including the EHDS and the CMA. A key opportunity for Ireland’s Presidency is to ensure that these policies move from regulation to real world delivery. This means prioritising secondary legislation, implementation guidance and stakeholder alignment, enabling national administrations, healthcare providers, SMEs and digital businesses to apply EU rules with clarity and harmonisation. Furthermore, Europe’s economic resilience depends heavily on its small and medium-sized enterprises. The Irish Presidency can maximise positive impact by placing competitiveness, regulatory simplicity and innovation support at the heart of the Council’s work. This includes reducing administrative burden, improving access to finance, and enhancing digital infrastructure. Lastly, digital transformation must be inclusive to create real value. The Irish Presidency can ensure that vulnerable groups, rural communities, and ageing populations are not left behind by Europe’s digital and health transitions. Expanding access to digital public services, e-health tools and cross-border healthcare solutions strengthen social cohesion and territorial equality. E-pharmacies already play a key role in improving medicine access for remote and underserved populations and Council positions that support digital connectivity, health literacy, and interoperable e-prescription systems would directly enhance quality of life for millions of EU patients."

From the perspective of the EAEP, healthcare access, digital innovation and patient safety offer some of the most tangible points to connect EU action with citizens’ experience. The EU’s role in ensuring medicine safety, regulating pharmacies, fighting counterfeit medication and enabling cross-border healthcare must be communicated in simple and relatable terms. Citizens should understand that EU frameworks are what allows for their safe online pharmaceutical services, especially through the EU Common Logo. Ireland’s Presidency should actively showcase success stories in digital health, e-prescriptions, medicine traceability and pharmacy regulation as concrete examples of how EU cooperation directly protects citizens. Ireland’s Presidency of the Council is a unique opportunity to make these benefits visible and concrete. A dedicated public event, developed in partnership with Inish Pharmacy as an Irish member of the EAEP, would demonstrate in practice how EU frameworks protect patients and modernise healthcare. This event could bring together pharmacists, regulators and citizens to explore how EU cooperation enhances safety and access in e-pharmacy services. A stakeholder such as Inish Pharmacy’s involvement would illustrate how a local Irish pharmacy applies EU rules every day to guarantee medicine safety and trusted digital services for patients. A crucial element of communication is ensuring that citizens are fully aware of their rights and able to actively exercise them. One of the strongest examples is the right to cross-border healthcare, which allows EU citizens to access medical treatment, prescriptions and pharmacy services in other Member States. However, despite its potential, awareness of this right remains low among the general public. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise making EU health rights visible, understandable, and usable. This includes clearer communication on how citizens can benefit from cross-border prescriptions, reimbursements, and access to medicines while travelling abroad. At the same time, regulation must become more harmonised, transparent, and equitable. Fragmentation between national systems and channels creates confusion for patients and healthcare providers, limiting the practical use of rights that already exist."

We strongly recommend that the Government works to promote the rights of Traveller and Roma women across the EU through the Council’s legislative work programme in 2026. The Irish Presidency can progress the development and implementation of key equality strategies including the next EU Gender Equality Strategy, the next EU Anti-Racism Strategy, the next EU LGBTIQ Equality Strategy, updated Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Anti-Poverty Strategy and the Strengthening of the Child Guarantee, which are included in the European Commission’s work programme for 2026. The NTWF advocates for the interests and perspectives of Traveller women to be represented in these strategies, and ongoing engagement with national and local Traveller organisations will be key to achieving this objective. Furthermore, the Irish Presidency should champion the need for robust, disaggregated equality data collection across all Member States, including the collection of voluntary, self-identified ethnicity data. This harmonisation is essential to accurately measure the progress of the EU Roma Strategic Framework for Equality, Inclusion and Participation 2020-2030 and future Anti-Racism Strategies. Without reliable, comparable data, effective policy monitoring and targeted resource allocation to address systemic inequalities impacting Traveller and Roma women across the EU will remain impossible. We also call on the Government to agree the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal in relation to extending the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crime (COM (2021)777 final 9.12.2021). The EU Strategic Agenda aims to ‘strengthen social dialogue, uphold equal opportunities and reduce inequalities’. The Irish Presidency can demonstrate leadership in this area by promoting the rights of minority groups, particularly the Traveller and Roma communities, as part of its commitment to building a Social Europe. The Government can re-affirm its commitment to implementing the strategic objectives of the EU Roma Strategic Framework and encourage EU-wide action to address anti-Traveller racism and discrimination. The effective implementation of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy II 2024-2028 (NTRIS II) will be key to advancing this work and ensuring that it has a meaningful impact on policy outcomes in the Traveller community. Furthermore, it is important that key issues impacting Traveller women are raised in the work of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council configuration (EPSCO), particularly in policy areas including access to housing, education, healthcare and employment, which are discussed in further detail in Question 5."

To ensure meaningful and substantial impact, the Irish Presidency should establish a mechanism, such as a High-Level Dialogue on Traveller and Roma Inclusion, that guarantees the active participation of Traveller and Roma organisations, particularly women’s groups, in the Council's EPSCO and JHA discussions. This would ensure policies are grounded in lived experience. The Council should also seek to support the active participation of civil society organisations (CSOs) to the greatest extent possible in events, conferences and meetings held as part of the Irish Presidency.

In the context of Council policymaking, the NTWF advocates for increased awareness and commitment at an EU level to addressing the key issues impacting Traveller women, which include: Accommodation: Housing is likely to be a prominent theme during the Irish Presidency, and it is important that these discussions extend to the disproportionate level of housing deprivation and homelessness impacting Travellers. The Irish Government has faced criticism from international human rights bodies including the Council of Europe on the consistent under-delivery of Traveller accommodation programmes and the lack of progress in delivering new builds of Traveller specific accommodation including provision for nomadism. For Traveller women, the housing crisis is compounded by their overrepresentation as primary carers in homelessness, resulting in a disproportionate length of time spent in inadequate, unsafe, and culturally inappropriate emergency accommodation. Healthcare: The mortality rate for Traveller women is three times that of the rate for women in the general population, with Traveller women having a life span that is on average 11.5 years less than that of settled women. Traveller women are more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions and disabilities. EPSCO should work to progress access to affordable and culturally appropriate healthcare for ethnic minorities. Education: Traveller women and girls experience lower rates of school completion, which can be linked to systemic racism and discrimination in the education system, as 46 percent of Irish Travellers have reported experiencing discrimination at school. In 2022/2023, 74 percent of Traveller children and 64.7 percent of Roma children entered junior infant classes in primary school from the ECCE programme or other preschool setting, compared to 92.3 percent of the general population. Only 27 percent of young Travellers in Ireland have completed at least upper-secondary education, compared to 97 percent of the general Irish population. Furthermore, barriers to higher education remain with only 4.7 percent of Travellers completing third-level education. Employment: Census 2022 showed that only 18 percent of Traveller women were employed, compared to 51 percent of women in the total population. Racism and discrimination are significant barriers to accessing employment, with 84 percent of Travellers reporting experiencing discrimination when looking for work. 96 percent of Travellers in Ireland are at risk of poverty, compared to 12 percent of the general population. Addressing these barriers to accessing employment is in line with the EU Strategic Agenda which seeks to widen participation in the labour market and increase rates of youth employment. Political Representation: Advancing the participation of Traveller and Roma communities in political life is a key objective of the EU Roma Strategic Framework. Although Travellers have been elected to local councils in the past, there are currently no Traveller political representatives at a local level. This lack of representation is also reflected at national level, where Senator Eileen Flynn is currently the first and only Traveller woman to serve as a national representative."

IFUT recommends that Ireland prioritise three mutually reinforcing themes that reflect both national strengths and pressing EU-wide challenges. 1. Strengthening Europe’s Knowledge and Skills Ecosystem A thriving EU depends on robust education, research, and innovation systems. Ireland should focus on policies that reinforce higher education as a public good, ensuring sustainable investment in universities . Central to this priority must be a clear commitment to quality employment within higher education, recognising that excellence in teaching, learning, and research is inseparable from fair, secure, and properly resourced academic and professional roles. Ending the widespread precarious employment that undermines both staff well-being and institutional capacity should be championed as an EU objective. 2. Delivering a Socially Just and Inclusive Europe Ireland should position social justice at the core of its Presidency agenda by supporting EU initiatives that enhance workers’ rights, promote collective bargaining, and ensure decent working conditions across all sectors. Higher education—one of Europe’s foundational public sectors—should be used as a case study demonstrating the need for fair working conditions as a prerequisite for social inclusion and economic resilience. Policies addressing the cost of living, access to education, and barriers faced by marginalised communities should be foregrounded. 3. Building a Sustainable, Future-Ready Europe A future-oriented EU must prioritise climate action, digital transformation, and long-term economic resilience. Ireland can lead by promoting coordinated, evidence-based policy frameworks that harness the expertise produced within Europe’s higher education and research institutions. Ensuring that these policies are underpinned by structured engagement with sectoral stakeholders, including trade unions, academic staff, students, and civil society organisations, will be essential. By adopting these priorities, Ireland can articulate a Presidency programme that is forward-looking, socially conscious, and firmly rooted in Europe’s shared commitment to fairness, knowledge, and sustainable development. A Presidency that champions high-quality employment, combats precarious work—including in higher education—and places meaningful sectoral engagement at its centre will contribute to a stronger and more cohesive European Union."

This includes ensuring that EU-funded projects cannot rely on insecure or underpaid academic labour and that funding mechanisms reward institutions that uphold fair employment practices. Focus should be put on ensuring that agreements reached at Council level are applied in each of the membership countries without dilution and that there is a responsibility on the ministries that sign up to these agreements to ensure that the terms of the agreements are applied domestically. This can only be done where there is sectoral engagement involving trade unions."

Kraken believes Ireland should focus on three overarching themes that reflect the Union’s collective needs while offering a forward-looking vision for Europe’s economic and social future. A Competitive and Innovative Europe: The Presidency should advance measures that enhance the EU’s global position and strengthen the Single Market, modernise financial and digital infrastructure, and support capital markets reform under the Savings and Investments Union (SIU). Europe’s markets remain fragmented, and EU citizens invest too little in productive assets. Digital tools such as tokenisation can increase efficiency, transparency, and market access. Emphasising innovation as a practical driver of resilience will help build consensus across Member States. Building Trust and Resilience in the Digital Economy: With MiCA and other digital frameworks entering implementation, Ireland can promote coherent, predictable rollout and reinforce consumer protection and market stability for all European citizens. A trustworthy regulatory environment is essential for businesses and citizens to adopt new technologies confidently. Empowering People With Skills and Access: Aligned with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, the Presidency should prioritise digital skills, financial literacy, and workforce readiness. Citizens need the tools to understand and benefit from the digital transition, including new ways to participate in capital markets under the SIU. Together, these themes offer a balanced and future-oriented foundation for the Presidency. They support EU unity and competitiveness, promote trust and stability in digital markets, and ensure that citizens have the skills and confidence to participate fully in Europe’s economic future."

For citizens, digital and financial literacy is crucial. As new frameworks take effect, people must understand how to use services safely and effectively. Better literacy supports informed decisions, broader market participation, and stronger long-term financial resilience. Public-private cooperation can help deliver practical, accessible education. For businesses, predictability and regulatory coherence matter most. Consistent implementation reduces fragmentation and enables firms to operate and raise capital more efficiently. A modernised, digital Single Market aligns directly with SIU objectives. For communities, innovation should reinforce inclusion and regional development.

In the current term, however, policy attention has shifted predominantly toward enhancing competitiveness. In practice, this shift has resulted in the effective abandonment of the Farm to Fork Strategy and its replacement with the Vision for Agriculture, which does not build upon the previous strategic direction. Consequently, we have entered a period marked by a strong emphasis on the “simplification” of legislation, including in areas affecting environmental protection. Each year, Europe experiences record-breaking temperatures, with countries increasingly affected by extreme heatwaves. Europe is now the fastest-warming continent in the world. The agricultural sector is among the first to be impacted by this crisis, yet little has been done to transform EU agriculture in a manner that ensures its long-term sustainability and resilience in the face of climate change. At the same time, agricultural exceptionalism, which continues to exempt the sector from more environmentally sustainable practices, not only persists but intensifies under ongoing deregulation. We urge the Irish Presidency to recognize the urgent need to transform our food system, equipping it to withstand the inevitable challenges of the future, and to support measures that offer long-term solutions rather than short-term fixes that risk incurring greater costs and consequences over time."

Prior to this initiative, the ANIT Committee of the European Parliament - established to investigate alleged infringements in the implementation of EU legislation on animal transport - found that the Regulation fails to provide animals with effective, tangible protection. Insufficient enforcement continues to contribute to significant animal suffering, particularly during longdistance journeys both within the EU and beyond its borders. Despite the proposal having been published two years ago, negotiations in both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union are progressing at an unacceptably slow pace. This does not meet the expectations of EU citizens, who have consistently called for stronger protections for animals during transport. For this reason, it is essential that the AGRIFISH Council, under the Irish Presidency, completes the negotiations should the outgoing Cypriot Presidency be unable to finalize them. We emphasize the importance of grounding legislation in evidence-based recommendations rather than assumptions or inflated worst-case assessments that overlook the benefits of higher animal welfare. EU animal welfare legislation is now outdated, and we urge policymakers to align the revised transport rules with the latest scientific evidence, including the European Food Safety Authority’s 2022 opinions. While economic and social considerations must be considered, certain practices cause unavoidable, intensive suffering to animals. Their continued authorization is incompatible with Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and contrary to citizen expectations for strengthened live animal transport standards. The revised transport rules must also be enforceable and legally sound, recognizing the EU’s enforcement limitations. In practice, this means that the revised Transport Regulation should set a clear path for the transition from the export of live animals toward trade in meat, carcasses, and genetic material, which offers economic, ethical, and environmental benefits. Finally, we urge the Irish Presidency to ensure that the adopted legislation is future-proof, providing adequate protection for animals in light of climatic and social challenges over the next years or even decades. We invite you to consult our policy brief on this topic, which outlines key evidence-based priorities for this legislative file, available here."

Currently, the EU strategic direction tends to prioritize short-term objectives and often resists measures with long-term benefits due to their immediate costs, overlooking the potentially far greater costs of inaction. It is essential that policymaking is guided by the latest scientific evidence and grounded in the principles enshrined in the EU Treaties, including the precautionary principle. Only through responsible, forward-looking legislation can the EU ensure resilient, future-proof policies that serve citizens’ interests, safeguard the environment, and uphold the vision of a sustainable and prosperous Europe."

A wide array of surveys, petitions, European Citizens’ Initiatives (ECIs), and other tools of participatory democracy demonstrate consistent support among EU citizens for strong animal welfare legislation. For example: 91% of EU citizens agree that the welfare of farmed animals (e.g., pigs, cattle, poultry) should be protected in a way that ensures decent living conditions (Eurobarometer, 2023). For Ireland, this figure reaches 96% - the third highest support for strong animal welfare legislation after Luxembourg’s 98% and Sweden’s and Finland’s 97%; Nearly 1.4 million EU citizens signed the “End the Cage Age” ECI, and 89% of EU citizens believe that animals should not be kept in individual cages (Eurobarometer, 2023); 83% of citizens agree that travel time for the transport of live animals within or from the EU should be limited (Eurobarometer, 2023); 94% of respondents to the 2022 public consultation on the revision of animal welfare legislation support prohibiting the transport of vulnerable animals, such as pregnant and unweaned animals, as well as animal exports. In light of this overwhelming public support, the Irish Presidency should ensure that animal welfare remains a priority, reinforcing EU leadership in responsible, humane, and future-oriented food and farming policy."

First, the Presidency should drive progress on delivering on the soon to be published Industrial Accelerator Act (potentially in trilogues in the second half of 2026), the Public Procurement Act (Q2 2026), and the Circular Economy Act (Q3 2026). These files are essential for creating demand for low-carbon products, including cement, and establishing a market for recycled materials. The Irish Presidency should aim for ambitious non-price procurement criteria that accelerate EU cleantech manufacturing capacity. Ireland has led the way in introducing such criteria with its implementation of a clinker substitution mandate, requiring a 30% clinker substitution for all publicly procured concrete. Second, on housing and construction, the Presidency should build on the upcoming European Strategy for Housing Construction and the European Affordable Housing Plan (both expected to be published in December 2025), as follow-up (legislative) initiatives will be crucial to address Europe’s housing crisis. The Draft Council Conclusions of 20th November highlighted the need to foster innovation in sustainable construction, including by promoting low-carbon solutions and developing harmonised standards under the new Construction Product Regulation. These areas are opportunities for the Irish Presidency to advance affordable housing initiatives and drive sustainable and innovative construction practices which would inherently build lead markets for lowcarbon products and support scale-up of cleantech manufacturing in this sector. Finally, targeted revisions of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (Q4 2025, potentially in trilogues in the second half of 2026) and the EU Emissions Trading System (Q3 2026) will be essential to strengthening carbon price signals and incentivising industrial decarbonisation. A strong CBAM is also one of Europe’s strongest tools to drive global decarbonisation. The Irish Presidency should aim to stay the course on the current trajectory of both files, including full CBAM phase-in and the phase-out of EU ETS free allowances by 2034."

At a time of global uncertainty, prioritising equality and human rights would demonstrate a clear commitment to safeguarding fundamental freedoms, strengthening the rule of law and ensuring that the actions of the EU deliver meaningful benefits for all citizens. Central to this must be a stronger focus on tackling violence against women and girls, including sexual exploitation, both online and offline which continues to undermine the safety, equality and participation in public, political and economic life across the EU. Ireland should prioritise addressing online and technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) during the Presidency. This aligns with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024–2029 commitment to protect citizens’ rights, ensure a safe digital environment and uphold rule of law values. Using the Justice and Home Affairs and the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council formations, Ireland can progress a coordinated EU-wide response to image-based abuse, deepfakes, cyberstalking, online harassment, bullying and other forms of TFGBV that increasingly transcend borders and cannot be addressed effectively by Member States alone. Ireland’s Presidency also offers a key opportunity to lead renewed action on addressing human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, at a time when the current EU Anti-Trafficking Strategy is ending. Human trafficking for sexual exploitation remains one of the most severe and persistent forms of violence against women, driven by organised crime, a tolerance for the highly gendered and racialised purchase of ‘sexual services’, inadequate victim/survivor protection and cross-border cooperation. This Presidency could drive political momentum for a more ambitious successor strategy that places victim/survivor centred approaches, prevention and international cooperation at its core. The 2026 Commission work programme includes proposals to address digital safety and regulate emerging technologies. Ireland should ensure these initiatives are victim/survivor-centred and close gaps in legislation, including within the Digital Services Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act, neither of which currently regulate or prohibit the creation of non-consensual AI generated intimate images. Ireland should also advocate for the consistent and rapid removal of non-consensual intimate images as a minimum standard across the EU. A further priority could be advancing shared EU definitions for online abuse to strengthen comparability and cross-border cooperation. At present, differences in terminology make it difficult to measure prevalence, monitor trends or evaluate the impact of EU law and policy. Coupled with this, there is a need for more investment in research examining online sexual harm and the offline impacts including the publication and exchange of findings across Member States. This will support future legislative proposals under the Commission’s work programme and help ensure that new digital, AI and online platform regulations are informed by a gender-sensitive understanding of harm."

These issues are deeply connected as online platforms and digital tools are increasingly used to facilitate exploitation. Prioritising these areas align with the Commission’s 2026 work programme, particularly initiatives on digital safety, AI governance, platform accountability and the regulation of emerging technologies. The Presidency should prioritise legislative progress on online platform regulation and digital governance, ensuring strong protections against online and TFGBV. Ireland should aim to secure Council agreement on measures requiring technology companies to prevent and swiftly address online harms and provide clear, reporting mechanisms for users. Progress could be advanced through the JHA and the TTE Council formations, ensuring that digital policies and cybersecurity strategies explicitly reference gender-based violence, strengthen protections for victim/survivors and provide policing authorities with effective digital investigation tools. Ireland should also highlight the impact of increasingly violent and degrading pornography, including depictions of strangulation and choking, which shape harmful sexual behaviours and attitudes, particularly among young people, and the role it plays as a gateway to CSAM (child sexual abuse material). The Presidency could promote stronger regulatory measures prohibiting the creation, publication and distribution of violent pornography and require platforms to proactively detect and remove such content. The Presidency should seek Council conclusions that commit Member States to: Adopting shared definitions of cyber and TFBGV to ensure consistent implementation of EU law and accurate measurement of prevalence; Aligning data categories to improve comparability, allowing the EU to track trends more effectively and strengthen it evidence base; Investing in EU-level research on online harms and their offline impacts and ensure the findings are shared to inform legislative and policy development; Strengthening regulation of AI-generated materials, including CSAM and other non-consensual or fraudulent content, with criminalisation not dependent on the victim evidencing harm; and Recognising the role of pornography in the proliferation of VAW and TFGBV and reviewing necessary measures to prohibit violent content. Alongside online abuse, human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation requires urgent EU-wide action. Organised networks use digital platforms to recruit, advertise and control victims therefore, addressing online abuse and strengthening anti-trafficking measures must go hand-in-hand. Ireland should therefore prioritise: Disrupting criminal networks through enhanced financial investigations, including their use of AI-based tools; Reducing demand by addressing the role of sex buyers and online platforms that advertising ‘sexual services’ involving trafficking victims; Improving identification, protection and long-term support for victims/survivors; and Strengthening cross-border investigations and judicial cooperation across Member States. Ireland’s Presidency should seek to establish a roadmap for the successor to the current EU Anti-Trafficking Strategy, which would also see a strengthening of collaboration with Europol and national law enforcement bodies and support binding minimum standards for victim/survivor protections and access to justice. Together, these priorities would position Ireland in a leadership role, delivering tangible progress on digital safety, gender equality and protection from violence and exploitation."

The expansion of online platforms and AI-generated content has created new forms of harm that affect individuals, communities and businesses. Ireland is well placed to lead the Council’s work in ensuring that emerging EU legislation and digital policy frameworks provide effective, and protective responses. Firstly, progress on digital safety, including stronger measures to address cyber violence, deepfakes, cyberstalking and other forms of TFGBV, would strengthen citizens' trust in the digital single market, particularly for women and young people who experience these harms at disproportionately high rates. By progressing work on platform accountability, better digital investigative tools and systems that allow Member States to cooperate across borders; the Presidency can help create a safer online environment for people and businesses alike. Ireland could also draw on the work already carried out by the AI Advisory Council which specifically addressed the impact of AI on the economy, workforce and citizens and recommended measures such as the introduction of ‘a personality right’ and creating a specific offence for the creation of deepfakes without consent. Secondly, tackling human trafficking for sexual exploitation would have clear positive effects for people and communities across Europe. Human trafficking networks increasingly operate through online platforms, which means stronger EU-wide rules on prevention, detection and content removal would reduce exploitation and protect those most at risk. Strengthening cross-border investigations, improving victim/survivor identification and ensuring access to specialist support services would help more women and girls exit exploitation safely, rebuild their lives and participate fully in society. Thirdly, if all Member States use the same definitions for online abuse and collect data in the same way, the EU will have more accurate, comparable and reliable data. This is turn will help identify trends, understand what kinds of online abuses are increasing and decide where resources are most needed. It will also benefit businesses and online platforms, as consistent rules and definitions across the EU give clarity on what must be monitored, reported and removed, eliminating the need to navigate different requirements for each Member State. Strengthening research and supporting the publication of EU-wide studies on online harms would further guide future legislative work. By championing these priorities, Ireland’s Presidency can help shape a safer digital environment, strengthen equality across the Union and support communities through improved protection and more resilient systems. With a strong focus on addressing digital violence and human trafficking for sexual exploitation, Ireland can use its Presidency to galvanise EU-wide action at a critical policy juncture. This approach would affirm the EU’s commitment to advancing human dignity, safety, equality and democratic values in a tangible and impactful way for some of the most vulnerable women and girls in Europe."

Digital safety, gender equality, action against human trafficking for sexual exploitation and the protection of victim/survivors of violence. These are areas where the EU can deliver visible and meaningful improvements that EU citizens can clearly recognise. Digital safety is a growing concern for families, women and girls, businesses and communities across Europe. By prioritising stronger rules for online platforms and better protections and coordinated action on cyber violence, Ireland can demonstrate how the EU helps create a safer, fairer digital environment for everyone. Clear public communication can highlight the benefits of EU-wide standards in holding tech companies accountable, reducing harmful content online and supporting the safer use of AI and emerging technologies. Highlighting EU-funded research on online harms and how it informs safer digital environs can also help the public to see why coordinated EU action matters. Addressing human trafficking for sexual exploitation is also critical. Trafficking affects communities across rural and urban areas, often facilitated through online advertising and cross-border criminal networks. Ireland can use its Presidency to show how EU cooperation disrupts organised crime, improves victim/survivor identification and ensures access to protection and long-term support. Communicating how EU-level action can help to safeguard vulnerable women and girls can illustrate the human value of EU membership. Public engagement should be a key feature of Ireland’s Presidency. This could include providing accessible explanations of EU initiatives, partnering with civil society organisations and frontline services and sharing lived experiences that show how EU action improves people’s lives. Highlighting lived-experiences and real-world outcomes would help make the work to the Presidency feel relevant to people and communities. When people see how decisions result in greater safety, equality and justice it may deepen their understanding of the EU’s impact By focusing on these priorities, Ireland can show how the EU reflects public values, responds to real concerns and protects people’s rights, fostering a stronger sense of ownership and connection among all citizens."

While our frontline experience comes from working directly with victim/survivors at local level, the issues we outline require solutions at national and EU level.",5,"Ireland’s Presidency is an opportunity to showcase the important work we are doing nationally to address sexual violence and exploitation. It will allow Ireland to demonstrate on a European stage the strides we have made, particularly though outlawing the purchase of sex, to bring the goal of equality and fairness closer. This could be further amplified through Ireland’s convening of high-level Member State meetings in particular on technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) and human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in Europe, claiming millions of lives each year and imposing an economic and social burden of approximately €282 billion annually. Ireland now has an opportunity to lead on this issue by building on the Cypriot Council Presidency’s work and ensuring that the EU delivers on its commitment to improve cardiovascular health across all Member States through the ambitious proposals outlined in the Plan. Equally, gender equality in cardiovascular health must be a high-level thematic priority. CVD kills more women than every cancer combined, accounting for 37% of female deaths in Europe. Women experience higher mortality rates and worse outcomes following acute cardiovascular events, yet are less likely to receive timely diagnosis and evidence-based treatments. Women-specific risk factors, including pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal influences are often overlooked, and women remain underrepresented in clinical trials. Given the significant opportunities in this area and the level of awareness it warrants, the ESC believes that the Irish Presidency should prioritise ensuring that a gender dimension in cardiovascular health is featured as a high-level thematic priority during its term. Another critical priority is advancing stronger tobacco and nicotine control measures. Tobacco use, including novel products such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco, and nicotine pouches, constitutes a global health disaster, causing 7.7 million deaths annually worldwide, with over two million attributable to cardiovascular disease. No nicotine product is safe for the heart: “less harmful” does not mean safe. Alarmingly, e-cigarettes are not replacing smoking but creating a new generation of nicotine users, with up to 40% of European adolescents trying them and 75% of young adults who vape having never smoked before. This trend threatens to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control and will increase the long-term burden of chronic disease. Ireland has already demonstrated leadership in this area, calling for an overhaul of the Tobacco Products Directive to address loopholes in marketing, social media promotion, and youth-targeted advertising. The ESC strongly supports revising the Tobacco Taxation Directive to ensure equal taxation across all nicotine products, indexing duties to inflation, and implementing a unified excise structure based on nicotine content. Higher taxes, combined with plain packaging, flavour bans, and strict online sales restrictions, are proven measures to reduce consumption and protect young people. By prioritising cardiovascular health, comprehensive tobacco and nicotine control and gender equality during its Presidency, Ireland can deliver transformative change, saving lives, reducing health inequalities, and strengthening societal resilience. These actions will place the EU at the forefront of prevention and public health, ensuring that the ambitious goals of the European Cardiovascular Health Plan translate into measurable benefits for all citizens."

While continuing the work kick-stared by its predecessor, Cyprus, the Irish Presidency can play a key role by advancing ambitious initiatives and ensuring effective cooperation on the legislative files and initiatives outlined in the European Cardiovascular Health Plan and the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme. Incorporating gender equality in cardiovascular health The Irish Presidency can ensure cardiovascular health is recognised as a priority within the EU’s broader gender equality agenda, through the revamped Gender Equality Strategy and the forthcoming EU Cardiovascular Health Plan. This includes supporting tailored strategies for women, improving awareness, early detection, and research on female-specific risks, and promoting equitable access to care. Targeted data collection and inclusion of CVD in gender policies will help close gaps and advance health equity across the EU. Modernising tobacco and nicotine control Ireland has demonstrated leadership in tobacco regulation and is committed to advancing the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive and Tobacco Taxation Directive. For this reason, the Presidency should prioritise swift action, setting an example for Member States by tackling youth-targeted marketing of vapes and novel nicotine products, harmonising taxation, and strengthening advertising restrictions, especially on social media and online sales. Continuing the work around the Council Recommendation on health checks for cardiovascular diseases Building on the groundwork initially laid by Cyprus, Ireland should champion the adoption and implementation of an EU protocol on health checks for CVDs by the end of 2026. This will enable early detection and screening for high-risk conditions such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and inherited cardiomyopathies, helping to harmonise preventive care and reduce inequalities across Member States. Leveraging AI, data, and digital innovation: Ireland should promote the deployment of interoperable digital infrastructures and trustworthy AI solutions as part of the European Health Data Space. Enhanced data collection and cross-border collaboration will drive personalised prevention, early detection, and optimised treatment, reducing disparities and improving outcomes. Initiating discussions on the Revision of Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and proposal for a Biotech Act Timely access to innovative cardiovascular treatments and technologies is crucial. The Irish Presidency should support streamlined regulatory pathways for breakthrough devices and foster research and development in cardiovascular medicine, ensuring that all patients benefit from the latest advances. In pursuing these priorities, the Irish Presidency should strive to achieve measurable improvements in cardiovascular disease prevention, research, treatment, and care. By fostering cooperation on legislative files under the CVH Plan, Ireland can ensure coordinated progress and effective implementation. Maintaining momentum on tobacco and nicotine control, with a focus on youth protection, will help reduce risk factors. Advancing harmonised health checks and screening protocols will standardise early detection and preventive care. Promoting digital transformation and AI integration will enable more personalized and efficient care. Securing meaningful budget allocations for cardiovascular health in the next Multiannual Financial Framework will provide the resources needed for lasting impact across Europe."

A recent WHO report shows that every euro invested in CVD management delivers an eightfold return. This is not just a health statistic: it is also an economic imperative. CVD costs the EU economy €282 billion annually in healthcare expenses, lost productivity, and social care. Without decisive action, this burden will continue to grow, undermining competitiveness and threatening the sustainability of our healthcare systems. Given this visible and pressing challenge, the Council has a clear opportunity to act decisively, for example by embedding cardiovascular health priorities within the EU’s broader economic and competitiveness agenda and emphasising their value as a sound investment. Investing in cardiovascular health is one of the smartest choices Europe can make. It means fewer premature deaths, healthier workforces, and stronger communities. It also means reducing pressure on healthcare systems that are already stretched to their limits. By prioritising prevention, early detection, and better management of CVD, the Council can help EU countries save billions in avoidable costs while improving quality of life for millions of citizens. This is not only about health but also about Europe’s future prosperity. A healthier population drives productivity and innovation, while businesses benefit from reduced absenteeism and a more resilient workforce. Communities thrive when resources are freed from avoidable healthcare costs and reinvested in education, infrastructure, and social programs. In short, tackling CVD is a win-win for people and the economy. The Irish Presidency can lead by ensuring that cardiovascular health is recognised as a strategic investment, not a cost. This means supporting adequate funding for strategies like the European Cardiovascular Health Plan, calling for proper funding for the EU’s biggest killer under the new Multiannual Financial Framework, and encouraging innovation through data-driven solutions and AI. As Europe has the capacity to be a global leader in health technology, starting with its biggest health challenge will send a powerful signal that the EU is serious about both wellbeing and competitiveness. By championing cardiovascular health as a shared investment, the Irish Presidency can unite Member States around policies that deliver measurable benefits, meaning healthier citizens, stronger workforces, and sustainable healthcare systems. This leadership should help ensure Europe’s future prosperity and resilience in the face of a challenge that continues to be posed by CVDs across the Union."

A powerful way to do this is through real examples of EU cooperation delivering measurable benefits and showcasing best practices. For instance, the 2024 approval by EU health ministers and subsequent implementation of the Council Conclusions on improving cardiovascular health in the EU demonstrates how membership enables countries to work together on shared challenges, resulting in stronger health recommendations and better outcomes for citizens. Communicating these successes in clear, relatable terms, such as improved access to care and healthier communities, helps citizens see the EU as a driver of positive change. Ireland’s Presidency offers an opportunity to create a sense of ownership and pride by championing initiatives that matter to people’s everyday lives. Another striking example would be the upcoming European Cardiovascular Health Plan, to be published on 16 December 2025 and expected to set out a roadmap for improving cardiovascular health across Europe. Following’s Cyprus’ initial work, Ireland can lead its rollout and emphasise how EU-level action translates into national benefits, reinforcing the message that EU membership is not abstract but practical and impactful. Collaboration with trusted voices is also essential. The ESC and its network of national cardiac societies, including in this case the Irish Cardiac Society, play a fundamental role in communicating progress achieved at EU and national levels. By partnering with these actors, Ireland can amplify messages about how EU initiatives, such as the Health Cardiovascular Health Plan and Council Conclusions, strengthen cardiovascular health policies and improve citizens’ lives at national level. These partnerships make communication credible and relatable, bridging the gap between policy and people. Finally, the Irish Presidency may consider the deployment of accessible and engaging channels, such as social media storytelling, community events, and collaborations with health professionals and experts in the field. Linking these achievements to broader EU values, including solidarity, cooperation, and shared prosperity, reinforces the message that EU membership delivers concrete benefits and that Ireland’s Presidency is shaping policies that matter."

Our submission addresses how Ireland's Presidency can leverage EU influence to advance these shared objectives globally while maintaining principled commitment to human security in an increasingly fragmented world.",1,"Ireland's 2026 Presidency arrives at a pivotal moment when the international rules-based order is under unprecedented strain. The Commission's 2026 Work Programme, themed ""Europe's Independence Moment,"" rightly emphasizes sovereignty, security, and competitiveness. However, MAG urges Ireland to advance a complementary interpretation: true European independence means looking outward, not turning inward—working with partners globally, supporting those most in need, and demonstrating that sovereignty is strengthened, not diminished, by principled commitment to protecting civilians and upholding international norms. We propose that Ireland embrace ""Human Security in a Fragmented World"" as an overarching theme, positioning the Presidency as a thoughtful counterpoint to the prevailing drift toward abandoning global norms and commitments. Core Thematic Priorities: 1. Upholding International Humanitarian Law and Disarmament Frameworks This Presidency should champion the enduring relevance of IHL and existing disarmament treaties - the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, Convention on Cluster Munitions, Arms Trade Treaty, and Geneva Conventions - as essential infrastructure for human protection. These frameworks represent decades of consensus-building and must be reinforced, not sidelined, in an era of great power competition. 2. Human-Centred Security and Protection Traditional state-centric security models have manifestly failed to protect civilians in contemporary conflicts. Ireland should advance a human security paradigm that prioritises civilian protection, addresses the long-term humanitarian consequences of weapons use, and recognises that true security flows from meeting people's basic needs for safety, livelihood, and dignity. 3. Sustainable Peace Beyond Military Solutions Ireland's tradition of active neutrality - characterised by constructive engagement in conflict resolution - offers a valuable alternative to seeking peaceful resolution of disputes. The Presidency should emphasise conflict prevention, civilian crisis management, and the essential role of humanitarian mine action and reconstruction as precursors and enablers of sustainable peace. Sustainable peace requires addressing the weapons ecosystems that perpetuate insecurity: indiscriminate weapons use, poorly managed arsenals, weapons proliferation and diversion all extend armed violence beyond battlefields, while uncontrolled stockpiles pose risks long after ceasefires. Ireland should champion humanitarian mine action, arms control and weapons and ammunition management as peace infrastructure - practical measures preventing rearmament cycles and reducing weapons availability that sustain conflict and armed violence. The Irish Presidency offers a strategic opportunity to ensure adequate MFF funding for these commitments, as Ireland will steer crucial budget discussions determining the EU's capacity to deliver on civilian protection priorities. 4. Equitable Global Solidarity While Ukraine rightly commands attention, the Presidency must resist selective concern. Since 2022, Ukraine has received disproportionate mine action funding - $308 million in 2023 alone, representing 30% of global resources - while contexts like Gaza, Myanmar, South Sudan, and the Sahel face shrinking support. Persistent funding gaps undermine broader stability efforts, increasing pressures linked to forced displacement, insecurity, and weakened resilience - all factors shaping Europe's wider neighbourhood and migration patterns long-term. Ireland can model principled multilateralism by ensuring EU external action serves all conflict-affected populations, including reinvigorating the EU-Africa partnership when other major powers are disengaging, demonstrating Europe remains a reliable partner addressing root causes of instability and displacement."

Precisely because Europe experiences war, it must voice the priorities and concerns of all communities in conflict, demonstrating that Europe's own challenges heighten rather than diminish its commitment to those caught in conflicts worldwide. Our recommendations focus on the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) and General Affairs Council (GAC): External Relations and Development Cooperation Advocate for sustained, predictable funding for humanitarian mine action as essential infrastructure for humanitarian assistance, post-conflict reconstruction and development Champion integration of explosive weapons in populated areas (EWIPA) commitments into EU external action, ensuring IHL compliance is systematically assessed with Gaza demonstrating the devastating consequences when these protections fail Ensure EU development and reconstruction funding in conflict-affected contexts includes mandatory explosive hazard assessments and clearance capacity Strengthen conflict sensitivity mainstreaming across EU external action, ensuring robust implementation in fragile contexts where research has identified significant policy-practice gaps While the Commission's 2026 Work Programme emphasizes ""Readiness 2030"" for defence capabilities, Ireland should ensure the FAC balances military readiness with civilian protection infrastructure. Ireland should push for review of EU HMA Guidelines and ensure the post-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework explicitly recognises mine action as cross-cutting priority within external action - foundational to achieving SDGs in conflict-affected states, not merely security concern. B. Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) Resist narrowing security policy to hardware and military capability, ensuring adequate resources for civilian protection, peacebuilding, and humanitarian assistance Ensure increased military assistance to partner nations is accompanied by robust weapons and ammunition management capacity, including diversion prevention, stockpile management, and unplanned explosion mitigation, embedding responsible through-life management as prerequisite for security cooperation Lead renewed commitment to existing disarmament frameworks, demonstrating adherence to international standards remains possible and strategically advantageous amid great power competition The Commission's 2026 Work Programme centres on building ""strong and secure Europe"" through Readiness 2030. Ireland's Presidency must demonstrate effective security policy protects civilians from conflict-related harm, including long-term explosive threat effects from state or non-state armed groups. With over 150 non-state armed groups operating worldwide, security approaches must address the full spectrum of civilian threats. By championing disarmament norms when others abandon them, the EU can assert moral leadership and strengthen the rules-based order serving European security interests. C. Neighbourhood and Enlargement Policy Ensure EU support for Ukraine's reconstruction includes comprehensive, long-term mine action programming with sustainable national capacity development, drawing on global expertise and lessons from diverse contexts Support mine action capacity development across neighbourhood regions - Middle East, Western Balkans, Eastern Europe - recognizing each requires tailored approaches informed by sector knowledge Integrate conflict preparedness and explosive threat management into EU civil protection mechanisms for mutual member state support addressing legacy contamination or emerging threats Ireland's Presidency should support integration of mine action and weapons management capacity as criteria for neighbourhood stabilization and accession readiness."

We urge Ireland to resist this drift. The disarmament architecture built over decades - the treaties banning landmines, cluster munitions, regulating conventional weapons - is not outdated. It is more essential than ever. Russia's extensive use of landmines in Ukraine, Myanmar's deployment of antipersonnel mines around civilian infrastructure, and the proliferation of explosive weapons in populated areas across multiple conflicts demonstrate precisely why these norms matter. A Different Approach is Possible Previous Presidencies have understandably focused on economic recovery, internal cohesion, or immediate crisis response. Ireland in 2026 can offer something different: moral clarity about the kind of international order worth defending, and the practical expertise to operationalise that vision. This means: Ensuring that rising EU defence budgets do not eclipse humanitarian and development assistance Recognising that the long-term consequences of weapons use - contaminated land, destroyed livelihoods, traumatised populations - demand the same strategic attention as immediate military threats Understanding that sustainable capacity development in conflict-affected states, including mine action institutions and weapons management systems, is itself a form of conflict prevention Ireland's Unique Authority Ireland brings unmatched credibility to this agenda. No other EU member state can claim 67 unbroken years of UN peacekeeping. No other has maintained principled neutrality while remaining deeply engaged in conflict resolution. No other holds such authentic standing with both Western partners and Global South nations navigating between power blocs. This authority should not be squandered on safe consensus positions. Ireland's 2026 Presidency can demonstrate that peace is still achievable, that international law still matters, and that human security - not state power - is the foundation of genuine stability."

We have a strong presence in all towns and rural areas through a network of funded youth projects and approximately 300 local youth clubs the latter often being in very rural areas,1,"We believe Ireland should draw extensively on the first priority of the European Council’s Strategic Agenda 2024-2029 “a free and democratic Europe” for its overall priority/slogan. With so much going on in Europe and the world we need to ground Europe in high level principles such as human rights, the rule of law and EU values, most particularly; “We will protect and promote our founding values – respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities – which remain the cornerstone of our Union” This field is most relevant to our work where we focus on the rights of young people and their need to access quality local youth work and supports in their community. It also covers other strategic issues on competitiveness, climate, security and more. Few of the EU’s objectives can be realized if these overarching rights based values are let slide. Effectively a slogan/theme like “Furthering our Values and Rights” sums this up well. There is more room for diversity in three potential policy themes. We believe one of these must be rooted in the need to ensure the continuance of social Europe consistent with he European Pillar of Social Rights. There is considerable pressure at the EU and national level to reduce these protections and they figure less and less in EU processes. Yet for young people these are key to their development, whether it be in accessing local voluntary services, the housing crisis, mental health, and other areas. Tangible progress associated with the European project in these areas does more than all the treaties or declarations in the EU. Similarly the European Green Deal is constantly subject to dilution as witnessed at COP 30. A theme revolving around social, environmental and human progress then would serve the Irish Presidency well where relevant files and policy areas could be monitored and progressed by the Council to serve such a heading."

We have a strong presence in all towns and rural areas through a network of funded youth projects and approximately 300 local youth clubs the latter often being in very rural areas,2,"Below are key areas relevant to young people for Irelands Presidency largely in the EYCS and EPSCO configurations which would be relevant under a social and environmental theme. Consistent with the EU Youth strategy, “Engaging, Connecting and Empowering young people: a new EU Youth Strategy 2019-2027” youth is seen as a cross-cutting issue as witnessed by the overall youth dialogue and the individual Commissioners Youth Policy Dialogues. This is similar to youth policy at a national level. The following are the key policy and legislative areas in the above configurations and related fields; EU Youth Strategy This strategy will cease at the end of 2026. The strategy has pioneered the cross sectoral approach to youth. We believe there should be a rights based approach to youth work providing for access to youth work as a social right in policy and legislation. However, more emphasis may be needed on national delivery and levelling up local provision by member states. National programmes should facilitate and encourage mobility and other activities supported by the ERASMUS+. There should be a culture of parity of esteem between the formal and informal education systems. Another key issue is strengthening and supporting quality Youth Information particularly in a time of disinformation and fake news. This is also a cross cutting field. Our work with the European platform ERYICA, which we plan to showcase during the Presidency, has much to offer here. We are working locally and at the European level with partners and the Council of Europe (Strasbourg) on prioritising quality youth spaces for young people. Such practical initiatives should certainly feature in the EU Youth Strategy. ERASMUS and the MFF There will be a role for the trio and Presidency in supporting a strong budget allocation for ERASMUS+ particularly for the youth (as distinct from 3rd level) aspects. This is the part of the programme that achieves most in terms of inclusion and needs “earmarking” as called for by the European Economic and Social Committee. The Intergenerational Solidarity Strategy is due in 2026, it should not represent any dilution to support for youth or major youth issues such as youth work, education, housing, and mental health. Commissioner Micallef’s Mission letter from President Von der Lyen stated “We must ensure that decisions taken today do no harm to future generations” Other Cross Cutting Issues There are huge issues relating to mental health, online safety and the protection and delivery of the Digital Services Act. The Cyber Bulling Strategy is due early in 2026. The European Parliament and Maria Walsh MEP have done valuable work on an EU strategy for Mental Health. The development of EU policy relating to housing will remain a focus in late 2026 and affordability, particularly in the rental market, is critical for young people In employment and social affairs youth interests must be a focus on initiatives such as; EU Anti-Poverty Strategy Quality Jobs Act Fair Labour Mobility package Education Package Employment Guidelines 2026 & 2027 Traineeship Directive Equal treatment Directive"

We have a strong presence in all towns and rural areas through a network of funded youth projects and approximately 300 local youth clubs the latter often being in very rural areas,3,"It is inevitably challenging to bring somewhat arcane legislative and other procedures to the public at any time. There is however enhanced media and communications opportunities to enable at least increased impact. The events programme has the ability to link with local communities and civil society organisations to illustrate the actual work and how it impacts on everyday life. Certain files or policy areas may be more amenable to this. Local radio and local connections and visits can also help a lot. While the Commission and Parliament have advanced dedicated youth participation programmes these are less common with the Council meetings, particular outside of Education, Youth, Sport and Culture. The Presidency could be an opportunity to showcase quality youth participation in the policy making process in Ireland aligned to particular meetings and events. Similarly local events could also connect with local youth services in this fashion or through visits or fact finding activities. All these activities could also showcase the diversity of Ireland and connect all groups to the EU integration process. While respecting sensitivities the Presidency should be open to engagement with groups from Northern Ireland in some of its meetings and activities in venues in the south. This would maintain a connection with the EU and Northern Ireland and also possibly be appropriate to the re-entry or alignment of the UK with the ERASMUS+ Programme By promoting mobility and non-formal learning, the Presidency can help expand opportunities for skills development, cross-cultural exchange and innovation. These benefits extend beyond individual young people to employers, regional development and the wider EU economy. A Presidency that centres young people’s rights and strengthens the youth work sector will make a deep and lasting contribution to social and economic wellbeing across the Union."

We have a strong presence in all towns and rural areas through a network of funded youth projects and approximately 300 local youth clubs the latter often being in very rural areas,4,"In many respects this is linked with the previous question. There will be media and PR opportunities clearly. Some of these should perhaps take more the form of debate and discussion about the EU and it’s priorities rather than mere “flags and balloons” events. With young people, youth services and schools there may be many possibilities here and these should be linked to actual Council meetings or activities. While not and EU event the EPC meeting in Ireland should also feature in such activity. Key sectoral partnerships related to the Council configurations could also help with local debate and discussion events related to some of the more engaging policy issues and files. There are clearly a number of sectors and even interest groups with different views on numerous topics. The work previously carried out by citizens assemblies may also be instructive here Once more local events and activities are very much in the Irish culture and these can also find national expression for major set piece events. Local “adoption” of events or issues akin to the Special Olympics is an approach that seems to work well. We are confident that local youth services and young people would be more than happy to contribute or be involved in such activities A dedicated Youth approach to the Presidency would be a new departure and a huge benefit, it could include; Youth-friendly, factual communication delivered through reliable youth information services and youth workers as the trusted intermediaries who can translate complex EU policy into accessible, relevant content. This is essential to counter disinformation and strengthen democratic engagement. Creating participatory mechanisms for young people to directly shape Presidency-related discussions, such as youth dialogues, micro-grants for youth-led civic projects, and youth participation in thematic events. Highlight stories from across Ireland and the EU where EU membership has tangibly improved young people’s lives, from access to mobility, education, employment supports, digital rights, environmental protections and anti-discrimination frameworks. Use high-quality youth spaces such as arts centres, youth clubs, libraries, community hubs etc.. as local sites for Presidency engagement. These spaces are democratic infrastructures where inclusive and meaningful dialogue with young people can happen. Collaborate with youth organisations to design communication that is culturally and linguistically inclusive, accessible to all and tailored for diverse communities."

362,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/17aac35d/Limerick_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_362.docx,,,,,1,"For its 2026 EU Presidency, Ireland should prioritise sustainable energy, rural resilience, and community-centred governance. In particular, the rapid scaling of biomethane under REPowerEU highlights the urgent need for independent impact assessments, strict environmental safeguards, and oversight of public subsidies to prevent unsustainable industrial-scale biogas projects. Ireland can lead by embedding legally binding rules on feedstock use, digestate management, and spatial planning, ensuring local communities have a real voice in decision-making rather than bearing disproportionate social and environmental costs. By championing a model that balances climate, biodiversity, and rural development goals, Ireland can set a European benchmark for fair, sustainable energy transitions. Prioritising transparency, equitable benefit-sharing, and preventative regulation will help avoid repeating mistakes seen elsewhere in Europe, reinforcing trust in decarbonisation policies. These thematic priorities will position Ireland as a leader in creating energy strategies that are both ambitious and socially responsible."
362,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/17aac35d/Limerick_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_362.docx,,,,,2,"The European Commission’s REPowerEU action plan has set biomethane production on a course of massive upscale as part of efforts to increase EU energy independence, fixing a target of 35 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2030 – up from 4,1 bcm in 2023. However, until this day, no Impact Assessment was carried out on the target. As biomethane production continues to grow rapidly both in Ireland and Europe (with a currently 21% year-over-year growth), so do concerns about its associated environmental and social risks as well as the irresponsible use of taxpayers money. While biogas production from sludge or collecting the gas that is produced in landfills is appropriate, there are particular concerns about the effects of large-scale biogas production on the use of limited agricultural land, the continuation of polluting industrial animal production, harm to local communities, and the effects of methane leaking from biogas facilities. Further concerns arise when looking closer at promoted use cases for biomethane such as heating or transport which are often inefficient, expensive, and lock Europe into existing fossil infrastructure. The Irish Presidency should therefore prioritize conducting an independent, interdisciplinary impact assessment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of this target, ensuring it aligns with climate, biodiversity, and rural community goals. Emphasis must be placed on implementing strict economic, environmental, and social safeguards for biogas and biomethane production. With reference to the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme as well as the wider EU Strategic Agenda that highlights the need to secure Europe’s energy independence, we therefore encourage the Irish Presidency to: Advocate for an independent impact assessment of the EU’s 35 bcm biomethane target, as a prerequisite to develop further any expansion of biomethane production as part of relevant policy files in 2026, such as the Circular Economy Act, Bioeconomy Strategy, Livestock Strategy, Energy Union Governance Upgrade, and Common Agricultural Policy. This includes prioritizing truly sustainable feedstocks, efficient use cases, and avoiding lock-ins of fossil infrastructure. Include the voices of local communities in the debate. In order to expand biomethane production rapidly, the 2025 REPowerEU roadmap foresees a “tripartite contract to better address the diverging needs in different areas of the EU and include national and local stakeholders”. However, a focus has been set on facilitating dialogue between the EU Commission, EU Member States’ governments as well as industrial stakeholders; and no commitment has been made to give a role to local communities themselves that are affected by such projects. In line with its “people-centred” approach, the Presidency should therefore intensify its efforts to give the Irish people and local communities across Europe a greater say in the development of fair and sustainable biomethane strategies. Scrutinise public subsidy schemes for unsustainable biomethane production. This is critical to prevent perverse incentives that undermine the EU’s climate, food security, and energy independence goals. Current subsidies often favour industrial-scale biogas projects reliant on unsustainable feedstocks - such as manure from factory farming or energy crops competing with food production - which lock in polluting practices as well as animal welfare violations, and divert resources from truly circular solutions. Without strict oversight, these subsidies risk distorting markets, inflating demand for unsustainable livestock farming, and sidelining local, community-led projects that deliver genuine environmental and social benefits."
362,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/17aac35d/Limerick_Biogas_Concern_Group_-_Submission_362.docx,,,,,3,"Ireland’s presidency provides a unique opportunity to develop and promote a gold standard indigenous biogas industry that is sized and scaled to meet community needs. Learning from EU countries with an established biogas industry, Ireland can avoid the pitfalls of social acceptance that are consistently documented as barriers to bioenergy projects across the EU (Mancini & Raggi, 2022). Current regulatory gaps and weak planning assessments underestimate the cumulative impacts on rural infrastructure. Public health and safety questions about hazardous gas storage, particular emissions and emergency service access are heightened when regulatory oversight is perceived as reactive rather than preventative. Research has highlighted that digestate management and changes in feedstock mixes are critical risk vectors that demand much stronger regulation than is currently applied (Piadeh et. al, 2024). Ireland, through its presidency, can set the standard by developing industry-specific planning regulations that include community engagement at its core. The National Biomethane Strategy points directly to a highly industrialised model aimed at rapid development across rural Ireland. Within this model, revenue accrues to outside multi-national agri-investors while costs are borne by host communities in terms of road damage, odour, environmental degradation, and reduced property values. Communities demand transparent environmental impact assessments, accessible monitoring data and enforceable operating limits. The development of industry-specific planning regulations aligned with benefit-sharing mechanisms has the potential to provide a blueprint for use across the EU, while maintaining community engagement and the highest environmental standards. Meaningful community engagement, spatial planning that respects local carrying capacity, strict feedstock limits, alongside legally binding digestate management plans, are safeguards that would increase local acceptance. Rapid roll-out risks polarising rural communities, undermining trust in decarbonisation policy, and producing environmental and social harms that outweigh local benefits. Ireland has an opportunity through its EU presidency to either lead and develop new industry standards or to repeat mistakes already impacting the rural communities and the environment across Europe."
441,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/804ab5a4/Vanguard_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_441.docx,Vanguard Ireland Limited,,,,1,"Ireland’s Presidency should prepare the EU to address its major strategic challenges. The 2026 Commission Work Programme highlights the need for Europe to strengthen its competitiveness, reinforce its security and defence capacity, and accelerate the green and digital transitions. These ambitions require substantial and sustained private investment. Demographic pressures are also reshaping Europe’s social and economic landscape, increasing the importance of effective long-term savings systems that can support citizens and sustain Europe’s social model. Vanguard proposes three high-level themes on financial services for the Irish Presidency of the EU: Harnessing long-term investment by European citizens. The first pillar of the Savings and Investment Union strategy focuses on citizens and is critical to funding Europe’s economic transition. The introduction of Savings and Investment Accounts (SIAs) internationally has demonstrated how well-calibrated tax incentives, combined with simple and accessible account structures, can support citizens as they move from saving to investing. Consistent with our mission to take a stand for all investors, Vanguard supports policy reforms that enhance the position of retail investors. The Retail Investment Strategy has left significant unfinished business and the Irish Government has an opportunity to evolve the discussion on key success factors for EU retail markets. Potential topics include the investor journey, cost transparency and expanding the spectrum of advice options, building on excellent technical work by the Irish authorities in implementing the Funds Sector 2030 action plan. Promoting retirement security. As highlighted by the Draghi and Letta reports, shrinking workforces and rising dependency ratios are placing growing strain on public finances and pension systems in many Member States. The Presidency could advance the SIU agenda by emphasising the role of funded and supplementary pensions in ensuring sustainable retirement incomes and supporting long-term financial and economic resilience. Council discussions on the subject of retirement systems should both advance the Commission’s pensions package and spotlight positive reforms to retirement systems across the EU27. Efficient and integrated capital markets. Deeper capital markets can help mobilise private investment to support critical investments in sectors such as technology, infrastructure, clean energy and defence capabilities, while offering new financing opportunities for businesses, startups and scaleups. A stronger culture of saving and investing among households can improve financial wellbeing and support a more resilient European economy. In this context, the Savings and Investment Union (SIU) provides an important set of levers to help advance many of the EU’s wider policy goals."
441,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/804ab5a4/Vanguard_Ireland_Limited_-_Submission_441.docx,Vanguard Ireland Limited,,,,2,"As a major hub for international financial services, Ireland is well placed to guide the Council’s work on developing deeper and more efficient EU capital markets during its Presidency. The SIU sets out a broad agenda to widen retail participation, support long-term saving, and reduce the structural barriers that limit the flow of private capital across the Union. The Irish Presidency can play an important role in encouraging coordinated progress among Member States and ensuring that work across these files contributes to a more competitive and investment-ready European economy. Vanguard proposes three policy and legislative priorities on financial services for Ireland’s EU Presidency: Integrating EU capital markets: Fragmented capital markets limit the ability of firms to operate across borders. The Council’s work on files such as the Market Integration and Supervision Package (MISP) offers an opportunity for the Irish Presidency to demonstrate leadership in advancing the EU’s capital markets agenda. The success of the package should be measured against its ability to remove barriers, enhance efficiency, and expand market participation. Working with the incoming Cypriot Presidency, we would encourage the Irish Presidency team to front-load negotiation on aspects of the MISP which have most direct investor and market impact; notably the proposals to remove barriers to cross-border fund distribution and enhance the interoperability of post-trade market infrastructure. Savings and investment accounts (SIAs): The introduction of SIAs internationally has demonstrated how well-calibrated tax incentives, combined with simple and accessible account structures, can support citizens as they move from saving to investing. The Commission’s blueprint sets out a positive and pragmatic reform agenda for the Member States. The Irish Presidency should maintain the political momentum on this topic and highlight the significant contribution that SIAs can also make to retirement savings. Retirement savings for citizens: As Europe’s demographic shift accelerates, growing pressure on public pension systems makes it vital to strengthen the availability, accessibility, and attractiveness of retirement savings and funded pensions. The Commission’s blueprint on Supplementary Income Arrangements (SIAs) and its Communication on auto-enrolment offer natural entry points for the Irish Presidency to show leadership by fostering dialogue among Member States, sharing best practices, and helping to elevate these initiatives to the EU level. In parallel, the Commission’s forthcoming package on supplementary pensions, including the IORP II and PEPP revisions, will remain an important focus. These reforms aim to build stronger, more efficient private pension markets across Europe."

307,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/794e57f0/Federation_of_Irish_Sport__-_Submission_307.docx,Federation of Irish Sport,NGO,Sport and Physical Activity,National focus,5,". 1. Integrity, Safety and Values in Sport Ireland has an opportunity to champion a Europe where sport is safe, fair, and built on genuine respect. This priority isn’t just about rules—it’s about protecting the people who make sport what it is. We can focus on stronger governance in sporting organisations, better cooperation on anti-doping, and practical safeguards for athletes, especially children, vulnerable adults, and anyone who speaks up when something is wrong. Tackling discrimination, racism, online abuse, and all forms of violence in sport must also remain front and centre. Why Ireland? Ireland has made real progress in recent years on governance reform and safeguarding. That experience gives us credibility—and the confidence to help raise standards across Europe. 2. Healthy Communities and Increased Physical Activity (HEPA) Across Europe, people want healthier, more active lives. Ireland can lead a renewed push to make everyday physical activity part of normal life at every age—from school right through to older adulthood. This includes supporting active travel, more liveable and movement-friendly towns and cities, and tackling inequalities that stop some people from taking part—whether due to disability, income, or where they live. Local initiatives across Europe could be scaled more easily with shared EU funding and knowledge. Why Ireland? Ireland already has strong national strategies focused on health and physical activity, and we have experience working across departments. That practical approach is something we can share at EU level. 3. Sport and Sustainability: Driving Europe’s Green Transition Sport has an important role to play in Europe’s climate ambitions. This priority places sport firmly within the green agenda—from how facilities are built and upgraded to how events are run and how communities adapt to climate change. Areas of focus could include more sustainable infrastructure, shared guidelines for hosting environmentally responsible events, and better planning for the climate risks facing outdoor recreation. There is also huge potential in using sport to promote environmental awareness among young people and volunteers. Why Ireland? Ireland’s sports sector, especially through initiatives like the GAA’s Green Clubs Programme, is already taking meaningful steps on sustainability. That experience gives us a strong foundation to lead a conversation on “green sport” across the EU. 4. Sport as a Driver of Inclusion, Equality and Community Cohesion Sport has a unique ability to bring people together. As Europe continues to change and diversify, sport can be a powerful tool for connecting communities and supporting people who might otherwise feel excluded. Ireland could highlight the role of sport in integrating migrants and minority communities, advancing gender equality, and ensuring that people with disabilities can participate fully through better design and adapted sport. Supporting local clubs and volunteers is key, because that’s where inclusion really happens. Why Ireland? Ireland’s strong equality frameworks—and the deeply rooted community model of sport delivered through Local Sports Partnerships and national organisations—offer valuable lessons for other Member States. 5. Innovation, Digital Transformation and Skills in Sport Sport is changing quickly, driven by technology and data. Ireland can play a central role in shaping this future. Digital tools can help people become more active, and AI can offer new ways of analysing performance or improving governance—provided it’s used safely and ethically. There is also real potential to support sport-tech start-ups and modernise the skills of coaches, volunteers, and administrators. Why Ireland? Ireland’s reputation as a European tech hub—and its strong research and industry networks—make it an ideal leader for this conversation. 6. Strengthening Evidence and Data for Policy in European Sport Good decisions depend on good information. Ireland can help the EU improve how it gathers, shares, and uses data on sport and physical activity. This includes better cooperation on Sport Satellite Accounts, clearer and more consistent HEPA indicators, and making better use of Eurobarometer and other datasets. Strengthening peer learning between Member States would help everyone benefit from what works. Three Suggested Presidency Priorities To provide a clear and focused message during the Presidency, Ireland could bring together the themes above into three broader pillars: Integrity, Safety and Values in Sport Healthy and Active Communities (HEPA & Inclusion) Sport and Sustainability (Green Transition & Climate Resilience) These three themes reflect Ireland’s strengths, align with EU priorities, and offer real opportunities for meaningful progress during the Presidency."

[REDACTED UNDER GDPR]",,,,1,"EU Economic Security: The EU must enhance the protection of its market while deepening the Single Market. This requires safeguarding existing industries and promoting ambitious growth strategies. The EU Chips Act 2.0 and the Biotech Acts I and II exemplify strategic priorities with significant potential to drive economic growth and reduce dependencies. Moreover, partnerships with third countries should be viewed as essential opportunities, not just risks, to ensure smooth supply chains and robust R&D capabilities. Strategic resilience is vital for the EU to absorb shocks across critical sectors, including pharmaceuticals, digital infrastructure, and public health. Global Trade: The Irish Presidency will need to address the critical issue of trade barriers. Tariffs are currently under negotiation with the USA, creating a complex environment for the biotech and biomanufacturing industries, where tariffs, Section 232 investigations, and Most Favored Nation (MFN) status generate considerable uncertainty. The impact is expected to be particularly felt by the biopharmaceutical industry in Ireland, possibly more so than in other Member States. It is crucial for EU decision-makers to achieve a zero-for-zero tariff on medicines and pharmaceutical ingredients, benefiting both Europe’s industrial base and patients on both sides. Non-tariff barriers will also be of great importance. Industrial Competitiveness: Economic prosperity is at stake, and key regulations and initiatives from the Commission will require the active support of the Presidency to ensure fast and smooth procedures. Simplification measures, along with cross-sectoral and sectoral initiatives, must advance during the Irish Presidency to improve economic sustainability and enhance our industries' ability to invest and innovate. Sustainable development should be prioritized. Manufacturing and R&D activities in the EU must rapidly integrate AI components. Strong alignment and cooperation between policymakers in Brussels, Member States, and industrialists will position Smart Manufacturing as a key opportunity for the EU to close the gap with other regions. Addressing Demographic Challenges and Fertility Declines: Europe’s fertility rate continues to decline, making the fertility gap a crucial issue for our health and social agenda. Eurostat statistics reveal alarming data: Europe’s fertility rate stands at just 1.38 live births per woman, far below the 2.1 needed to sustain population levels. The trend of late parenthood indicates changing lifestyles, necessitating policy adaptations. With age, fertility declines; later parenthood limits options and reduces the opportunity to have the desired number of children. Reports from the European Central Bank warn of the risks posed by demographic challenges to European growth, potentially reducing economic growth in the euro area to levels below those seen during the 2007/8 global financial crisis. Emotional Health and Youth Engagement: Ireland’s 2026 Presidency presents an opportunity to address emotional health challenges among Europe’s youth—a critical pillar for social resilience and competitiveness. Only 44% of young Europeans feel their voices are represented in policy debates, while 83% desire greater involvement. Emotional well-being intersects with demographic concerns: three in ten young Europeans do not intend to have children. Prioritizing emotional health alongside mechanisms for youth participation would strengthen Europe’s social fabric and enhance its competitiveness."

Merck emphasizes the need for Ireland's Presidency to focus on the following policy areas: EU Chips Act 2.0 and Critical Raw Materials Act: These initiatives are essential for securing supply chains for critical raw materials vital for innovation. EU Biotech Acts I and II: These acts present the EU’s first opportunity in decades to implement new and sustainable structural measures, as well as financial instruments, to rapidly restore the EU's leadership in research, innovation, and biomanufacturing. Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) Negotiations: Continued discussions are necessary to enable greater financial support for critical sectors in the EU, directly impacting resilience in public health and food security. This includes talks on the European Competitiveness Fund, emphasizing the need for increased investments in health infrastructure, research and innovation capacity, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Regulatory Simplification: Accelerating simplification measures and omnibus proposals will help reduce regulatory burdens. EU Beating Cancer Plan (EBCP): The Irish Presidency should continue focusing on the EBCP and the EU Cancer Mission, along with national cancer control plans, through sustained focus and budget allocation. Additionally, the implementation of the EU Cardiovascular Health Plan should begin in synergy with the EBCP by adopting the Council Recommendation on health checks. Innovation and management of Rare Diseases: Support for innovation, management, and infrastructure in the rare disease sector is crucial, particularly for early diagnosis capabilities. Merck supports EU Parliament’s call to develop EU Rare Disease Action Plan. Demographic and Fertility Challenges: To address these issues, the Presidency could promote key actions: Support equitable access to fertility care without out-of-pocket payments and ensure necessary funding, including adopting new eligibility criteria. This includes timely diagnosis and equitable access to innovative fertility care with appropriate budgets (including in the MFF). Implement comprehensive reproductive education across generations. Introduce inclusive and family-friendly workplace policies that support individuals' reproductive choices, involving both employers and governments. Women’s Health: The Irish Presidency should prioritize women’s health across all healthcare agenda items. Championing a dedicated EU Women’s Health Strategy will help close persistent gaps in access, research, and outcomes. Initiatives like ClosinGap, driven by Merck, illustrate how addressing gender health disparities can unlock economic growth and improve well-being, reinforcing the EU’s equality and competitiveness agenda. 9. Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD): The implementation of the revised UWWTD should be postponed. The Presidency should revisit this directive to ensure fair and proportionate implementation, as current provisions impose disproportionate costs on pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Merck advocates for a science-based, toxicity-driven model aligned with the polluter-pays principle, emphasizing that the directive's obligations contradict key principles of the EU Treaties: the polluter-pays principle, proportionality, and nondiscrimination."

By focusing on strategic initiatives that enhance competitiveness and resilience, Ireland can demonstrate the tangible and transformative benefits of EU cooperation. Establishing a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce: Ireland should lead the creation of a European Pharmaceutical Taskforce, bringing together the European Commission, Member States, and industry partners. This Taskforce can deliver a high-level Political Declaration that reaffirms the strategic importance of the research-based pharmaceutical sector. By committing to investing in this sector, the EU can secure its position as a global leader in innovation, ensuring that Europe does not become dependent on external sources for ensuring the well-being of its population and critical advancements. Enhancing Regulatory Pathways: The Irish Presidency can significantly reduce time-to-treatment gaps by advocating for predictable and efficient regulatory pathways. By embedding patient voices in health technology assessment (HTA) and regulatory processes, Ireland can ensure that innovative treatments reach those who need them most, improving health outcomes across the Union. Strengthening Health & Sustainability Initiatives: Prioritizing disease-focused initiatives—such as cancer care, cardiovascular health, rare diseases, fertility and brain health —will drive earlier diagnosis and treatment, ultimately reducing health inequalities. Promoting and supporting sustainability initiatives such as use of ePI with removal of paper and reduction of animal testing will decrease carbon footprint and promote maximum ethical standards. Promoting Digital Health Transformation: The Presidency should champion digital health advancements and position EU as unique for leveraging data through EHDS for transparency in decision making based on robust and risk based science, including via interoperable patient records and AI-enabled care pathways. These innovations will not only drive efficiency but also empower patients, facilitate geographical mobility and create new opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and innovators. 5. Regional Impact of the Life Sciences Sector: The Irish Presidency can highlight the regional impact of the life sciences sector by showcasing how EU policies support job creation, training, innovation and research capacity in communities beyond major urban centers. By pursuing these initiatives, the Irish Presidency can make a lasting positive impact on the lives of citizens, the success of businesses, and the vitality of communities across the EU. Through strategic choices now, Ireland can help close the innovation and gender gap, transform our society and build a sustainable future for all."

[REDACTED UNDER GDPR]",,,,4,"Merck believes that effectively communicating the values and benefits of EU membership during Ireland’s Presidency of the Council is essential for creating a sense of belonging and improving health literacy among citizens. Clear Narrative: The Presidency should adopt a clear and relatable narrative that connects EU membership with visible improvements in health, safety, and economic opportunity. This theme emphasizes how collaborative efforts within the EU translate into better healthcare literacy, access, health outcomes, enhanced security, and increased competitiveness for businesses. Showcasing Success Stories: Highlighting specific success stories related to EU membership can illustrate its direct impact on citizens. For instance, the transformative effects of the Single Market on the science & technology sector, or EU Beating Cancer Plan and promoting patient screening awareness and opportunities. Additionally, the benefits of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in ensuring timely approvals of innovative medicines can serve as a powerful testament to the advantages of EU collaboration.However, it remains essential to further simplify the approval process for medicines in Europe and to propose innovative regulatory pathways that encourage the industry to prioritize submitting their groundbreaking medicines in Europe. Citizen-Centered Dialogues: Facilitating dialogues that center around citizens, including youth, and patient experiences is crucial. Organizing patient roundtables can help policymakers understand the reallife implications of their decisions, fostering a sense of connection between EU initiatives and individual lives. With the FutURe program, Merck is connecting the reality of Gen Z and Millennials with policymakers through round tables across European capitals and at the European Parliament. The Presidency of the Council is an excellent opportunity to continue this conversation going so that the concerns and aspirations of the European youth are fully incorporated in the future of the European Union and Merck is willing to continue supporting that. Considering Commissioner Michael McGrath's remit, it would be particularly relevant for the FutURe Project to support the process when a Youth Policy Dialogue is held in Ireland. Digital Storytelling: Utilizing digital storytelling to showcase practical examples of improvements— such as earlier cancer diagnoses, and AI-driven clinical decision support—can illustrate how EU cooperation directly benefits families and communities. Communicating Strategic Resilience: Emphasizing the EU's role in safeguarding critical supply systems and digital & data sharing infrastructure will help citizens appreciate the ongoing relevance of EU actions. In that regard, actions to address demographic challenges and support inclusive actions by design and family friendly workplace will stress the specificity of ‘the European way of life’. Starting debates on how European policies can support work-life balance and address competitiveness and prosperity in a holistic way by starting from people can further support the promotion of EU values and high-standard of life and welfare in public opinion. Inclusive Outreach: Collaborating with stakeholders, including industry representatives, clinicians, and patient organizations, ensures that the outreach efforts are inclusive and reflective of diverse perspectives and backgrounds."

[REDACTED UNDER GDPR]",,,,5,"The European Union is at a pivotal moment where the life sciences sector can significantly contribute to both economic prosperity and transformative health system advancements. The upcoming 2026 EU Presidency presents a unique opportunity to build upon the existing EU Life Sciences Strategy and lead on competitiveness, innovation, and health equity across the Union to increase citizens’ wellbeing. To maximize the impact of this strategy, the EU must focus on several key areas that reinforce its objectives and enhance collaboration among Member States, industry, and research institutions: Strengthening the Regulatory Framework: The EU should continue to streamline regulatory processes to facilitate faster access to innovative therapies and diagnostics. Enhancing regulatory harmonization and establishing robust frameworks for health technology assessments will ensure that patients benefit from timely access to new treatments while maintaining high safety standards. Promoting Investment in Research and Development: The EU must prioritize investment in R&D to close the innovation gap with global competitors. By creating favorable conditions for investment, including tax incentives and funding opportunities for public-private partnerships, the EU can stimulate growth in the life sciences sector and reinforce its position as a global leader in medical research. Championing Disease-Focused Initiatives: The EU should actively promote disease-focused agendas, such as the EU Beating Cancer Plan, the forthcoming Cardiovascular Health Plan, and strategies for addressing rare diseases, fertility and brain health. Coordinating efforts across Member States will enhance integrated care pathways and improve health outcomes for patients and their caregivers. Embracing Carers is a Merck global initiative, in collaboration with leading organizations around the world, to increase awareness, discussion and action about the oftenoverlooked needs of carers. Harnessing Digital Health and Data: The integration of digital health solutions and the European Health Data Space (EHDS) is fundamental to modernizing healthcare delivery and gaining efficiency. The strategy should emphasize the importance of interoperable health data systems, AI-driven tools, and digital health innovations that empower patients and healthcare providers alike. Fostering a Skilled Workforce: Developing a skilled workforce that meets the evolving needs of the life sciences sector is essential. The EU should invest in education and training programs that equip professionals with the necessary skills to thrive in a rapidly changing landscape, ensuring that Europe remains at the forefront of life sciences innovation. Addressing demographic challenges will be critical to ensure that with a shrinking population, any EU competitiveness strategy also includes people and the demographic crisis that Europe is facing (clearly stated in Letta report). By enhancing the existing EU Life Sciences Strategy, the EU can effectively communicate its commitment to fostering a vibrant life sciences sector with sustainable practices that benefit citizens, businesses, the planet and communities across the continent. This approach will not only enhance the EU's credibility and leadership in health and innovation but also serve as a foundation for collaborative efforts that drive sustainable economic growth. In conclusion, strengthening the EU Life Sciences Strategy is crucial for harnessing the full potential of the life sciences sector, ensuring that the 2026 Presidency delivers lasting positive impacts for patients and society as a whole."

We are also active members of an EU-wide organisation representing 5,000 station in Europe.",1,"In Ireland and across Europe, we now face major geo-political, social, economic and environmental change and uncertainty, with a higher risk of disruption thank has been the case in decades. Any of those issues could bring major challenges for the citizens of the European Union and all of its Member States, and therefore there is a need for preparedness and societal resilience. The European Commission has recognised this in its 2025 Strategic Foresight Report. A major risk is constituted by the ability of the social media/web platforms to promote and distribute misinformation and disinformation, who could confuse, deceive or inflame populations and cause major difficulties for public authorities in managing crises. We therefore believe that the unique aspects of radio in promoting trust, in delivering accurate information, and in creating cohesion have huge potential to assist policymakers. Radio is highly trusted as shown by surveys including Eurobarometer. It is the “together-medium” because it involves listeners collectively tuning in. This fits with the definition of “broadcasting” and is vital for cohesion and is a bulwark against division. Radio is also the only real-time medium, because it can respond to and cover issues quickly. Very importantly it is free of charge to listeners. The first theme we suggest for Ireland’s Presidency is: “Promoting resilience by protecting trusted media in Europe” As a result of imposition of barriers to free trade, European businesses are now facing major challenges. One of the major ways this has impacted them is the radical difference between regulatory barriers and structures in Europe. The European Union has recognised this through the simplification process, and this now needs to be expanded to the media sector where European media organisations lack a level playing-field as they compete against very large platforms which have almost no regulation of editorial content or of commercial advertising or operations. In contrast, the licensed radio sector (as an example) faces more than 26 separate restrictions in those areas. Therefore, a move to proportionate, risk-based and equitable regulation which allows broadcasters to be nimble and agile is needed. Similar extension of simplification required for all European businesses. As part of this, the European Commission is going to be reviewing the issue of State Aid restrictions on the broadcast media in Europe. Those restrictions have caused major difficulties for measures to support the Irish radio sector but could if reformed, contribute to a more supportive environment and help protect this crucial sector. In line with this, the second proposed theme we proposed for Ireland’s Presidency is: “Progressing a level playing-field in regulation for European businesses” The above two topics are ones which are new and “meaty” with potential to be expanded and to fit with European strategic objectives. They have not been addressed in the last five EU Presidencies so there is potential for Ireland to make its mark as a smaller Member State but one with expertise and knowledge, and a commitment to democracy and open markets."

It is also highly consumer friendly: free at the point of access, universally available, doesn’t require users to be digital savvy, caters to people of differing abilities, provides entertainment, local news and companionship. It plays a key preparedness role in times of crisis. In times of crisis, broadcast radio provides a highly resilient communications channel for public authorities to reach citizens, as we saw in Portugal and Spain (the only way people were able to get news updates on the situation was by listening to broadcast radio – many did so in their cars). It is not surprising that radio is included in the EU’s population preparedness survival kit. More than 1 million radio sets were sold in Spain in the 24 hours after the major power grid outage. However, the future of radio in cars is at risk: Listeners could be excluded by car manufacturers in a process already underway and radio is becoming increasingly dependent on platforms, manufacturers and technology operators to be in the car. Vehicle makers are starting to remove broadcast radio receivers from cars. These policy areas are within the portfolio of Commissioner Michael McGrath and EVP Virkkunen and directly relevant to Commissioner Lahbib’s responsibilities. EU action is required in order to secure radio’s presence and findability in cars over the longer term. The policy solutions: (1) mandate broadcast radio in cars by updating art 113 of the European Electronic Communications Code (which regulates DAB+ radio in cars); (2) designate virtual assistants under the Digital Markets Act (VAs – think Apple Car Play and Google Android Auto – intermediate access to radio in cars, in addition to smart speakers); (3) issue guidance on the implementation of article 20 of the European Media Freedom Act (configuration of the user interface) to ensure that radio remains easily accessible and findable via in-car user interfaces. There is potential in 2026 for an “omnibus” approach to all of the above, as well as the Digital Networks Act. The Irish Government has the opportunity to contribute to a review of the broadcasting State Aid rules, so that radio stations in Ireland and across Europe could receive funding to help deliver the public service content such as news and current affairs which is so vital and which cannot currently be supported. The Irish Presidency can also utilise these themes to progress simplification of business regulations and therefore help create economic growth in the indigenous business sector in all Member States."

These themes are not ones that would in any way cause division because there are radio stations in each and every Member State and awareness of the value they provide. The themes would, accordingly, have support from other EU Members and they are firmly within EU policy objectives and strategic areas, where the Members and the Council are in agreement (democracy, resilience and economic growth, in particular by European SME’s). The Independent Broadcasters of Ireland (IBI) is a member of the Association of European Radios (AER) whose member associations in total represent 5,000 commercial radio stations in Europe. IBI and AER also collaborate on these issues with the large state broadcasters across the European Union through the “Radio Ready” initiative to protect access to radio. Therefore, this will have broad industry support. That support will be very useful because all of the stations in Europe understand the vital nature of the issue (up to 50% of listening to radio is in cars across Europe). There is also widespread support for action on these issues within the Irish political landscape and among Irish MEPs, as IBI can attest have met a wide range of political representatives in Ireland and in Brussels. A number of pieces of European legislation which we have mentioned earlier will come to critical stages in their development during the period of the Irish Presidency and therefore there is potential for Ireland to make concrete progress on these issues and have a significant number of milestone achievement. Ireland’s reputation for constructive leadership, a reputation as an honest broker in complex negotiations and its history a bridge between east and west and north and south in Europe will put it in good stead to manage these issues successfully."

We are also active members of an EU-wide organisation representing 5,000 station in Europe.",4,"We believe that communication of Ireland’s themes and initiatives will be vital and can be assisted by a clear and effective programme of initiatives. We support the holding of an event in Ireland during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU on the topic of “EU democracy, resilience and preparedness: radio as a key enabler”. In the run-up to Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU. there will also be potential for IBI to cooperate with the Irish Permanent Representation in Brussels on briefings and a potential briefing event. Then during the Presidency, in co-operation with the Irish Government we are suggesting that one Irish event on these themes would take place in Limerick and would consist of a conference opened by Minister Patrick O’Donovan leading the Council on these issues where the regulatory and policy issues around promoting resilience, protecting trusted media, and putting in place a level playing-field for European media organisations, could be discussed and analysed. This could involve a large number of Irish independent radio stations from all over Ireland bringing the Outside Broadcast vans to Limerick and hosting their morning current affairs shows simultaneously, demonstrating the value of the medium. Possibly this could take place in July and there is definite potential for the involvement of other European stations in this initiative, drawing attention to the vital role that radio plays across the whole of the EU. The radio sector across Europe has thousands of stations and hundreds of millions of listeners, and the sector in Ireland also has a total listenership of 70 per cent of radio listeners, measured daily. Local radio in Ireland is the jointly most trusted medium in Ireland. We believe that the themes/topics and policy objectives are ones which will resonate with citizens and reflect well on Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the EU."

It is also in line with President von der Leyen’s State of the Union address which was strongly supportive of media resilience and simplification of regulation. In the President’s State of the Union letter of intent, she said: “Our work on internal security will go hand-in-hand with measures to reinforce the resilience of our democracies and societies, from strengthening our collective capacity to withstand threats to tackling information manipulation.” “We will simplify the regulatory environment with a single harmonised set of rules and work to improve access to venture capital – so our companies can find what they need to grow right here in Europe.” The latest Programme for Government in Ireland is also very strongly supportive of the themes and actions proposed in this submission. It sets out the following policy objectives: “Explore options to maintain access to local and commercial radio.” and “Ensure accessible funding for local radio and print media to support the provision of objective news and current affairs content, taking into account Coimisiún na Meán recommendations.” Based on the above, we believe that this submission is worthy of consideration and we would be delighted to provide further information and to work with the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Media to progress these ideas.”"

The “competitiveness agenda” has been used to prioritise business interests over basic protections for workers, human rights defenders and communities affected by corporate abuse who are now likely to face insurmountable barriers to access justice for harms caused by companies headquartered or operating in the EU. Moreover, the process resulted from undue corporate influence, in particular, the interests of fossil fuel and extractives. This approach undermines the EU’s credibility and the core values it claims to uphold. The Irish Presidency must work to ensure that EU’s strategic agenda commitment to “respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities” does not continue to be breached. Ireland has a responsibility to ensure that future Omnibus processes do not follow this same deregulatory approach. Ireland must prioritise rights-centred policymaking, ensure meaningful consultation with impacted stakeholders throughout all stages of the lawmaking process, including workers, communities, human rights defenders, and environmental organisations, and protect what remains of the Green Deal. Ireland must champion rights-centred policymaking and insist that these consultations are substantive and transparent. It is essential that Ireland support the full implementation of the European Green Deal and resist attempts to weaken existing environmental and human rights standards under the guise of “simplification.” Ireland must correct the narrative around “competitiveness” and “simplification” and ensure that business interests do not continue to be prioritised over essential protections for workers, communities and the environment. These terms are increasingly being misused to justify lowering protections rather than strengthening long-term resilience, responsible business conduct, and a sustainable, fair economy. (2) Protecting civil society space Ireland must prioritise the protection of civil society space and address the growing problem of corporate capture in EU policymaking. The process for Omnibus I has shown how disproportionate industry influence can distort policy outcomes, marginalise affected communities and prevent them from accessing justice and undermine public trust. A true democracy requires strong, independent civil society organisations that can advocate for human rights and environmental protection without undue pressure or exclusion. Ireland must ensure transparent and balanced stakeholder engagement processes across all files, and champion initiatives that safeguard the role of civil society and human rights defenders within the EU. (3) Rebuilding democratic legitimacy and transparency Ireland must act as a stabilising force during its Presidency by strengthening democratic legitimacy, transparency and accountability in EU decision-making. The backlash against the CSDDD and other Green Deal files exposed a growing disconnect between EU institutions and the public, fuelled by undue corporate influence, opaque negotiations, last-minute political deals and alignment with far-right parties in breach of the longstanding “cordon sanitaire” in place for the protection of democratic norms. Ireland should advocate for transparent, democratic legislative processes, better access to information, and robust oversight of Council decision-making. Greater transparency and meaningful engagement with impacted stakeholders will help restore trust, ensure evidence-based policymaking, and reaffirm the EU’s commitment to its founding principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law."

The Presidency must play a central role in safeguarding the remaining elements of the European Green Deal, strengthening protections against corporate abuse, and rebuilding trust in EU institutions through accountability and transparency. 1. Defending and completing the Green Deal files Ireland must prioritise the completion and effective implementation of key Green Deal files that remain vulnerable to political dilution or delay. This includes defending climate, biodiversity, and environmental legislation that has come under pressure from deregulatory agendas. 2. Preventing deregulation through future Omnibus processes Ireland must ensure that no future Omnibus initiatives repeat the untransparent, undemocratic deregulatory approach taken by the institutions. The Presidency must promote transparent, standalone legislative processes, proper impact assessments, and meaningful consultation with affected stakeholders—including workers, communities, and civil society organisations. 3. Strengthening enforcement mechanisms Ireland must build robust enforcement mechanisms for existing human rights and environmental legislation, ensuring that laws already on the books deliver real-world protection. This includes supporting strong national oversight bodies, promoting cooperation between Member States, and ensuring that enforcement guidance for directives is build on the needs of workers and communities in the Global South who face the most severe impacts of corporate abuse. 4. Safeguarding and advancing key regulatory frameworks Ireland must take a proactive role in defending and advancing critical regulatory frameworks that underpin human rights, environmental protection, and social justice. Key areas include: Deforestation Regulation: ensuring full and timely implementation of the EU Deforestation Regulation, resisting efforts to narrow its scope, weaken enforcement, or allow loopholes that would undermine forest protection and Indigenous rights. Chemicals, food and feed safety, and critical raw materials: safeguarding robust EU chemicals policy (REACH), pesticide regulations, and food safety standards is essential to prevent deregulation that could endanger workers, communities, and ecosystems. The Presidency should support strong enforcement, oversight, and transparency in these areas, ensuring that risk assessments and regulatory decisions are guided by scientific evidence and public interest. Digital and investment frameworks: Ireland should defend regulatory measures that protect citizens’ digital rights, privacy, and access to essential services. In the context of trade and investment, the Presidency must scrutinise investment court systems and dispute settlement frameworks to ensure they do not undermine environmental, social, or human rights protections. Global Gateway and external action: Ireland should ensure that the Global Gateway strategy and EU external action uphold human rights, environmental standards, and democratic values. Civil society in Europe and the Global South has so far had minimal participation, undermining transparency and accountability. The Presidency can lead efforts to embed meaningful stakeholder engagement, public scrutiny, and impact monitoring, ensuring that decision-making is guided by both European and, crucially, Global South civil society. A UN Treaty on Business and Human Rights: The Presidency must take a position in support of a strong UN Binding Treaty on Business and Human Rights (UNBT), championing the priorities of Global South civil society groups to ensure enforceable corporate accountability, effective remedies for affected communities, and the inclusion of human rights considerations in all corporate-related EU legislation. “28th Regime” and human rights enforcement: The Presidency must prioritise embedding human rights and social protections into EU regulatory initiatives, including new financial or investment frameworks (sometimes referred to as the “28th regime”), ensuring that human rights due diligence is central to corporate and investment activities."

This requires strengthening rights protections, engaging with rightsholders, safeguarding democratic processes, and ensuring that laws already in place deliver meaningful outcomes. 1. Put human rights, workers’ rights and environmental safeguards at the centre of Council work For people and communities to benefit, EU legislation must maintain the highest possible standards of protection. The Irish Presidency can play a decisive role by ensuring that Council discussions prioritise workers and communities affected by corporate harm, and those most vulnerable to climate breakdown and environmental degradation. A rights-centred Council agenda will help ensure that EU law offers protection for individuals negatively impacted by the activities of corporate actors. 2. Rebuild trust in democratic processes Recent years have seen growing public concern about opaque processes, last-minute amendments, and undue corporate influence. The European Ombudsman recently decided that the Commission’s undemocratic environmental rollbacks through Omnibus I amounted to “maladministration”. Enhancing transparency, meaningfully engaging with rightsholders, improving access to documents, and clearly communicating Member State positions would help improve democratic legitimacy. 3. Ensure that laws already adopted work in practice Ireland must lead on strong implementation and enforcement of existing human rights, labour and environmental laws, including resisting efforts to delay or weaken enforcement obligations. 4. Protect remaining standards on human rights and environmental protection Ireland must guarantee that no further laws are eroded through deregulatory processes that prioritise business interests and “competitiveness” and degrade legal certainty for those impacted by corporate abuse. 5. Protect civil society space so that policymaking reflects real needs Ireland must begin to defend civil society space throughout Council processes and ensuring diverse stakeholder engagement to address power imbalances, counteract undue corporate influence and ensure that the experiences of workers and communities impacted by corporate abuse are reflected and protected in EU-lawmaking."

It must ensure that the EU’s Strategic Agenda commitment to “‘reduce the bureaucratic and regulatory burden at all levels” does not continue to impinge on the rights of workers and communities or on the aim of achieving a just and fair climate transition. Meaningful engagement with stakeholders including civil society organisations, trade unions, local communities, and vulnerable groups is essential to demonstrate that the EU works for the people it represents, not just for business interests. Irish media has highlighted concerns about the privileging of corporate interests over civil society and unions in EU legislative processes, including around the Omnibus I simplification package, with internal lobbying strategies by multinational firms exposed in leaked files. Civil society plays a vital role in safeguarding the public good. Unlike private actors accountable to shareholders, civil society represents the collective interests of citizens, advocating for human rights, social justice, environmental protection, and fair labour standards. Ireland’s Presidency can lead by example by systematically including civil society and citizen representatives in Council discussions, consultations, and preparatory working groups, ensuring that EU decisions reflect diverse perspectives and lived experiences. A concrete step would be to institutionalise structured dialogues with stakeholders on key EU initiatives, making these engagements transparent and actionable. For instance, during negotiations of legislation such as Omnibus I, the exclusion of civil society eroded trust. By actively creating spaces where workers, local communities, and civil society organisations can influence policy outcomes, Ireland’s Presidency can show that EU decision-making is participatory, inclusive, and responsive."

A robust treaty is necessary to close the accountability gaps left by voluntary standards and fragmented national laws, and to provide real access to remedy for affected communities, particularly in the Global South, where corporate impacts are most acute. This approach complements the EU’s own due diligence initiatives while amplifying the voices and priorities of Global South groups who are leading calls for enforceable international standards, effective extraterritorial regulation, and mechanisms that safeguard human rights defenders and gender-responsive protections."

Apart from the Omnibus initiatives, this would include a review of horizontal legislation interfering with sectoral legislation or even with each other (e.g. the EUDR, the PPWR and certain restrictions under REACH, such as the PFAS restriction)."
284,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/6b0fff0f/Zoetis_-_Submission_284.docx,Zoetis,Business,Animal Health,"National, EU-wide and global",2,"There is a need to streamline EU legislation in general and reduce the administrative burden, which is one of the stated aims of the various Omnibus efforts currently ongoing. However, it seems that the current approach is rather fragmented, with a lack of attention to which impacts cross-sectoral legislation may have on specific sectors. For example, while it is recognised that veterinary medicines availability in the EU already is an issue, restrictions under REACH may have a profound impact on our ability to innovate or even manufacture and supply existing veterinary medicines, vaccines and biopharmaceuticals in the EU. New legislation such as the EUDR and the PPWR is imposing an unprecedented administrative burden on several sectors including veterinary medicines, which once more may affect medicines availability, especially those with limited markets. Therefore, an overarching review of potential unintended consequences of these separate legislations, even when simplified, would be welcomed. The long-awaited REACH proposal may also present opportunities. By the same token, there are legislative activities which may boost innovation in the EU, for example the Biotech Act currently under preparation. Support from the Irish Presidency for a comprehensive, cross‑sectoral Act aiming for biotechnology to seamlessly move from the laboratory to the market would be welcomed. A comprehensive Biotech Act must ensure veterinary innovation is fully within its scope under a One Health approach. Another area of focus that could support availability and access to medicines is the digital, data and AI space where discussion on the EU-wide adoption of eLeaflets for medicines and AI approaches to support manufacturing and enhancing R&D and regulatory productivity could all bring benefits. EU Biotech Act: The Presidency should steer the Council’s work toward a cross‑sectoral approach, which explicitly includes veterinary biotech and provides proportionate and science-based tools shortening time‑to‑access without lowering safety. REACH Proposal: Under the current legislation, medicines are exempt from authorisation, but not from restrictions. This is creating numerous issues, mostly at our manufacturing sites. In many cases, substitution is not (legally) possible, and restrictions therefore can severely disrupt manufacturing and supply of medicines – with proposed restrictions potentially driving manufacturing completely out of the EEA. Exempting medicines and their manufacturing from restrictions and maintaining the benefit-risk approach from Reg 2019/6 would be a solution to these issues. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR): The Presidency should make AMR a top priority under a One Health approach and drive full implementation of the 2023 Council Recommendations to strengthen stewardship, surveillance and innovation across veterinary and food‑producing sectors. The Presidency should explore mechanisms to support and accelerate R&D and regulatory approval of medicines and tools that address AMR."

The focus should be in policies that reduce timelines to support solutions reaching veterinarians and livestock farmers. For businesses (and employment): Strong support for innovation in the EU (e.g. a truly cross‑sector Biotech Act), and coherent horizontal chemical and environmental legislation (e.g. REACH, PPWR, EURD and others) will sustain investment and manufacturing in Europe. Zoetis’ footprint in the EU (R&D centres, mAb and API production sites in Ireland, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Italy, Denmark and Norway) shows Europe’s capacity to innovate for the EU citizens and export innovation globally when the regulatory environment is predictable."

In Europe, approximately half of the citizens live with a pet, meanwhile 94% of pet owners globally consider their pets to be part of their family. This is a clear signal that the human-animal bond is both mainstream and relevant to everyday wellbeing and social cohesion. Loneliness is now recognised as a public-health priority. Evidence shows that contact with companion animals can reduce loneliness, relieve stress and anxiety, and support health ageing, complementing social care and mental health strategies. Surveys have found that in Europe 85% of respondents believe that interaction with a companion animal can help reduce loneliness. Additionally, a study showed that adult pet owners have about 15% fewer annual doctors visits than non-owners. Against this context, the human-animal bond (HAB) is a practical, people-centred approach for EU policymaking. The HAB is the mutually beneficial, dynamic relationship between people and companion animals. This relationship is shaped by behaviours that are essential to the health and wellbeing of both. Viewed through policy, HAB offers a practical, people‑centred lens because its benefits span mental, physical and social health for families and communities, while also improving animal welfare. The Irish Council Presidency has the opportunity to champion initiatives that can help realise the HAB and improve conditions for both humans and pets by: Making Europe more pet‑inclusive by addressing structural barriers that prevent people from realising the benefits of the HAB, such as housing policies. The EU could promote pet‑friendly standards and guidance and encourage Member States and cities to pilot pet‑inclusive urban programmes. Improving access to veterinary care and better support veterinarians. This could include targeted support for underserved communities, better affordable care options, and innovations in how veterinary services are delivered (e.g. through better digital solutions). Embedding One Health-One Welfare thinking in social and public health policy. For instance, by considering companion animals in disaster preparedness and public health strategies, preventing families to choose between safety and their animals.

Distributed Networks for Innovation: To enable innovation in Europe, the networks of the future need to be distributed, interoperable, and highly interconnected. Surging advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and evolving infrastructure demands are coinciding to define the Internet’s next frontier. The success of the European innovation economy relies on robust, universal connectivity that can handle massive machine-to-machine exchanges, as well as on distributed edge networks to enable very low latency interactions. Public policy should support the development of these distributed networks without creating barriers to innovation or artificial hurdles. The EU needs a seamless integration of the ecosystem, where traffic flows smoothly to consumers without regulatory barriers that fragment the Internet. Competitiveness through Openness: The EU must close its innovation gap to regain its competitiveness on the world stage. This requires an economy where companies and individual developers can easily build new applications that everyone wants and needs. The Presidency should support the Commission’s objective to simplify and streamline EU legislation in the digital policy space. The focus should be on creating less regulation and red tape, not more. A competitive digital ecosystem depends on openness, choice, and interoperability. Protectionist measures and limiting choice toEU-only solutions risk causing economic stagnation, reducing resilience and security, and increasing costs for European businesses. Cybersecurity via Global Intelligence: Effective cybersecurity protection inherently requires a global network and reach. Cyber threats are growing each year, and distributed networks play an important role in stopping attacks close to where they originated. ""Sovereignty"" in this context should mean the freedom to choose the most secure and interoperable systems. Policies must allow European entities to leverage global datasets of malicious cyber indicators to effectively detect and mitigate risks using AI and machine learning, rather than being limited by non-technical geographical restrictions."

Digital Networks Act (DNA): The Presidency should recognize that the IP interconnection market in Europe is healthy, sustainable, and competitive. Regulatory intervention, such as dispute resolution mechanisms, would act as ""network fees through the backdoor"" and increase costs for European businesses. The Presidency should caution against such heavy-handed intervention and instead focus on streamlining and simplifying existing obligations to facilitate high-quality connectivity in Europe. Expanding the scope of telecom rules to cloud and content delivery networks would lead to increased costs for operators and end users, less incentives to invest in infrastructure and be contrary to the goals of simplification and reducing red tape. Cloud and AI Development Act (CAIDA): European companies need sustained access to fast and reliable distributed edge networks to reap the benefits of AI innovation. To strengthen the EU’s cloud and AI capabilities, the Presidency should prioritize an approach that fosters an open, competitive, and innovative digital ecosystem. This means promoting freedom of choice, interoperability, and diversification over forced localization or strict establishment criteria. The Presidency should encourage ""multi-model"" AI strategies and multi-cloud architectures to prevent vendor lock-in and ensure resilience. Public procurement rules should encourage competition and the ability to use the best service for the government's needs, avoiding non-technical exclusion criteria. Cybersecurity Act (CSA) Revision: For the CSA revision, the Presidency should aim for targeted regulatory intervention that makes the adoption process of European cybersecurity certification schemes more open, transparent, and inclusive. Crucially, the Presidency must ensure that certification schemes are strictly limited to technical requirements. Non-technical ""sovereignty"" criteria, such as ownership restrictions or data localization, should be explicitly excluded, as they can harm cybersecurity by limiting the ability to pool global threat intelligence and mitigate large-scale attacks."

Businesses need the right conditions to flourish, including access to non-gated and open-source AI models and global infrastructure. Removing unnecessary red tape and avoiding new administrative burdens, such as extending telecom rules to cloud and content delivery networks, will allow European startups and SMEs to focus on innovation rather than compliance. A pro-competition environment that avoids vendor lock-in will lower costs and improve access to world-class technologies. For Security and Resilience The Council can best achieve these goals not through forced localisation or protectionism, but through a commitment to multi-cloud architectures, open standards, interoperability, and a competitive, non-discriminatory market. True sovereignty is realised through freedom of choice and a diversified, resilient supply chain can protect communities by ensuring governments and businesses have access to best in class technologies. For People and Communities The networks of the future will bring computing power closer to the end-user, slashing latency and enabling innovation in real-time applications like autonomous vehicles and advanced healthcare tools. Supporting the development of distributed edge networks also advances the EU’s sustainability goals. Edge computing mitigates concerns regarding the geographical concentration of large data centers and their associated strain on local natural resources, such as energy and water. By processing data closer to the source, these networks improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of digital services."

It provides flexible, on-demand transport, improves connectivity where public transport is limited, and supports greener mobility through high utilisation and rapid fleet electrification. Yet the experience for passengers varies widely across the EU because services remain governed by fragmented, pre-digital rules. These inconsistencies directly affect consumers through longer waiting times, higher prices and uneven availability. Ireland’s Presidency offers an opportunity to focus on themes that strengthen the Single Market, support the green and digital transitions and improve the regulatory environment for digital services. These priorities are central to ensuring the EU remains competitive, cohesive and capable of delivering tangible benefits to citizens and businesses. 1. Enhancing the Single Market for citizens and businesses The Single Market remains one of the EU’s most powerful assets, yet is still held back by administrative and regulatory barriers, especially in services. Removing unnecessary national obstacles is essential for economic cohesion and for ensuring citizens and businesses can benefit fully from cross-border opportunities. Sector example: In passenger mobility, the Single Market does not yet operate as intended. A person may use the same ride-hailing app anywhere in Europe, but the service received can differ dramatically depending on local rules. In some cities, a vehicle arrives within minutes; in others, passengers face long waits due to restrictions such as return-to-garage rules, licence caps or advance booking requirements. These inconsistencies create uncertainty for consumers and limit competitiveness. A Presidency priority on strengthening the Single Market for services would help align rules, reduce fragmentation and ensure citizens can expect accessible, predictable and affordable services wherever they travel. 2. Advancing a competitive, green and digital transition Europe’s transition to a more sustainable and digital economy requires coordinated action. Mobility services - public transport, taxis, PHVs and emerging digital solutions - play a key role in reducing emissions, improving efficiency and enabling multimodal travel. Sector example: When operational rules allow drivers to operate efficiently, mobility services can reduce empty kilometres, accelerate electrification and strengthen first- and last-mile connections. Removing outdated restrictions improves environmental outcomes and user experience. A Presidency focus on supporting competitive, sustainable mobility ecosystems would reinforce EU objectives on climate, innovation and digitalisation. 3. Improving regulation for digital services Digital services are integral to how citizens interact with transport, accommodation, retail and public services. Ensuring that rules remain transparent, coherent and future-proof is essential for maintaining trust and enabling innovation. EU legislation such as the Digital Services Act, AI Act and Platform Work Directive introduces important standards for transparency and accountability. However, fragmented national implementation risks creating divergent rules and an uneven experience for users. A Presidency priority on consistent, transparent and user-centred digital regulation would help ensure platforms meet clear expectations across the EU, consumers benefit from reliable information, and the Single Market remains a competitive environment for digital innovation."

As Presidency, Ireland should build on this momentum by initiating Council Conclusions on the actions required to complete the Single Market, with a particular emphasis on sectors where fragmentation is most visible to citizens - such as mobility and digitally enabled transport services. These conclusions should identify priority areas for reducing administrative burdens, ensuring regulatory coherence, and bringing services more fully into the Single Market framework. Within this broader effort, the Irish Presidency should focus specifically on the persistent fragmentation affecting private hire vehicles (PHVs) and ride-hailing services. The Commission’s Notice on well-functioning and sustainable passenger transport-on-demand already acknowledges that outdated, disproportionate national and local rules impede the sector’s ability to support EU mobility, competitiveness and climate objectives. Yet progress remains limited, and Member States continue to apply divergent rules that undermine the functioning of the Single Market. This fragmentation has significant implications for citizens and businesses. By 2030, around 190 million Europeans are expected to use ride-hailing services, and each €1 spent generates €1.10 in wider economic value - supporting tourism, local commerce and service sector employment. Ride-hailing vehicles also electrify twice as fast as private cars and emit 34% less CO₂ per kilometre, demonstrating clear alignment with EU climate ambitions. However, the sector cannot realise these benefits fully under the current patchwork of rules, which increase waiting times, raise prices and limit availability in suburban and underserved areas. Advancing modern, coherent rules for PHVs The Irish Presidency should therefore ensure progress on a Council-led process to reduce fragmentation in passenger mobility services. This should form part of the Presidency’s broader Single Market agenda and include the following elements: ● Follow up the Single Market Strategy with Council Conclusions identifying regulatory barriers in PHV markets and outlining the steps needed for modernisation and coherence across Member States. Promote mutual recognition of professional licences, allowing qualified drivers to operate across administrative boundaries without repeated or duplicative processes. Address outdated entry requirements, such as legacy map-reading exams or paper-based procedures, which slow down market entry and reduce service availability. Ensure operational rules are proportionate and evidence-based, including booking-time requirements, return-to-garage obligations, lane access rules and other local restrictions that currently distort competition. Guarantee consistent treatment of traditional taxis and digital intermediaries, avoiding regulatory asymmetries that create inefficiencies for consumers. Practical benefit for citizens: shorter waiting times better availability during peak hours more affordable rides Improved coverage in suburban and rural areas more efficient, lower-emission operations in urban centres"

A coordinated EU approach would make a real difference for people, businesses, and communities, particularly in how they access and benefit from daily transport. 1. Impact for People (passengers and citizens) Across the EU, passengers face inconsistent service levels because local rules restrict the supply of licensed private hire vehicles (PHVs) and create artificial delays. These barriers translate directly into higher prices, longer waiting times and reduced reliability - especially for those who depend on on-demand transport outside major city centres. Issues affecting people today: Higher prices caused by licence caps and limited supply. Longer waits due to mandatory pre-booking times (e.g., 3-hour minimum booking in Greece, making spontaneous trips impossible). Reduced availability, especially at peak times or in suburban areas. Limited accessibility, as rules restrict PHV pick-up points or access to lanes used by taxis (e.g., Brussels, where passengers cannot be picked up directly at train stations). Uneven safety and convenience, particularly for women, late-night travellers, and those with reduced mobility. Benefits of EU-level action: A more coherent framework across Member States would mean shorter waiting times, more predictable service, more competitive pricing and better accessibility for vulnerable groups. Passengers would experience reliable mobility regardless of where they travel in the EU. 2. Impact for businesses (drivers, SMEs and platforms) Drivers and mobility businesses face significant administrative burdens due to fragmented licensing, duplicative exams and inconsistent operational rules. Issues affecting businesses today: High entry barriers (multiple licences, lengthy exams, outdated requirements). Operational inefficiencies such as forced return-to-garage rules, creating unnecessary empty kilometres. Uneven competitiveness where traditional taxis and PHVs operate under different obligations. Difficulty scaling across regions, especially when rules change between neighbouring municipalities. These barriers reduce earning opportunities for drivers and undermine innovation for platforms and SMEs. Benefits of EU-level action: Proportionate, evidence-based rules would reduce red tape, allow drivers to work more efficiently, and increase income potential. For example, removing return-to-garage obligations can reduce empty kilometres by up to 40%, improving both driver earnings and passenger availability. A more predictable Single Market also supports SMEs offering dispatch, fleet, or mobility-related services. 3. Impact for communities (cities, regions and local economies) Fragmented rules affect not only individuals and businesses but the wider functioning of cities. Issues affecting communities today: Congestion and pollution, driven by inefficient operational requirements. Reduced accessibility, especially in areas with limited public transport. Slower transitions to clean mobility, as today’s restrictions discourage fleet electrification. Lost economic potential for tourism, hospitality and nightlife. Benefits of EU-level action: Smart, harmonised rules - such as allowing continuous operation instead of empty returns and ensuring PHVs can use the same priority lanes as taxis - lead to fewer unnecessary kilometres, cleaner air and more efficient traffic flows. Improved mobility also supports local businesses, cultural venues, airports, hotels and tourism, making cities more welcoming for residents and visitors alike."

When the EU removes barriers, simplifies rules and creates a true Single Market, people feel the results directly: services become more reliable, prices fall, and opportunities expand. A strong example is aviation liberalisation, where common EU rules opened air travel to citizens across Europe. Flights became cheaper, faster and safer, competition increased, and Europeans could suddenly move freely across the continent. It also enabled Irish companies - such as Ryanair - to grow into European champions, connecting smaller cities, boosting tourism and supporting local economies. This is Europe at its best: harmonisation that delivers clear benefits for citizens while empowering businesses to scale across borders. Ireland’s Presidency can use this narrative - Europe that delivers - to illustrate why deepening the Single Market remains central to people’s daily experiences. Just as aviation harmonisation transformed long-distance travel, a modern approach to mobility services can improve how people move within and between cities. Whether heading to an early hospital appointment, getting home safely after an evening out, or accessing transport where public options are limited, millions of Europeans depend on reliable mobility - but today their experience varies widely because of fragmented rules. Demonstrating that EU coordination can make mobility more available, affordable and sustainable helps citizens see how the EU directly improves their daily options. Human stories make these benefits tangible. A parent getting home faster because transport is more predictable; an older resident accessing dependable door-to-door mobility; someone in a rural or suburban area finally having access to transport after public services end for the day - these examples show how EU action supports inclusion, safety and convenience. They help citizens understand that EU policymaking is not abstract but something that can make everyday life easier. Ireland can also highlight how EU-wide digital legislation - from the Digital Services Act to platform transparency rules - protects consumers and workers by ensuring clear information, accountability and safeguards across borders. Many citizens do not realise that the transparency they expect when they book travel, order a service or use a digital platform is guaranteed by common EU rules. Making this link explicit strengthens trust and demonstrates the real-world value of EU membership. Finally, a sense of ownership can be built through local engagement and concrete evidence. Presenting before-and-after improvements - such as shorter waiting times, more accessible mobility for people with reduced mobility, or increased availability of electric vehicles - allows citizens to see the results of EU coordination in their own communities. When improvements are visible and practical, people feel pride in Ireland’s role and greater confidence in the EU as a project that delivers for them."

It highlights the significant cost of regulatory fragmentation and identifies the economic, social and environmental benefits that a more harmonised approach could unlock. Ride-hailing is used daily by millions of Europeans and is projected to reach 190 million users by 2030. The sector already contributes substantially to the wider economy: every €1 spent on a trip generates €1.10 in broader economic value, supporting local businesses, tourism and tens of thousands of indirect jobs. It is also a fast route to greener mobility, with ride-hailing fleets electrifying twice as quickly as private cars in many cities. However, progress is constrained by a patchwork of pre-digital rules. In two-thirds of Member States, barriers such as licence caps, long licensing processes, mandatory “return-to-garage” requirements, minimum fares or restrictions on booking times reduce the number of available drivers and inflate costs for consumers. This results in longer waiting times, reduced availability at peak hours, and higher prices - especially affecting people who rely on ride-hailing at night, in suburban areas, or where public transport options are limited. The study draws on new modelling by Ricardo, showing the scale of the opportunity if Europe were to modernise and align its rules: ● Create up to 219,000 additional driver income opportunities could be created in six cities alone if licence caps were removed. Driver incomes could rise by 5-10% where unnecessary operational restrictions (like return-to-garage rules) are eliminated. CO₂ emissions could fall by up to 29% in cities where empty kilometres are significantly reduced. Sector revenues could increase by 11% in cities where pricing restrictions are relaxed and supply can better meet demand. These findings illustrate that smarter regulation - not deregulation - can deliver significant improvements in service availability, driver earnings and environmental performance. To address these challenges, the study recommends three actions: Develop an EU-wide framework for ride-hailing and taxi services to ensure consistent, modern rules across Member States. Create a level playing field by aligning rights and obligations for taxis and ride-hailing, removing outdated restrictions that distort competition and reduce consumer choice. Promote upfront pricing as a European standard, ensuring passengers have transparent, predictable fares before they book. Overall, the study concludes that Europe has a clear opportunity to build a more connected, efficient and sustainable mobility market. Harmonisation would make services more reliable and affordable for citizens, improve working conditions for drivers and support EU objectives on competitiveness, inclusion and the green transition."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3. A Future-Oriented Europe Built on Innovation and Collaboration Ireland’s strong reputation in digital innovation offers an opportunity to promote Digital Innovation for Health, leveraging the European Health Data Space and interoperable, patient-centred tools. For individuals at risk of serious allergic reactions, seamless access to medical information across borders can prevent emergencies and support the free movement of people. The Presidency can also prioritise harmonised awareness-raising, institutional readiness, and capacity building, ensuring schools, businesses, and public institutions are equipped and trained to respond effectively to life-threatening health incidents."

By choosing “Knowledge Based Healthcare” this theme recognises the unique strengths that Ireland brings as a knowledge based economy to the healthcare challenges facing the EU. We recommend that brain health is featured as a key priority under this theme. Neurological disorders represent one of the most significant health challenges facing the European Union affecting millions of Europeans and carry substantial societal and economic costs. As Europe’s population ages, the prevalence and impact of neurological disease will continue to grow. Neurological disorders affect more than 41% of the global population, are the leading cause of disabilityadjusted life years (DALYs) in Europe and one of the top causes of death. The economic burden, including direct healthcare costs, long-term care, productivity losses, and informal caregiving, has recently been estimated to amount to €1.7 trillion annually within the EU, according to a soon to be published survey by the European Academy of Neurology. Europe’s demographic trajectory will amplify this pressure. Focusing on brain health during the Presidency allows Ireland to push for coordinated EU action in prevention, early detection, research funding, and health-system preparedness. Ireland has a positive narrative to share in terms of developing healthcare policy approaches to the management of neurological disease including clinical frameworks aimed at identifying and responding to these conditions at the earliest stages. Ireland’s growing strength as a hub for advanced neuroscience research positions it to drive innovation and highlight EU-level opportunities for scientific collaboration in this area. Prioritising brain health strongly aligns with several ongoing EU initiatives aimed at strengthening collective resilience against major health challenges, addressing long term care needs for ageing populations, boosting research and innovation and promoting data driven health solutions. Leadership in brain health also aligns with Irish priorities: supporting ageing populations, addressing rare disease, integrating care through Sláintecare reforms, and promoting innovative health technologies while implementing a human rights based approach to the needs of people with disabilities. The EU has endorsed the WHO’s Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy & Other Neurological Conditions and the Parliament is pressing the Commission for a dedicated EU brain strategy, in response to the calls of EU wide umbrella organisations including the European Federation of Neurological Associations, the European Brain Council and the European Academy of Neurology with strong support from Irish MEPS who are members of the MEP interest group on brain health and neurological conditions. Ireland has a unique opportunity to position itself as a leader in brain health, responding to the calls of its own citizen advocates at European and national level for greater action to address the needs of people living with neurological conditions while also availing of the opportunity to showcase the best of what our knowledge economy has to offer in mobilising innovative research and technology responses to one of Europe’s greatest healthcare challenges."

Ireland should use its Presidency to advance the call for an EU wide brain health strategy to link the commitment to implement the WHO Intersectoral Action Plan on Epilepsy and Other Neurological Conditions to EU policy and integrate research and other initiatives in this area across the EU. Ireland should also use its Presidency to support and advance the following key policy areas to develop and strengthen the EU wide response to neurological conditions By delivering on its commitments under the UNCRPD, Ireland can send a strong signal of its support for those living with neurological and other disabilities throughout the EU. Specifically, Ireland should prioritise the implementation of its National Neurorehabilitation Strategy to directly advance human rights goals for people with a neurological disability. Ireland should aim to show leadership by using the opportunity of the Presidency to launch a comprehensive and ambitious Life Sciences Strategy. A national life sciences strategy is needed for Ireland to drive innovation, attract investment, and create high-skilled jobs in a rapidly growing global sector. A comprehensive Life Sciences Strategy is critical to provide the funding, collaboration, infrastructure and regulation needed to position Ireland as a growing hub for neuroscience research across the EU. Ireland should aim to show leadership by prioritising its implementation of the European Health Data Space legislation to enhance patient care through secure and seamless access to health data across the EU. This legislation is critical to enable and support diagnosis, treatment and research in neurological conditions. Ireland remains the only country without a national Electronic Health Record limiting digital health adoption and data driven R & D. Ireland should aim to show leadership by prioritising the implementation of its Rare Disease Strategy launched in 2025, critical to ensuring equitable access to specialised services, genetic testing, and emerging therapies for rare neurological conditions and to support and develop Ireland’s research infrastructure as a growing hub for research and treatments for rare neurological disease. The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), in force since August 2024, recognises that AI has huge potential in the treatment of complex health conditions such as neurological conditions but only if implemented safely and ethically. Ireland should aim to show leadership in this area by implementing the findings of the 2025 IPPOSI Citizen Jury on AI in Healthcare including the creation of a statutory regulator to oversee AI use in healthcare in Ireland, the development of a 5 year strategy addressing workforce preparedness, ethical safeguards and integration of AI technologies, safeguarding of patient autonomy and data security, public engagement and dedicated funding. Implementing Ireland’s 2024 Strategy for Accelerating Genetic and Genomic Medicine in Ireland is critical for advancing brain health and in positioning Ireland as an EU leader in precision medicine."

Neurological conditions represent a major economic as well as an individual and societal issue across the EU. To address these challenges, an EU-wide action plan for neurological health is needed which would co-ordinate the EU response to these conditions across policy, research, healthcare delivery, and societal support. During its presidency of the EU Council in 2026, Ireland should aim to drive the agenda for brain health by prioritising neurological health as a thematic focus, organising dedicated Council working group meetings and stakeholder consultations to gather input from national health ministries, patient organisations, scientific experts, and industry representatives. These consultations would inform the scope and objectives of the action plan, ensuring it addresses key areas such as early diagnosis, access to care, research and innovation, workforce training, and public awareness. Ireland could also facilitate the drafting of a Council Recommendation on brain health, setting out shared EU-level objectives while respecting national competencies in healthcare delivery. This recommendation would provide a framework for member states to align policies, share best practices, and establish common indicators for monitoring progress. The Council, under Ireland’s presidency, could also task the European Commission with supporting implementation through funding programs, such as Horizon Europe for research initiatives, the European Social Fund for workforce development, and EU4Health for improving access to high-quality neurological care. Ireland’s presidency could ensure that multi-sectoral engagement is embedded in the action plan. This involves collaboration between public health authorities, healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, academic institutions, and industry partners. Such engagement would promote innovation in treatment, diagnostics, and digital health solutions, while fostering publicprivate partnerships that enhance access to therapies and improve care pathways across the EU. By prioritising brain health, the Council of Europe during Irelands presidency could take the first positive steps towards the development of a co-ordinated EU-wide action plan for neurological conditions which would have substantial benefits for people, businesses and communities across the EU. For individuals with neurological conditions and EU wide action plan would mobilise EU states to improve access to diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and long term supports for people with neurological conditions and their families. Communities would benefit from co-ordinated action at EU level to reduce inequalities in access to neurological care across the EU and promote greater inclusion and participation of EU citizens with neurological conditions. Businesses would benefit from policies aimed at supporting and enabling workforce participation for people with neurological conditions and family carers and developing and strengthening the growing position of the EU as a global leader in research and medical technology in brain health."

For people with neurological conditions and their families, the focus on neurological health sends a message of recognition and validation. It acknowledges the social, economic, and emotional challenges they face while promoting inclusion, accessibility, and support. It also sends a message to communities across the EU to reduce stigma and enhance public understanding and recognition of neurological conditions. Research by the European Federation of Neurological Associations highlights the impact of a neurological diagnosis on the health, social participation and employment of Eu citizens. According to the 2022 EFNA survey with over 1000 respondents from 30 countries across Europe, only one in five of those living with a neurological condition have access to affordable treatments that satisfactorily manage their condition. 84% said they experienced stigma or discrimination in areas including employment, education and obtaining insurance or mortgage cover while condition specific research points to lower levels of workforce participation and a high percentage of people with neurological conditions leaving the workplace due to their condition. These findings are echoed here in Ireland, with the over 860 respondents to the 2024 Neurological Alliance of Ireland Patient Experience Survey highlighting significant deficits in access to diagnosis, specialist care and rehabilitation and the impact of their neurological condition on mental health, employment and financial wellbeing. The growing burden of neurological conditions represents a huge challenge for healthcare systems, economies and societies across the EU. Member states, and Ireland in particular, are however increasingly mobilising their healthcare and life sciences sector towards a greater focus on neurological health with the potential to position the EU as a world leader in this area. By adopting brain health as a key priority, Ireland can achieve tangible benefits from its Presidency to leave a lasting legacy in an emerging priority area for health, economic and social policy across the EU."

Neurological conditions are among the leading causes of disability across Europe, and EU-level momentum on brain health is growing rapidly. By placing neurological health at the centre of its Presidency agenda, Ireland can help shape a coordinated European response that strengthens prevention, early diagnosis, treatment pathways, and long-term supports for millions of its citizens. The Neurological Alliance of Ireland (NAI), with its membership of 39 neurological patient organisations, offers Government a strong, experienced partner with deep connections across Europe. NAI works in partnership with EU-level umbrellas representing neurological and brain health organisations, all of whom play a central role in advancing the EU agenda through their stewardship of the MEP Interest Group on Neurological Conditions and Brain Health. These partnerships provide Ireland with immediate access to expertise, networks, and advocacy capacity to focus on the brain health agenda during Ireland’s Presidency. Focusing on brain health also aligns strategically with Ireland’s strengths. It showcases Ireland as a leader in healthcare research and innovation, supporting growth in neuroscience, digital health, medical technologies, and patient-centred innovation. Prioritising brain health would therefore deliver both societal impact and economic opportunity while reinforcing Ireland’s reputation as a forward-looking, research-driven EU member state. Ireland’s neurological community is exceptionally strong, dynamic, and innovative, characterised by a depth of expertise and collaboration that positions the country as a leader in neurological care, research, and advocacy. At its core is a highly skilled cohort of specialists many of whom have trained and worked in leading institutions across Europe, North America, and beyond. This international experience enriches Irish clinical practice with global standards and cutting-edge insights, fostering a culture of excellence that benefits patients and fuels research. Complementing this clinical strength is Ireland’s growing reputation in neuroscience research, anchored by internationally recognised investigators and research centres driving advances in areas such as neurodegeneration, brain injury and rare neurological diseases. Vital to the strength of Ireland’s neurological community is its vibrant and proactive patient advocacy sector. Irish neurological patient organisations are highly engaged, informed, and influential, playing a central role in shaping national policy, research priorities, and service improvement. Their presence is strongly felt at European level as well, where Irish advocates contribute to key platforms and advisory groups, ensuring that the perspectives and needs of people living with neurological conditions in Ireland are represented in broader European initiatives. This active participation underscores the maturity and credibility of Ireland’s patient voice, which is recognised as an essential partner in the development of effective neurological strategies. At the centre of this community is the Neurological Alliance of Ireland (NAI) and its member organisations, uniquely positioned to bring together clinicians, researchers, industry leaders, and patient organisations to mobilise Ireland’s action during the Presidency to prioritise brain health as a strategic pillar of public health policy across Europe."

As an island nation with a strong rural base and significant off-grid energy demand, Ireland is well placed to champion an approach to EU energy, transport and climate policy that is both ambitious and grounded in the realities facing households, businesses and communities across Europe. DCC recommends that Ireland focuses its Presidency around the following overarching themes: A fair, inclusive and technology-neutral energy transition Ireland should lead efforts to ensure that EU decarbonisation policy is centred on emissions outcomes rather than technology mandates. A technology-neutral, market-based approach, which allows renewable liquids, renewable gases and electrification to compete on equal terms is essential for delivering the most efficient and cost-effective pathways to net zero. Ensuring fairness also means recognising the needs of rural, off-grid and hard-to-electrify communities, where high retrofit costs or system replacements are not feasible in the short term. Renewable drop-in fuels such as HVO, BioLPG and biomethane can provide immediate emissions reductions using existing infrastructure, supporting a practical and inclusive transition, while supporting countries achieve their Effort Sharing Regulation targets. Ireland’s experience in developing the Renewable Heat Obligation positions it well to contribute to EU discussions on how renewable heat can be scaled in a flexible and consumer-focused way. Strengthening Europe's energy security and resilience Recent years have underscored the importance of resilient, diversified and domestically sourced energy. Ireland should champion the role of EU produced biomethane and renewable gases in strengthening Europe’s energy security, particularly for peak demand, rural industries and sectors reliant on process heat. These fuels reduce dependence on imported fossil energy and support an orderly, secure transition. Boosting industrial competitiveness and innovation By elevating renewable gases and renewable liquid fuels within Europe’s broader industrial strategy, Ireland can help support EU value chains, manufacturing and innovation. A supportive policy framework will unlock investment in sustainable fuels production, storage, logistics and distribution - creating skilled employment and enhancing Europe’s long-term competitiveness. Ensuring cohesion and a just transition across all regions Finally, Ireland should embed rural cohesion across all Presidency priorities. The transition must work for all communities, including islands, remote regions and off-grid households. Policies that provide choice, flexibility and affordability are essential to ensuring that no region is left behind. Together, these themes position Ireland to drive a Presidency that is ambitious, equitable and grounded in real world solutions - delivering meaningful progress for Europe’s climate, energy security and economic resilience."
110,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/f30bc3d1/DCC_plc_-_Submission_110.docx,DCC plc,,,,2,"Ireland’s Presidency comes at a pivotal moment for the EU’s climate and energy agenda, with several major legislative files entering negotiation or revision. At the same time, EU countries are not meeting their emissions reduction targets such as those in the Effort Sharing Regulation with foreseen measures having little impact on these. Therefore, the Presidency can add significant value by ensuring that policies relevant to heating, renewable fuels and energy security are advanced so that they deliver on EU policy objectives. Heating & Cooling Strategy and Electrification Action Plan A central priority should be ensuring that the Heating and Cooling Strategy is properly implemented and quickly delivers on reducing emissions. Upcoming policies focused on electrification will not deliver sufficient reductions by 2030, so renewable fuels must be deployed wherever needed. Heating and cooling account for half of the EU’s energy use, and legislative measures flowing from the strategy must reflect the realities faced by consumers in both urban and rural areas. Ireland should seek strong Council Conclusions reaffirming Member States’ commitment to a technology-neutral approach to increasing renewable energy and reducing GHG emissions in heating, sending a clear signal that all viable renewable solutions have a legitimate role in the transition. Ireland should work to secure a policy framework that: Recognises the contribution of renewable liquid and gaseous fuels, alongside heat pumps, district heating and energy efficiency, within a technology-neutral approach. Addresses the needs of off-grid households, rural regions and industrial sites. Establishes a practical, sector-specific pathway that reflects Europe’s diverse building stock and infrastructure. The Presidency should support progress toward an EU-wide renewable heat obligation in RED, modelled on Ireland’s RHO. A harmonised obligation, with ambitious but realistic, gradually increasing targets, would drive investment while giving Member States flexibility in how they deliver outcomes. Energy Union Package: Renewable Energy Frameworks The Renewable Energy Directive sets ambitious targets. Renewable liquid and gaseous fuels, such as HVO, BioLPG, rDME and biomethane, can make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the legislation, provided they meet the sustainability standards. These include strict GHG emissions- saving thresholds of 65–80% depending on the sector, and comprehensive rules on feedstock sustainability, land-use change and biodiversity protection. However, while such targets have helped stimulate renewables in easier-to-decarbonise sectors, they have not been sufficient to drive progress in heating, where structural and cost barriers persist. Additional clarity and flexibility are needed to ensure that heating contributes effectively to the EU’s decarbonisation effort. Ireland’s Presidency can support refinement of the renewable energy framework in a way that remains technology-neutral, affordable and inclusive of all viable renewable fuels. Delivering a practical and inclusive policy landscape By advancing these files with a strong focus on technology neutrality, practical delivery and rural inclusion, Ireland’s Presidency can help shape a policy framework that accelerates decarbonisation while remaining realistic, flexible and affordable. Clear, consistent rules and recognition of a broad suite of renewable technologies will support investment, strengthen energy security and enable communities across the Union to participate fully in the transition."

By emphasising real-world implementation and the diverse needs of EU regions, Ireland can help shape Council outcomes that accelerate climate action while supporting societal cohesion and economic resilience. Supporting an inclusive transition for all communities A substantial share of Europe’s population, including 137 million people living in rural areas and millions of off-gas-grid households and businesses, faces different realities and higher barriers to clean heating than urban consumers. Many live in older buildings or operate as SMEs where deep retrofits or full electrification are technically difficult or financially out of reach. The Council can help ensure that EU policy recognises this diversity by enabling a wider set of decarbonisation pathways, including renewable drop-in fuels such as HVO, BioLPG and renewable DME, which reduce emissions quickly and with minimal disruption. Reducing costs and disruption for households and businesses Cost remains one of the biggest obstacles to the transition. In many regions, heat pump installation and associated fabric upgrades can cost €30,000-€50,000, putting them out of reach for many households. By contrast, renewable liquid and gaseous fuels can be adopted with minimal up-front investment while delivering substantial emissions reductions. The Council can support people and small businesses by encouraging Member States to prioritise low-cost, low-disruption decarbonisation measures, reducing energy poverty risks and keeping the transition fair. Strengthening Europe’s energy security Recent energy crises have shown the need for diversified, resilient and domestically sourced energy. The Council can emphasise the contribution of EU-produced biomethane and renewable liquid gases to reducing fossil fuel imports, stabilising supply, and ensuring reliable energy for rural communities and industry. These solutions enhance security while supporting local economies. Upholding high sustainability standards As Europe scales up renewable fuels and heating solutions, maintaining robust sustainability criteria is essential. Renewable liquids and gases already meet strict EU thresholds for emissions savings, feedstock sourcing and biodiversity protection. The Council can reinforce the importance of credible, verifiable sustainability rules so that communities and consumers can trust that the energy they use genuinely contributes to Europe’s climate goals. Providing predictable, technology-neutral policy to drive innovation Consumers and businesses benefit when EU policy is stable, technology-neutral and focused on outcomes. The Council can support a framework that allows electrification, renewable liquids, renewable gases and hybrid systems to compete on equal terms. Such clarity will unlock investment in renewable heat, biomethane and energy services, supporting innovation and economic resilience across the EU.

Clear, grounded communication, rooted in relatable stories and inclusive dialogue, will be key to ensuring citizens feel connected to the Presidency and to the wider European project. Demonstrating real-world benefits through local projects The most effective way to make EU action tangible is to showcase real examples of how European frameworks support climate, economic and social progress. The Presidency can highlight Ireland’s growing biomethane sector, off-grid households successfully transitioning to HVO or BioLPG, and SMEs reducing emissions through renewable fuels. These stories show that EU climate policy is not abstract - it is enabling cleaner, more affordable and more resilient energy solutions in everyday settings. Public-private partnerships should also feature prominently. Investments such as DCC’s biomethane development with Flogas and Neiphin Energy illustrate how EU-aligned policies mobilise private capital, support farm incomes and stimulate regional job creation. Spotlighting these collaborations reinforces the message that the EU, Member States and businesses are working together to deliver real outcomes. Engaging companies, farming organisations, community groups and social partners as messengers will help ensure the Presidency’s communication resonates across diverse audiences and reflects trusted local voices. Communicating a fair, flexible and inclusive transition A central message for the Presidency should be that the EU’s energy transition is designed to be inclusive and flexible, not prescriptive. Citizens should understand that the EU supports multiple decarbonisation pathways allowing households and businesses to choose the solutions that best match their buildings, budgets and infrastructure. This approach is particularly important for rural, island and off-gas-grid communities. Discussing practical decarbonisation options shows that EU policy recognises regional diversity and supports a just transition where no area is left behind. Connecting climate action to energy security and local economic value Communications should also emphasise that EU climate action strengthens Europe’s security and economic resilience. Investments in domestic biomethane and renewable liquid gases reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, keep more economic activity within local economies and support strategic autonomy. Framing climate measures as contributing to both sustainability and sovereignty will help broaden public support and highlight the wider benefits of EU cooperation."

To bolster competitiveness in this new context, Europe must think in systems: open markets, secure supply chains, adaptive regulation, and an innovation ecosystem that can withstand shocks while driving growth. This will determine our ability to grow and prosper, trade internationally and attract investment, provide job opportunities and raise living standards. Resilience has become the defining capability of Europe’s future prosperity. It is no longer a theme beside competitiveness or sustainability but a system that connects and strengthens them. Resilience is how Europe anticipates disruption, adapts to change, and sustains open, competitive economies in a more uncertain world. Energy, digital, skills, innovation, and security and defence are core pillars of this resilience. During Ireland’s EU Presidency, Ibec will champion a European approach that makes resilience the foundation of competitiveness, an outward-looking, confident, and investment-ready Europe that delivers stability and opportunity for business and citizens alike. Ibec recognises the leadership opportunity of the Presidency to influence the direction of EU policy on everything from regulatory simplification and advancing the Single Market, to decarbonisation and sustainability, leading on digital and AI transformation, furthering trade and investment, and countering protectionism. Dealing with geopolitical uncertainty, EU enlargement and supporting Ukraine requires a coherent resilience agenda and securing agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2028- 2034 to support competitiveness in the years ahead. Irish business wants to play a central role in collaboration with Government to ensure the Presidency’s success. The vision of Irish business for a successful EU Presidency is one that drives forward an EU that is more competitive, resilient, innovative, simplified, focused, ambitious and outward looking, grounded in resilience.

We ask that Ireland ensures Travellers are identified within those themes as a group most impacted by intergenerational inequity, poverty and child specific poor outcomes. And that Ireland recommits to Traveller children during the EU Presidency and in dialogue at the Commission on the EU Child Guarantee. The EU/ Ireland Child Guarantee. • Poverty: Advocacy for targeted measures to reduce child poverty through a Child Income Support Payment (CISP) and an increase to core social welfare rates by a minimum of €27.50 did not culminate in the current or previous Budgets. • Despite National Measures and Targets defined in the Roadmap for Social Inclusion RSI to address poverty reduction, there are no Traveller specific targeted approaches or evidenced based assessments to frame policy making. • The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy NTRIS was named as corelating to the RSI Strategy, but poverty reduction is not a thematic goal of the NTRIS and its Traveller employment focus was limited • Baseline assessment methods to drive the change and protective measures enshrined under the Guarantee for Traveller children in Ireland as described therein, is not aligned and integrated foundationally and specific research is needed to achieve those intended objectives. In housing and accommodation 1,556 Traveller families (over 6,000 people) are living in unsafe, inadequate conditions in unauthorised sites or sharing housing and over half are under 24 years. In 2024 1,044 Traveller applicants qualified for social housing support, two thirds couples or singles with children, and a half overall was couples with 1–3 children. Just 96 new units were built for Travellers nationally of 774 overall (TAP 2019-2024) and from an original target of 3,060 units and delivery rates grossly at odds with the rate of supply of other housing forms. The age profile (young)and housing type status of Travellers is not being factored into housing and accommodation strategies and plans at national or local points, of the very specific cultural dynamic features of early marriage and childbirth. This exacerbates the need for housing support and causes undue burden on families to live in grossly inadequate and overcrowded conditions.

We raised the importance of sustaining open and vibrant democracies, being codependent on civic society partners who play a fundamental role in upholding the democratic foundations of the EU, and the importance of holding policymakers to account, monitoring and advocating for human rights, ensuring citizens’ voices are represented in policymaking, especially Travellers who are typically excluded.

The Omnibus I process and the resulting gutting of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) was a clear show of deregulation. The competitiveness agenda has been used to prioritise business interests over basic protections for workers, human rights defenders and communities affected by corporate abuse who are now likely to face insurmountable barriers to access justice for harms caused by companies headquartered or operating in the EU. This approach undermines the EU’s credibility and the core values it claims to uphold. The Irish Presidency must work to ensure that EU’s strategic agenda commitment to “respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities” does not continue to be breached. We strongly encourage that a key priority thematic and operational priority is support for civil society including environmental activists and groups in Ireland. Friends of the Earth is a member of the Environmental Pillar which met with Minister Byrne in November. We very much welcomed his commitment to championing the role of civil society across Europe, and his dismissal of some anti-civil society tropes. Civil society space is under attack in various places around Europe, both geographic and ideological, and we strongly support that Ireland should uphold the long tradition of positive engagement with civil society before and during the Irish presidency of the EU. Ireland must not shy away from the growing problem of corporate capture in EU policymaking. The process for Omnibus I has shown how disproportionate industry influence can distort policy outcomes, marginalise affected communities and prevent them from accessing justice and undermine public trust. A true democracy requires strong, independent civil society organisations that can advocate for human rights and environmental protection without undue pressure or exclusion. Ireland must ensure transparent and balanced stakeholder engagement processes across all files, and champion initiatives that safeguard the role of civil society and human rights defenders within the EU. The backlash against the CSDDD and other Green Deal files exposed a growing disconnect between EU institutions and the public, fuelled by undue corporate influence, opaque negotiations, last-minute political deals and alignment with far-right parties in breach of the longstanding “cordon sanitaire” in place for the protection of democratic norms. Ireland should advocate for transparent, democratic legislative processes, better access to information, and robust oversight of Council decision-making. Greater transparency and meaningful engagement with impacted stakeholders will help restore trust, ensure evidencebased policymaking, and reaffirm the EU’s commitment to its founding principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The Environmental Pillar has also proposed the theme of Resilience as a timely and resonant theme, capturing as it does the need for the Union to support people’s inherent ability to cope with the increasing uncertainty and volatility by strengthening our institutions and infrastructure to match the spirit of community Europe’s citizens demonstrate so often. The fact that the EU’s Strategic Foresight report, the European Environmental Agency’s latest flagship report and NextGenerationEU all centre resilience in their framing of the challenges ahead gives Ireland robust foundations to build on."

Ireland and the EU must demand a full phase-out of fossil fuels without caveats such as “unabated” fossil fuel or defining gas as a “transition fuel,” and avoid reliance on costly and unproven CCUS technologies. They should champion differentiated global phase-out timelines based on equity and CBDR-RC principles, scale up finance, technology, and capacity support for developing countries, and clearly delineate fossil fuel phase-out trajectories. Ireland and the EU must also exclude participants with vested industry interests in delegations. Ireland and the EU should also lead in safeguarding human rights and enabling meaningful participation of civil society and frontline communities. The EU Council’s recent agreement on a 2040 climate target includes a heavy emphasis on flexibilities, which raises significant concerns. The use of carbon credits, a biennial review that risks creating a shifting “ranged” target, sectoral flexibilities that allow reduced effort, and the option to lower the 2040 goal if land-use underperforms threaten to weaken EU climate ambition by diverting resources from domestic action, undermining investment certainty, and removing incentives for genuine emissions reductions. As trilogue negotiations with Parliament begin, it is important to ensure that this deregulatory trend does not become embedded or replicated in future EU climate legislation. Although the Council’s position cannot now be reopened, the Commission will soon start preparing revisions to the sectoral policies needed to achieve the newly adopted 2040 target, expected in Q3/Q4 next year, and it is crucial that the Irish Presidency does not all for any further dilution of ambition. The text in the recent Council agreement on the 2040 target also acknowledges the particular characteristics of agriculture, but it does not explicitly endorse changing methane emissions metrics. Reports that parts of the Irish Government pushed for special treatment through alternative methane metrics are deeply concerning, as this would weaken accountability, hinder climate action, and contradict scientific consensus. By focusing political effort on securing exemptions rather than advancing real emissions reductions, Ireland risks serious reputational damage and a return to its past status as a climate laggard. We strongly urge Government not to accept or repeat this approach. Ireland must ensure that its 2026 Presidency prioritises legislative areas where strong human rights, environmental protections, and democratic governance are most at risk. Ireland must prioritise the completion and effective implementation of key Green Deal files that remain vulnerable to political dilution or delay. This includes defending climate, biodiversity, and environmental legislation that has come under pressure from deregulatory agendas. Ireland must ensure that no future Omnibus initiatives repeat the untransparent, undemocratic deregulatory approach taken by the institutions. The Presidency must promote transparent, standalone legislative processes, proper impact assessments, and meaningful consultation with affected stakeholders—including workers, communities, and civil society organisations."

We would welcome the opportunity to facilitate such meetings together with other eNGOs. Council agendas and informal meetings should prioritise implementation challenges, funding gaps and delivery capacity under existing EU climate and energy legislation, rather than reopening recently agreed laws. This includes sharing best practices between Member States on energy poverty reduction, building renovation, and renewable deployment. Recent years have seen growing public concern about opaque processes, last-minute amendments, and undue corporate influence. The European Ombudsman also decided that the Commission’s undemocratic environmental rollbacks through Omnibus I amounted to “maladministration”. Enhancing transparency, meaningfully engaging with rightsholders, improving access to documents, and clearly communicating Member State positions would help improve democratic legitimacy and public engagement. The Presidency must play a central role in safeguarding the remaining elements of the European Green Deal, strengthening protections against corporate abuse, and rebuilding trust in EU institutions through accountability and transparency. The Irish Presidency can make the greatest positive impact by ensuring that EU policymaking centres on people, communities, environmental protection and climate action rather than prioritising business and growth in all aspects of its policymaking. This requires strengthening rights protections, engaging with rightsholders, safeguarding democratic processes, and ensuring that laws already in place deliver meaningful outcomes. A rights-centred Council agenda will help ensure that EU law offers protection for individuals negatively impacted by the activities of corporate actors."

EU communication should be: -Develop a range of value lead statements focusing the role of values of rights under attack - minority rights, civil society, digital rights and not least environmental rights -Center people’s voices -workers, families, young people, communities. Ireland should facilitate: -Local forums / town halls where people can speak directly into EU priorities. -Community-led conversations supported by civil society. -Engagements that reach groups typically excluded from national-level dialogue. Ireland must correct the narrative around “competitiveness” and “simplification” and ensure that business interests do not continue to be prioritised over essential protections for workers, communities and the environment. These terms are increasingly being misused to justify lowering protections rather than strengthening long-term resilience, responsible business conduct, and a sustainable, fair economy. The Environmental Pillar welcomed Minister Bryne’s openness to reflecting the position of Northern Ireland as subject to EU law during Ireland’s EU Presidency. We understand the jurisdictional constraints on the location of official events but we would encourage DFA to explore the option of inviting relevant stakeholders from the North to participate in Presidency events as appropriate. As noted, Ireland must strongly reject the deliberate misleading simplification (i.e. deregulation) approach which serves to undermine, rather than promote, EU law among citizens. The Commission is currently on a drive to “simplify” EU regulation, including very recently adopted measures that form part of the European Green Deal. While seeking to ensure regulation achieves its objectives efficiently is theoretically uncontroversial, in practice the process so far has been accompanied by a strong deregulation push that clearly risks undermining standards and outcomes for EU citizens and the environment. Some companies, industry alliances and their well-paid lobbyists (especially fossil fuel companies, big tech and chemical companies) are using this political pivot from the Commission to seek wholescale deregulation (in a “shock doctrine” style manipulation of current geopolitical and geo-economic turbulence), However, many experts, institutions and agencies, including the ECB for example, are warning that this not in fact good for business as a whole, who benefit from regulatory certainty, and is essentially punishing those businesses that have invested in transition, is rewarding laggards and undermines the EU’s transition to long-term sustainability and prosperity Ireland has a responsibility to ensure that future Omnibus processes do not follow this same deregulatory approach. Ireland must prioritise rights-centred policymaking, ensure meaningful consultation with impacted stakeholders throughout all stages of the lawmaking process, including workers, communities, human rights defenders, and environmental organisations, and protect what remains of the Green Deal. Ireland must champion rights-centred policymaking and insist that these consultations are substantive and transparent. It is essential that Ireland support the full implementation of the European Green Deal and resist attempts to weaken existing environmental and human rights standards under the guise of “simplification.”  We would have grave concerns regarding any re-opening of the Energy Efficiency Directive requirements including energy saving requirements. Given the Commission’s 2026 Work Programme signals an upcoming examination and potential updating of the EU energy efficiency framework, the Irish Presidency should work to ensure that any future review does not weaken the robust binding elements of the 2023 Energy Efficiency Directive, which are vital to reducing energy demand and fossil fuel dependence, and should prioritise delivery and enforcement over rolling-back ambition."

The Council expressed strong concern over Ireland’s slow transposition, noting it is “extremely disappointed and deeply concerned that transposition and other important deadlines are being missed.” In particular, delays relate to transposition of the Renewable Energy Directive, the Energy Efficiency Directive, and the requirement to submit a social climate plan by June 2025, which is crucial for addressing energy poverty and supporting vulnerable households. [https://www.climatecouncil.ie/councilpublications/annualreviewandreport/CCAC-AR2025-Crosssectoral-final.pdf ] Ireland’s Presidency should promote a clear EU-wide pathway to halving energy demand and delivering a fully zero-carbon energy system, by driving ambition beyond minimum requirements under existing energy efficiency and renewable energy legislation, accelerating fossil fuel phaseout. We have particular concerns that the Government’s approval of a state-owned LNG terminal and continued facilitation of the Shannon LNG project will be progressed during the Irish Presidency notwithstanding Ireland’s national and EU climate obligations . The risk of reputational damage to Ireland should not be underestimated in this regard. With National Building Renovation Plans being finalised during Ireland’s Presidency at the end for 2026, the Council focus should prioritise ambitious and socially just delivery in the built environment. This includes promoting “worst-first” deep renovations, the phase-out of fossil fuels in buildings, and the integration of renewable heating and cooling, while ensuring strong social safeguards to protect affordability and prevent displacement. Empowering local authorities and aligning EU funding instruments, including the Social Climate Fund, will be essential to translating EU climate and energy law into warmer homes, lower energy bills and quality jobs. The Irish Presidency must ensure that EU climate and energy law negotiations reflect the recent ICJ Advisory Opinion, which affirms that the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal should guide climate action based on the best available science, considering states’ historical responsibilities and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The Opinion also emphasizes that state obligations extend beyond climate law to human rights, environmental, and customary international law, with breaches potentially triggering liability for restitution, compensation, or ecosystem restoration. It also notes that a state can be held internationally accountable for failing to regulate or limit emissions from private actors under its jurisdiction, including through fossil fuel production, consumption, licensing, or subsidies."

Serious allergies and anaphylaxis are rising across Europe and place a growing burden on individuals, schools, workplaces, and public services. Addressing them fits naturally within broader objectives to protect citizens’ wellbeing and reduce preventable health risks. A Resilient and Prepared Europe The EU must be equipped to respond to emergencies—whether acute health events, natural disasters, or public safety threats. This requires harmonised emergency response systems, stronger communitylevel preparedness, and cross-border cooperation. Ireland is one of the few Member States that has taken concrete steps to improve preparedness for serious allergic reactions, including allowing pharmacists to supply emergency medicines without a prescription during anaphylactic events. This national practice demonstrates effective emergency readiness and provides a model for EU-level policy coordination, which could inform upcoming initiatives under the European Health Union framework aimed at strengthening preparedness, prevention, and rapid response across Member States. A People-Centred Union that Protects Embedding people-centred principles into EU policymaking ensures that vulnerable populations and individuals at risk of medical emergencies are not left behind. The Presidency could advance reducing health inequalities across the EU, highlighting uneven access to diagnosis, specialist care, and emergency response protocols. Positioning timely care for serious allergies and anaphylaxis within this agenda demonstrates a commitment to practical, measurable improvements in patient safety and inclusion, while protecting citizens’ rights to safety in everyday environments such as schools, childcare centres, workplaces, and public venues. 3.

Reducing Health Inequalities and Strengthening Citizen Rights The Presidency could advance equitable access to emergency care and citizen-centred policy: Link preparedness to strengthening the Child Guarantee (non-legislative, Q2 2026) and Citizens omnibus (legislative, Q4 2026), ensuring children in schools, childcare centres, and communities are protected and have their rights effectively enforced. Promote intergenerational fairness through the Intergenerational fairness strategy (nonlegislative, Q1 2026), ensuring emergency preparedness and health access benefit current and future generations equally. Highlight Ireland’s model as a practical, replicable approach for other Member States. Objectives Establish a model for EU-level anaphylaxis and emergency response coordination, based on best practices of Ireland. Ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments across the EU. Promote digital innovation for preparedness, information sharing, and cross-border patient care. Strengthen citizen rights and intergenerational fairness, ensuring public health policies reflect social equity. Position health resilience as a pillar of EU citizen safety and social cohesion, demonstrating tangible improvements in public health readiness. By focusing on these targeted initiatives, Ireland can use its Presidency to deliver practical, measurable impacts on citizen safety, health equity, and cross-border emergency preparedness while reinforcing the EU’s social and legal frameworks."

For individuals with serious allergies, policies that improve emergency response, access to medicines, and accurate allergen information can be life-saving. For people, expanded access to emergency treatment, including pharmacy-enabled emergency supply across the EU, enhances safety in daily life. Citizens with serious allergies would be better protected in schools, workplaces, sports facilities, cultural venues, and during cross-border travel. For businesses, harmonised allergen-labelling and staff-training expectations reduce regulatory uncertainty, simplify compliance, and improve consumer trust by fostering safer public environments. For communities and institutions, EU-supported readiness measures ,such as common school protocols, public-venue guidelines, and accessible training ,would significantly reduce preventable emergencies, supporting all three Alliance objectives.

The 2026 Presidency can show how EU cooperation protects people, strengthens communities, and makes daily life safer—particularly in areas such as emergency preparedness for serious allergies and anaphylaxis. Highlight Practical Examples of EU Solidarity Citizens understand the EU best when they see clear, relatable outcomes. Ireland can communicate EU values by highlighting how cooperation improves safety and wellbeing, for example: Safer environments in schools, restaurants, transport and public venues. Shared health information that makes travel within the EU safer and more predictable. Harmonised allergen-labelling rules that protect consumers wherever they are. More consistent access to emergency support for serious allergic reactions. Ireland’s own approach—allowing pharmacists to supply emergency treatment during a serious allergic reaction—provides a concrete example of national leadership that improves citizen safety. Propose Council Recommendations on Emergency Readiness To strengthen public understanding of the EU’s benefits, Ireland could lead on a visible, citizen-centred initiative: Develop Council Recommendations on broader readiness and access to emergency treatment for serious allergy and anaphylaxis. This would help encourage Member States to: Improve preparedness in schools, public venues, workplaces, and transport hubs. Ensure trained responders are available across community settings. Reduce inequalities in access to time-sensitive, life-saving care. Such an initiative is easy for citizens to relate to, directly improves safety, and demonstrates EU cooperation in a human, practical way. A simple message: the EU protects people By showcasing initiatives that make everyday life safer, including better emergency preparedness for serious allergic reactions, the Irish Presidency can reinforce a clear message: EU cooperation delivers real, practical benefits for families, children, workers, and communities. This people-centred framing will strengthen public trust, build ownership, and demonstrate the concrete value of Ireland’s leadership at EU level."

290,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a3f002f/FoodCloud_-_Submission_290.docx,FoodCloud,,,,1,"FoodCloud recommends that Ireland prioritise climate action and social cohesion during its Presidency of the EU Council with food security as the central cross-cutting theme. At a time when global commitment to shared values, democracy, equality and human rights is weakening globally, Ireland has an opportunity to champion the EU’s collective ambition for a resilient, inclusive and sustainable future. Food security is critical to achieving the EU Strategic Agenda, supporting a democratic, secure, prosperous and competitive Europe. As former President Michael D. Higgins stated, responding to global hunger and vindicating the right to food are among the most urgent contemporary challenges. The UN WFP’s Global Report on Food Crises identifies climate-related weather extremes as the second-largest driver of acute food insecurity, affecting over 96 million people. Addressing food systems stability and food security is fundamental to both climate action and social cohesion. Ireland is well placed to lead this agenda. With approximately 80% of Ireland’s food imported, the country is acutely exposed to external shocks. Yet Ireland is also recognised as a leader in sustainable food systems. Strengthening domestic horticultural production, reducing waste and building circular food systems will not only enhance Ireland’s food sovereignty but also contribute to EU-wide goals of resilience, sustainability and competitiveness. Reducing food waste globally and increasing food sovereignty are also essential to progress on the SDGs (especially SDG 12.3 and 2) and Agenda 2030. To advance these aims, Ireland should champion the following priority areas across the EU work programme: 1. Building circular and resilient food systems Ireland should lead efforts to promote circularity, ensuring edible surplus food is redistributed first for human consumption in line with the food waste hierarchy. Ireland can push for ambitious measures, enhanced reporting, and dedicated support for redistribution infrastructure and digital innovation. Strengthening domestic, diversified and climate-resilient production Ireland should support climate-resilient production systems including targeted support for horticulture, supporting sustainable diversification options for farmers and promoting agricultural recovery schemes that improve returns for small and medium producers, thereby enhancing farm incomes. These initiatives contribute to rural development, climate adaptation and long-term food availability. Enhancing community resilience and social cohesion Ireland should advocate for continued and robust ESF+ food support funding in the next Multiannual Financial Framework. ESF+ food support is essential for tackling poverty and reducing food insecurity and supporting vulnerable households, thereby reinforcing the EU’s broader goals of community resilience and social cohesion. Driving global leadership through ODA Ireland should continue to champion overseas development assistance as a means of promoting security and stability. Ireland can explore how technological advancements can empower developing nations to become more independent and resilient. For example, Irish Aid has funded FoodCloud’s virtual food-banking project in Africa. This enables food banks there to facilitate efficient redistribution without central warehouses. Since November 2023, FoodCloud’s technology has enabled the sharing of over 5.6 million meals in Kenya, demonstrating the transformative potential of digital redistribution in strengthening communities and reducing waste. By prioritising climate action and social cohesion through the lens of food security, Ireland can help steer the EU towards a more resilient and inclusive future, supporting communities at home, strengthening strategic autonomy across Europe and contributing to global food security."
290,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a3f002f/FoodCloud_-_Submission_290.docx,FoodCloud,,,,2,"As an organisation dedicated to reducing food waste and strengthening community resilience through food redistribution, FoodCloud recommends that Ireland’s 2026 Presidency prioritise policy areas that enable maximisation of food resources. Food redistribution can directly advance the EU Strategic Agenda’s goals on climate action, social cohesion, competitiveness, and strategic resilience. The Presidency offers a critical opportunity to highlight the importance of following the food use and waste hierarchy and to champion practical, socially beneficial solutions that reduce emissions, support vulnerable communities, and improve food security. 1. Waste Framework Directive (WFD) Work on the revised WFD, including implementing acts and monitoring frameworks, will continue through 2026. Ireland should prioritise advancing Council progress on binding food waste reduction targets across manufacturing, processing, retail, food service, and household sectors. The Presidency should champion strong donation and redistribution provisions to ensure surplus food is directed to feed people wherever possible, fully aligned with the food waste hierarchy. Strengthening measurement, accountability, and reporting systems will be essential for all Member States to meet these targets. Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP) The next CEAP is expected to evolve during the Irish Presidency. Ireland should ensure that food waste reduction and redistribution are clearly embedded as priority areas within the Plan. Redistribution not only prevents unnecessary waste and reduces the emissions embedded in food production but also delivers immediate social impact by supporting communities. Ireland can use the Presidency to promote innovative models of redistribution and strengthen resource efficiency measures that contribute to the EU’s competitiveness and resilience. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) With FoodCloud appointed as an SDG Champion for 2026–27, we strongly support integrating SDGs across EU policymaking. Ireland should ensure that SDG 12.3, halving food waste by 2030, is reflected in relevant Council conclusions and discussions. Promoting harmonised reporting and monitoring approaches linked to SDG targets will improve transparency and help Member States progress towards 2030 commitments. International Climate Leadership and COP 31 Ahead of COP 31 in Turkey, Ireland can help shape a strong, unified EU position. The Presidency should encourage the inclusion of food loss and waste reduction - and the associated saving of wasted emissions in Nationally Determined Contributions, strengthen momentum behind Axis 3 of the COP 30 Action Agenda on food loss and waste, and promote EU support for the Declaration on Reducing Methane from Organic Waste and the No Organic Waste Initiative. Ireland should champion the commitments made by signatories, including Ireland, to the COP28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems, and Climate Action. Leadership in these areas will reinforce the EU’s global climate credibility. Social Cohesion and ESF+ While defence and security considerations will shape MFF negotiations, it is vital that social cohesion remains protected. Ireland should advocate for continued ring-fenced support for ESF+ food support programmes. Reductions in this area would disproportionately affect vulnerable households and undermine broader EU objectives of stability, fairness, and resilience. Conclusion By prioritising these areas, Ireland’s Presidency can drive meaningful progress on food waste reduction and redistribution, delivering climate benefits, improving food security, and strengthening community resilience across the EU."
290,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a3f002f/FoodCloud_-_Submission_290.docx,FoodCloud,,,,3,"Europe is entering a period of significant uncertainty, with long-established economic and geopolitical assumptions now under pressure. As the European Commission’s 2026 work programme highlights, the EU must respond to this “independence moment” by strengthening stability, competitiveness, and strategic resilience. The Irish Presidency has a critical opportunity to contribute to these objectives by advancing practical, people-centred initiatives that make Europe’s food system more circular, more efficient, and more secure. A focus on food waste reduction and food redistribution, aligned with the priorities outlined in Question 2, offers one of the most immediate and substantial positive impacts for people, businesses, and communities across the EU. These issues sit at the intersection of Europe’s major policy challenges: climate action, social cohesion, competitiveness, and resource security. By prioritising them in Council deliberations, Ireland can support outcomes that deliver tangible benefits for millions of Europeans. Impact for People Reducing food waste and expanding food redistribution directly improves food access for vulnerable households while lowering the cost burden on public services. Supporting the development of circular food infrastructure, such as efficient donation and redistribution channels, ensures that surplus food is used to feed people rather than being lost or wasted. This reduces inequality, strengthens community resilience, and contributes to the EU’s social fairness agenda. Continued protection of ESF+ food support programmes will be essential to sustaining these benefits. Impact for Businesses Businesses stand to gain significantly from more circular, efficient food systems. Reducing waste lowers costs, improves productivity, and increases competitiveness, key goals of the EU Strategic Agenda. Initiatives such as FoodCloud’s Growers’ Project demonstrate how farmers can capture greater value from their crops by ensuring that more of what they produce reaches consumers. Encouraging circular practices across supply chains supports economic resilience, reduces exposure to volatile global markets, and helps businesses meet growing regulatory expectations under EU climate and waste legislation. Digitisation further amplifies these benefits. FoodCloud’s Foodiverse platform has already demonstrated how technology can streamline redistribution, measure impact, and help food banks and businesses rescue more food effectively. By promoting EU-wide uptake of digital tools and ensuring flexible access to innovation funding, the Presidency can accelerate the modernisation of Europe’s food system while supporting SMEs and social enterprises. Impact for Communities Communities benefit when circular systems are normalised and supported. Strengthening redistribution networks, improving local food security, and reducing avoidable waste all contribute to social cohesion and local resilience. Circularity keeps value circulating within communities, reduces environmental pressures, and supports climate objectives by preventing the emissions embedded in food production from being wasted. Conclusion By championing circularity, food waste reduction, and innovation in food redistribution, the Irish Presidency can help build a Europe that is more secure, competitive, and resilient. These actions will deliver immediate and visible benefits for people, businesses, and communities, while reinforcing the EU’s long-term goals on climate action, resource efficiency, and social cohesion."
290,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/2a3f002f/FoodCloud_-_Submission_290.docx,FoodCloud,,,,4,"Communicating the values and benefits of EU membership requires making Europe real and relevant to people’s daily lives. Too often, the EU is perceived as distant or abstract, despite the profound impact its policies and programmes have on communities across Ireland and the wider Union. As Ireland prepares to assume the Presidency of the Council of the EU, there is an important opportunity to build understanding, pride, and a sense of ownership by showcasing practical examples of how EU cooperation improves lives. FoodCloud is a mission-driven organisation committed to transforming surplus food into opportunities to make the world a kinder, fairer place. Our values, kindness, collaboration, enterprise, and action align closely with the core values of the EU: human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. At the heart of our mission is a belief that everyone has the right to food and the opportunity to thrive. Strengthening the connection between these values and the lived experience of EU membership is vital to building public support and engagement. In a global context where protectionist and individualist narratives are gaining traction, communicating the EU’s benefits must be done in a positive, honest, and relatable manner. People connect most with real stories - stories of individuals, families, businesses, and communities whose lives are improved through cooperation, solidarity, and shared purpose. FoodCloud, as part of Irish civil society and as an SDG Champion for 2026–27, is committed to helping tell these stories in ways that resonate and inspire. Many people who benefit from EU programmes are not aware that these supports stem from EU decisions, funding, and shared values. For example, thousands of community groups across Ireland receive food support through the ESF+ programme, yet many individuals receiving this food may not know it is part of an EU initiative. Making these connections visible is essential for fostering public understanding and pride. FoodCloud proposes that Ireland’s Presidency include an event highlighting the community-level impact of ESF+. Building on the ESF+ launch event planned for May 2026, such an event could bring together EU policymakers, national officials, civil society organisations, and programme beneficiaries. By showcasing the real-world outcomes of EU social investment—families supported, food saved from waste, communities strengthened—the Presidency can illustrate the tangible, human impact of EU solidarity. Beyond a single event, communication should emphasise accessibility and participation. This includes using clear storytelling, digital content, and community-led engagement to demonstrate how EU policies on food waste, circularity, climate action, and social inclusion translate into real benefits for people and businesses. It also means involving citizens directly, inviting community groups, young people, and beneficiaries of EU programmes to share their experiences and perspectives. By grounding the Presidency in real stories of cooperation and impact, Ireland can help citizens across the EU understand not only what Europe does, but why it matters. This approach fosters a sense of ownership, pride, and connection, ensuring that the values at the heart of the European project remain meaningful, relevant, and shared by all."

We understand that a civil society event is planned for October 2026 and would be very keen to participate, whether through a community-based event such as the ESF+ impact gathering proposed earlier or through another format that aligns with the Presidency’s priorities. As an organisation rooted in collaboration and community impact, we believe we can add meaningful value by sharing practical examples of how EU policies translate into real benefits for people, businesses, and communities. FoodCloud will also serve as an SDG Champion during the overlapping period of the Presidency (2026– 27). We see this as a timely opportunity to help elevate the Sustainable Development Goals throughout the Presidency’s programme. While our work is most closely aligned with SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 12 (Responsible Production and Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals), we are committed to promoting the integrated nature of all 17 Goals. We would welcome opportunities to support Presidency events, outreach activities, or communications that highlight the SDGs’ relevance to EU cooperation, community wellbeing, and strategic resilience. FoodCloud is ready to engage constructively with Government and EU partners to help demonstrate the value of collaboration, circularity, and shared European action throughout the Presidency year."
201,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/910c1a74/Solventum_-_Submission_201.docx,Solventum,Business,Health,International,1,"We believe the most important high-level priority for the Irish presidency should be the simplification of the regulatory burden and reduction in cost in order to boost the competitiveness of the EU. We believe at a time when Europe faces intense international competition from established economies like the United States and emerging economic forces like China, the EU must immediately adapt and make doing business as easy as possible. This should not be interpreted as a call for deregulation. It remains imperative that Europe maintains high standards. However, high standards and regulatory simplification are not mutually exclusive and can ensure that the EU becomes more attractive to investment."
201,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/910c1a74/Solventum_-_Submission_201.docx,Solventum,Business,Health,International,2,"We would draw the Department’s attention to issues relating to the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR), in particular for medical devices used in out-of-hospital settings. We believe it is appropriate that devices should be regulated by MDR and should not be regulated by consumer-orientated regulations. Further, Solventum would like to see an accelerated approach to getting electronic instructions for use for medical devices used under professional direction in the community (i.e. on prescription or other direction of a medical professional). At the moment, only devices used in professional settings such as hospitals can have electronic instructions for use and we would like to see this expanded. In wound care, it is not unusual for the same product to be used in hospitals and in the community – but currently electronic instructions for use can only be used for products used in hospitals. This is especially critical given the growth in the use of medical devices in community settings under the direction of healthcare professionals. The shift in healthcare delivery from hospital to out-of-hospital care is vital to reducing the cost of care. Receiving professional care in the home environment is also generally preferred by patients. Patients living with diabetes, incontinence, stomas or recovering from major surgery are increasingly treated at home. They use professional medical devices under the direction of a medical professional, but they do so at home. More generally, there are systematic challenges related to the interplay between MDR, consumer and environmental legislation that need to be addressed. Provisions of EU consumer and/or environmental legislation create misaligned compliance requirements, regulatory duplication and inflated costs. In line with strategic goals to achieve regulatory simplification and improve European competitiveness, finding solutions for these regulatory challenges is essential. A few examples of such misalignments include unique identifier requirements duplication or the Right to Repair Directive, which conflicts with MDR rules specifying that only trained professionals may repair devices. Broader consumer and environmental frameworks (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation and Batteries Regulation) also apply by default to medical devices, increasing complexity and inconsistencies across Member States. Improving the interplay between the MDR and consumer legislation is crucial to unlock the potential of out-of-hospital care, improve patient outcomes and deliver more sustainable healthcare services. Secondly, we believe that the Irish Presidency should prioritise trade and strive to develop a stronger and more stable trading relationship with the USA on behalf of the EU. Ireland is uniquely placed among EU members to drive an improvement in trading terms with the US. Specifically, this should be to seek an exemption for EU-origin medical devices from Section 232 tariffs (as UK has done) and also to reduce the current 15% tariff rate on medical devices exported from the EU to the US. We also believe the simplification of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) should be completed in good order to ensure confusion and the over-burdening of industry on the matter is dealt with."
201,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/910c1a74/Solventum_-_Submission_201.docx,Solventum,Business,Health,International,3,"Strong co-operation between the private and public sectors are invaluable to a properly functioning economy and vibrant society. Both sectors have a common interest at heart and share the objectives of safety and sustainability - and regulation should always be fair, balanced and communicated effectively. With this in mind, we believe that communication from the Commission and national governments to business needs to be substantially improved. For example, the biggest issue in implementing the EUDR for many businesses has been the constant changing of policy - whilst the world has been watching. This has led to, at times, confusion and misunderstanding about the Commission’s policy positions, which is not only far from optimal, but can lead to ineffective implementation and adherence to important regulation. We recommend that the Commission adopt more of a hands-on approach to effective communication with business on policy development to ensure greater understanding. Solventum suppliers have been quoting back to us that EUDR is delayed – when actually this is merely an aspiration or a position taken in a debate. These suppliers are not willfully misinterpreting what is happening – it’s because communication is poor. Business needs time to implement change – because many companies have huge and complex supply chains stretching across the world. And it needs crystal clear communication."
201,https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/910c1a74/Solventum_-_Submission_201.docx,Solventum,Business,Health,International,4,"We would suggest a coordinated approach to communicating with different groups. Whilst consumers and citizens will be keen to be reminded of the benefits of membership, business and industry will be keen to hear and understand those benefits through a different lens. There are many pieces of legislation with extra-territorial aspects eg EUDR, CSDDD. It cannot solely be the job of companies like Solventum to communicate EU policy to vast, complicated supply chains across the globe. If the EU insists on extra-territorial aspects to its regulations, then it needs to be prepared to communicate better with stakeholders in these other countries – with industry associations, via national governments and potentially with individual companies. Further, we propose that Ireland’s Presidency should establish a new forum for discussion and communication between business and the Commission that lasts into the future, long after the Irish Presidency has ended. Business often feels that ‘things are done to them’ – that they have little opportunity to discuss the implications of regulations before they are decided. For regulation that impacts business in a significant way – or adds costs, then mechanisms should be put in place to enable business to co-create future regulation. “No decision about us, without us”. The Commission generally does a good job of consulting – but it consults after the proposal is crafted….and business needs to be involved at concept stage. Too often, the EU forces behaviour change with a great big (costly) stick – carrots also work. This would be a fitting legacy."

Thematic priorities: These priorities would position Ireland as a facilitator of inclusive growth: Localising the Green Deal: Community-Led Climate Action To progress action toward the EU’s climate neutrality goals, Ireland’s Presidency should focus on the ""social acceptance"" of the Green Deal. Ireland should prioritise legislative and policy frameworks that facilitate a transition to community-led climate, energy and circular economy initiatives. EU investment in governance models that enable greater levels of citizen engagement and CLLD will ensure that investments in renewable energy and biodiversity generate tangible economic returns for local populations rather than extraction by external organisations. This supports a ""Just Transition"" by making empowering citizens to become active stakeholders in energy security. Social Innovation and Demographic Revitalization Addressing the ""geography of discontent"" requires a focus on social cohesion. Ireland’s Presidency should prioritise investment in community animation, activation and capacity building resources to develop and support a strong culture of community led Social Innovation and Social Enterprise, as critical drivers of rural revitalisation and renewal, particularly in areas facing demographic decline and service withdrawal. Progressing implementation of the EU Social Economy Action Plan should focus on state aid modernisation and funding simplification that support social enterprises to fill gaps in public and private service provision (care, housing, transport, circular economy, energy). This will empower communities to co design solutions to critical problems such as housing, aging demographics and youth migration. 3. The “Smart Rural” Agenda: Digital Equity and Competitiveness Connecting to the EU competitiveness agenda, Ireland’s Presidency should advocate for a shift from purely infrastructural metrics (broadband coverage) to capacity building (digital adoption) and smart village led innovation. A strong focus on community animation, activation and capacity building to empower citizens to identify priorities, co design and develop solutions, and build social capital will help reduce the urban rural digital divide, help unlock the rural economy, and ensure rural areas are integrated into the Single Market as dynamic areas of innovation, rather than peripheral areas of decline."

Investment in Community Animation, Activation and Capacity Building A gap in EU policy implementation is inadequate investment in community animation, activation and capacity-building. Communities possess vision but often lack dedicated facilitation, training, and mentoring support to translate potential into action. Ireland's Presidency should recognise the critical role that outreached animation and capacity building play in democratic participation and policy implementation, and advocate for substantial EU level allocations to support core community development work, local animation and capacity building programmes, and community-led local development delivery methodologies. 2. Investment in a National Civil Society Match Funding Scheme for EU Competitive Funds A critical barrier preventing Irish civil society organisations from accessing EU competitive funding is co financing requirements. While the EU typically funds 60-70% of project costs in competitive funding calls, Civil Society Organisations must source the shortfall from other sources. This is a significant challenge for organisations with limited revenue streams, and results in Ireland drawing down far less EU investment than potentially available and limits civil society participation in and learning from EU programmes and partners. Ireland should establish a national match funding scheme administered by the Regional Assemblies. This mechanism would unlock substantial EU investment while enabling grassroots organisations to contribute to EU priorities."

A suitable overarching theme is: A Europe for All Ages: Dignity, Participation and Solidarity. Three priority themes are proposed. First, Rights and Inclusion Across the Life Course, recognising that ageing is a lifelong process and that policy should ensure opportunities, supports and protections at all stages of life. A rights based approach should underpin this work, guaranteeing dignity, participation, access to services and protection from discrimination, including ageism. Second, Sustainable and Inclusive Societies, supporting Member States to anticipate demographic change, strengthen social protection, promote ageing in place and invest in age friendly environments. This includes financial sustainability that does not frame older populations as a burden but sees demographic change as an opportunity for innovation, participation and economic resilience. Third, Intergenerational Solidarity and Engagement, encouraging structured dialogue between generations, and recognising older people’s contributions through volunteering, caring, mentoring, civic engagement and cultural enrichment. This approach aligns with the EU Strategic Agenda 2024 to 2029, reinforces fairness and cohesion and positions Ireland to demonstrate leadership on rights based and inclusive policymaking across the Union."

The best way for the EU to become more independent is to strengthen its own economy by preventing brain drain. For this to happen the European Union must invest into the future of its youth by making education a priority and the younger generations an impetus to pursue higher education in Europe. European Economic power, prosperity, social cohesion and independence lie in a strong higher education that is well-equipped to respond to tomorrow’s challenges. The Erasmus+ programme is the biggest international student mobility programme worldwide. It allows around 500,000 European students each year to participate in academic mobility, making it the flagship programme for higher education in Europe. International mobility experiences foster a sense of European values while also deepening intercultural and interpersonal competences among those who participate. . Guided by the principles of equity and inclusion, the programme reflects the democratic values cherished in our societies, but which are increasingly undermined by actors within and outside of the EU. In this context, the programme stands as a vital instrument for strengthening our democratic fabric, expanding civic trust, and keeping the Union resilient. In 2023 alone, Ireland supported over 35 000 Erasmus+ students in incoming and outgoing mobility, demonstrating a pioneering approach to inclusive student mobility. For this reason the Irish Presidency can make an important contribution to the success of the Erasmus+ programme by ensuring inclusion and resilience in (higher) education."

The proposals for the EU’s next long-term budget and the regulation establishing the Erasmus+ programme (2028-2034) provide very little clarity on what education as a sector can anticipate in the next funding period. Through a restructuring of the programme and new policy priorities, a greater focus will be placed on developing skills and attracting and retaining talent, thereby shifting the emphasis away from the societal benefits of higher education and its role in personal development of an entire continent. Higher education plays an essential role in ensuring the resilience and safety of the continent, especially in the currently uncertain geopolitical situation. Development of critical skills, independent research, and freedom of thought foster an engaged and informed citizenry. Thus the next Multiannual Financial Framework needs to reflect that role with a sufficient budget allocation that is significantly higher than in the proposal made by the European Commission. Regulation establishing Erasmus+ programme (2028-2034) and the subsequent Work Programme and Programme Guide for 2028. The flexibility of the programme and streamlining of the processes cannot come at the expense of stability and predictability for the higher education institutions and other beneficiaries. Additionally, the regulation for the Erasmus+ programme needs timely adoption to ensure there are no delays for the next funding period and higher education institutions will not experience any disruptions to their international activities. The Irish Presidency should also aim to bring together various stakeholders, such as national Erasmus+ agencies, civil society organisations and higher education practitioners to work together and shape the future of the Erasmus+ programme. For this, the questions of inclusion in the programme, programme governance and its stability during the transition period would make up much welcomed debates/working groups. The Erasmus+ programme can be elevated on the agenda of the European Union through this work, and Ireland can play an important role in ensuring a smooth transition between the programme periods and have a significant influence on its future."

Prevent structural under-funding of the Erasmus+ programme. The proposal presented by the European Commission for EU’s next long-term budget, while presented as having a 50% increase, is nominal, and maintains the same progression of funding for Erasmus+ programme when compared to the current Multiannual Financial Framework. At the same time, new actions are added to the successor programme, including the integration of the European Solidarity Corps under the Erasmus+ umbrella, de facto decreasing funding allocation for existing actions that are already structurally underfunded. Approximately 50% of student mobilities cannot be funded due to lack of funding. Only 10% of cooperation partnership project applications fuelling bottom-up initiatives in higher education are funded, to name a few examples. The budget proposal not only mismatches the demand for the EU’s flagship initiative, it also falls short of the ambition put forward by the Member States of reaching the mobility targets. To attain the targets set out in the Council Recommendation “Europe on the Move”, Erasmus+ budget for student mobility would have to increase at least by 55% compared to the current budget allocation. Ensuring continuity of the Erasmus+ programme and avoiding disruptions. The Erasmus+ programme is a unique European programme funding 500,000 student mobilities every year and functions as a crucial stream for project funding for European higher education institutions. For this reason, the beneficiaries, namely Higher Educational Institutions, need to be able to anticipate the impact of proposed policies on their institution. Due to the disruptions witnessed during the previous transition period in 2021 with a late start of the programme, many HEIs and beneficiaries are concerned that the same will occur in 2028.. Similarly, HEIs need predictability and timely information when it concerns changes in existing actions, i.e. the requirements for project applications, mobility funding allocations, IT systems updates and developments, etc. With the changes foreseen to the Erasmus+ successor programme and new actions coming into focus, HEIs need to be consulted and have a say in the upcoming changes to ensure the developments are fit for purpose, simplification measures serve the higher education community, and funding allocations are not meeting unexpected cuts. Safeguard and support cross-border collaboration opportunities enabling bottom-up initiatives in the next Erasmus+ programme. Cooperation Partnership projects, currently under KA2 in Erasmus+ programme, have proven to have high added value and long-lasting impact beyond the project timeline and scope of the deliverables. Despite the action being rated as one of the most (cost-)effective in the current funding period, the sharp decrease in its budget, combined with significantly increased interest from the higher education community, is driving success rates below 10% and causing many high-quality proposals to be rejected. In times when HEIs are experiencing national budget cuts, Erasmus+ can serve as an opportunity to further the cross-border collaboration that otherwise might not be possible."

As a result of meaningful involvement in ongoing processes, civil society organisations can serve as multipliers of the policies and priorities of decision-makers, and establish communication channels with grassroots organisations and society. These practices would also support creating a sense of ownership and ensuring the Erasmus+ programme is adopting good governance.

As a network of higher education institutions, EUF has long standing experience and extensive expertise in internationalisation of higher education. One of the priority areas identified by EUF is inclusivity of the Erasmus+ programme with an outlook to medium term solutions, as well as long-term. As funding remains one of the main deterrents to student participation in credit mobility, EUF together with partner universities, students and rectors’ council, has developed a proposal for new semester-long mobility grant calculation methodology that would ensure transparency to the beneficiaries, equal treatment of all participants regardless of their background and enable more students to pursue mobility opportunities. In addition, the proposal, if implemented, would also foster simplification of the mobility administration processes, allowing international relations offices to dedicate more of their time and resources to quality aspects of the mobility instead of administrative tasks. The methodology is based on allocation of a baseline grant to all students participating in long-term credit mobility (currently KA131), that would be topped up with a cost of living supplement should the student choose a host city that is more expensive than their home city. This grant would better reflect the expenses incurred by students during their mobility periods, changing the perception of the students regarding the affordability of learning mobility.

Ireland has implemented progressive laws and policies and been an increasingly strong champion of SRHR within EU and UN multilateral spaces in recent years. As Ireland takes as place on the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Commission on Population and Development, as well as its EU role, and at a time when EU values are being attacked and policy and legal advances in support of the rights of marginalized groups are under threat in many parts of Europe and the world, Ireland’s support for SRHR, as essential to sustainable development and the attainment of the SGDs and as critical to the realization of human rights and democracy will be more important than ever. This requires both proactively reiterating the human rights values of the EU states with respect to SRHR and international human rights law (IHRL), and, at the same time, challenging both roll-back on these rights and their undermining through initiatives such as the Geneva Consensus Declaration (GCD). The GCD aims to create false equivalences between the normative framework of IHRL and a non-negotiated statement that (1) attacks sexual and reproductive rights under the guise of a purported defence of “traditional families” and (2) aims to limit the application of IHRL by privileging national sovereignty over the principle of the indivisibility, interdependence, inalienability and universality of IHRL. Ireland should use its role as the EU’s diplomatic voice in multilateral arenas to promote human rights and gender equality, foster stronger coordination among like-minded partners (including global south governments), and build coalitions to promote SRHR and to counter anti-rights and anti-gender narratives.
